\section{Introduction}

Why is this important and interesting?

Please explain the backgroundas well.

Two example paragraphs follow.

In online social networks such as Facebook (\url{www.facebook.com}), Youtube
(\url{www.youtube.com}), Twitter (\url{www.twitter.com}), etc., people share
different content such as messages, videos, songs, opinions, blogs, etc.  In
another important form of networks---peer-to-peer networks---files are shared.
In both these cases, reputation of a peer matters; otherwise a user may get
exposed to objectionable content such as a virus.  Thus, the trust that other
users impart on a node is an important attribute of it.  Slashdot
(\url{www.slashdot.org}) and Epinions (\url{www.epinions.com}) are networks
where explicit opinions of a user as trust and distrust are available.

A network based on trust is quite different from other networks. An explicit
link in a network such as Facebook, Youtube signifies that two nodes are close.
However, in a trust based network, two nodes may be close and may be connected
but the link may show distrust.  More importantly, a neutral opinion in a trust
based network is quite different from a no-connection.  Consider a simple
example where node $A$ has $1000$ neutral opinions and $10$ negative opinions
about it and another node $B$ has only $10$ negative opinions about it.  It is
intuitive that node $A$ has a higher reputation.  However, if the neutral
opinion is modeled by the absence of an edge, the two nodes behave the same.
This indicates that neutral opinion is not the same as a no-connection.  In
other words, an edge with $0$ weight is different from an edge that is absent.
