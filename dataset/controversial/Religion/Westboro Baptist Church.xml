Its first [[Church service|public service]] was held on the afternoon of Sunday, November 27, 1955.&lt;ref name=&quot;date-sermon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.godhatesamerica.com/sound/ghfsermons/OSBH19880131.mp3|title=Sermon preached by Fred Phelps|year=1987|accessdate=January 14, 2012|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061208014706/http://www.godhatesamerica.com/sound/ghfsermons/OSBH19880131.mp3 |archivedate = December 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The church has been actively involved in the anti-gay movement since at least 1991 when it sought a crackdown on homosexual activity at [[Gage Park, Topeka|Gage Park]] six blocks northwest of the church.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, K. Ryan (2008), ''Fall from Grace'' (documentary)&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to anti-gay protests at military funerals, the organization pickets other celebrity funerals and public events that are likely to get it media attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wing|first=Nick|title=Elizabeth Edwards Funeral To Be Picketed By Westboro Baptist Church|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/09/elizabeth-edwards-funeral-westboro-baptist-church_n_794333.html|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=12/9/10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protests have also been held demonstrating against Jews and some protests included stomping on the [[flag of the United States]].

The WBC is not affiliated with any known [[Baptist]] conventions or associations and the two largest Baptist denominations, the [[Baptist World Alliance]] and the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] have denounced the WBC over the years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://au.christiantoday.com/article/baptists-denounce-latest-westboro-stunt/5495.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The church describes itself as following [[Primitive Baptist]] and [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Westboro Baptist Church|url=http://www.godhatesfags.com/wbcinfo/aboutwbc.html|work=God Hates Fags|publisher=Westboro Baptist Church|accessdate=October 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Westboro Baptist Church originated as a branch of the East Side Baptist Church in Topeka, established in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://esbcks.org/esbc2.0/index.php/who-we-are/church-history |title=Church History |last=Plummer |first=Darlene |year=2010 |work=East Side Baptist Church |location=Topeka, Kansas |accessdate=September 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954, East Side hired Phelps as an associate pastor, and then promoted him to be the pastor of their new church, Westboro Baptist, which opened in 1956.&lt;ref name=&quot;fate&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Fate, timing kept Phelps in Topeka |first=Joe |last=Taschler |last2=Fry |first2=Steve |url=http://cjonline.com/indepth/phelps/stories/080394_phelps13.shtml |newspaper=Topeka Capital-Journal |date=August 3, 1994 |accessdate=September 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after Westboro was established, Phelps broke all ties with East Side Baptist.

==Protest activities==
Phelps and his family picket approximately six locations every day, including many in Topeka and some events farther afield. On Sundays, up to 15 churches may receive pickets.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Fred (April 2, 2006), &quot;[http://www.kansas.com/mld/kansas/living/religion/14243282.htm Road to Westboro: What led Fred Phelps to his beliefs and actions?]&quot;, ''Wichita Eagle'', Retrieved August 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20070102151809/http://www.godhatesfags.com/main/index.html &quot;The Westboro Baptist Church Home Page&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; By their own count, WBC has picketed in all 50 U.S. states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=animation|url=http://animation.speakfree.net/video/sott/wbcvn/qt/20070929ussenateframesmischiefbyalaw.mov|archiveurl=http://wayback.archive.org/web/*/http://animation.speakfree.net/video/sott/wbcvn/qt/20070929ussenateframesmischiefbyalaw.mov|archivedate=February 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group carries out daily picketing in [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]] and travels nationally to picket the funerals of gay victims of murder, gay-bashing or people who have died from complications relating to AIDS; other events related or peripherally related to gay people; [[Kansas City Chiefs]] [[American football|football]] games; and live pop concerts. As of March 2009 the church claims to have participated in over 41,000 protests in over 650 cities since 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.godhatesfags.com/picketlocations.html | title = Picket Locations | accessdate =March 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Westboro's followers estimated that the church spends $250,000 a year on picketing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,,1755712,00.html |work=The Guardian |location=London  | title=Anti-gay church hounds military funerals | first=Julian | last=Borger | date=April 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pickets have resulted in several lawsuits. In 1995, Phelps Sr.'s eldest grandson, Benjamin Phelps, was convicted of assault and disorderly conduct after spitting upon the face of a passerby during a picket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cjonline.com/indepth/phelps/stories/052497_phelps.shtml |first=Roger|last=Myers|title=Appeals court upholds Phelpses' convictions|work=The Topeka Capital-Journal|date=May 24, 1997|accessdate=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s the church won a series of lawsuits against the City of Topeka and [[Shawnee County]] for efforts taken to prevent or hinder WBC picketing, and was awarded approximately $200,000 in [[attorney's fee]]s and costs associated with the litigation. In 2004, Margie Phelps and her son Jacob were arrested for [[trespassing]], disorderly conduct and failure to obey after disregarding a police officer's order during an attempted protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In the autumn of 2007, the father of a [[US Marines|Marine]] whose funeral was picketed by the WBC was awarded $5&amp;nbsp;million in damages.&lt;ref name=&quot;funeral&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,305279,00.html|title=Father of Marine Killed in Iraq Sues Church for Cheering Death|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=October 26, 2007| date=October 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;funeral2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cjonline.com/stories/040408/loc_264906171.shtml|title=Walls close in on Phelpses|first=Mike|last=Hall|work=The Topeka Capital-Journal|date=April 4, 2008|accessdate=September 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The award was later overturned on appeal by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit|Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals]] in a decision upheld by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in ''[[Snyder v. Phelps]]''. In June 2007 [[Shirley Phelps-Roper]] was arrested in Nebraska and charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor. The arrest resulted from her allowing her eight-year-old son to step on the American flag during the demonstration, which is illegal under Nebraska law. The defense contends that the child's actions were protected speech, and that the state law is unconstitutional. The prosecution claimed that the demonstration was not intended as political speech, but as an incitement to violence, and that Phelps-Roper's conduct may also constitute [[child abuse]]. Prosecutors later dropped charges against Phelps-Roper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcactionnews.com/dpp/news/region_kansas/prosecutors-drop-charges-against-phelps-roper-in-funeral-protest-case|title=Prosecutors drop charges against Phelps-Roper in funeral protest case|publisher=[[KSHB-TV]]|location=Kansas City, MO|date=August 23, 2010|accessdate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On two occasions, the church accepted offers for radio air time in exchange for canceling an announced protest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/insane-amish-protest-dropped/2006/10/05/1159641433255.html {{&quot;'}}Insane' picketers cancel Amish funeral protest&quot;], ''The Age'', Associated Press, October 5, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=LH&amp;p_theme=lh&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;s_dispstring=westboro%20baptist%20AND%20date(all)&amp;p_field_advanced-0=&amp;p_text_advanced-0=(westboro%20baptist)&amp;xcal_numdocs=20&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;xcal_useweights=no |first=Steve|last=Lannon|title=Group drops protest plan at fire victims' funeral|work=Lexington Herald-Leader|date=February 7, 2007|accessdate=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-gay picketing===
While being filmed by documentary film-maker [[Louis Theroux]], they picketed a local appliance store because it sold Swedish vacuum cleaners, which the church viewed as supportive of gays because of Swedish prosecution of [[Åke Green]], a pastor critical of homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Louis|last=Theroux |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2007/mar/31/tvandradio.usnews |title=God's Squad|work=The Guardian |location=London |date= March 31, 2007|accessdate=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WBC 20051202 sacco-topeka5.jpg|thumb|Picketing in Topeka, with the group's signature rainbow-colored picket signs.]]
The church has picketed, or threatened to picket, productions of ''[[The Laramie Project]]'', a play based on the murder of [[Matthew Shepard]], whose funeral they also picketed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Moore |first=Matthew |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/4640967/Westboro-Baptist-Church-announces-first-anti-homosexuality-picket-in-Britain.html |title=Westboro Baptist Church announces first anti-homosexuality picket in Britain |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=February 16, 2009 |accessdate=March 31, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kare11.com/news/news_article.aspx?storyid=103703 |location=Minneapolis|title=Controversial Church to picket Marine's funeral|publisher=[[KARE]]|date=August 1, 2005|accessdate=March 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 25, 2004, Phelps picketed five churches (three Catholic and two [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]]) and the Federal Courthouse for what he said was their part in legitimizing [[same-sex marriage]]s in Iowa. A community response was to hold counter-protests and a multifaith service in the municipal auditorium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siouxcityjournal.com/articles/2008/01/16/news/latest_news/862d48fdedcbc6b9862573d200742a03.txt &quot;Gay marriage case looms over chief justice's speech&quot;]. ''Sioux City Journal''. January 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 15, 2006, Westboro members protested a memorial for [[2006 Sago Mine disaster]] victims, claiming that the mining accident was God's revenge against America for its tolerance of homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kake.com/news/headlines/2206092.html |title=Controlling Funeral Protests?|publisher=KAKE|location=Wichita, KS|date=January 16, 2006 |accessdate=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funeral pickets===
The group came into the national spotlight in 1998, when it was featured on [[CNN]] for picketing the funeral of Matthew Shepard, a young man from Wyoming who was [[gay bashing|beaten to death by two men because of his homosexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9810/12/wyoming.attack.03/index.html|title=Murder charges planned in beating death of gay student|date=October 12, 1998|publisher=CNN|accessdate=December 28, 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20000607204809/http://cnn.com/US/9810/12/wyoming.attack.03/index.html|archivedate=June 7, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the church has attracted attention for many more actual and planned funeral pickets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tpnevolve.com/node/8893|title=Church group to protest Pitt|work=The Pitt News|location=University of Pittsburgh|first=Michelle|last=Scott|date=March 8, 2003|accessdate=January 14, 2011|archivedate=July 21, 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100721205104/http://www.tpnevolve.com/node/8893}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thekansascitychannel.com/news/4816699/detail.html &quot;Phelps' Group Protests At Soldier's Funeral&quot;].

In July 2005, the Westboro Baptist Church declared its intention to picket the memorial service of Carrie French in [[Boise, Idaho]]. French, 19, was killed on June 5 in [[Kirkuk]], Iraq, where she served as an ammunition specialist with the 116th Brigade Combat Team's 145th Support Battalion. Phelps Sr. said, &quot;Our attitude toward what's happening with the war is the Lord is punishing this evil nation for abandoning all moral imperatives that are worth a dime.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Oxley, Chuck (June 14, 2005).

On February 2, 2008, the group picketed during the funeral of former [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS Church]] [[President of the Church|president]] [[Gordon B.

===Protests against Jewish institutions===
[[File:Baptists-against-jews.jpg|thumb|right|A protest against Jews, held by the Westboro Baptist Church.]]
In 1996 Phelps led a protest at the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] in Washington, D.C., proclaiming:

{{Quote|Whatever righteous cause the Jewish victims of the 1930s–40s Nazi Holocaust had, (probably minuscule, compared to the Jewish Holocausts against Middle Passage Blacks, African Americans and Christians—including the bloody persecution of Westboro Baptist Church by Topeka Jews in the 1990s), has been drowned in sodomite semen. American taxpayers are financing this unholy monument to Jewish mendacity and greed and to filthy fag lust. Homosexuals and Jews dominated Nazi Germany ... The Jews now wander the earth despised, smitten with moral and spiritual blindness by a divine judicial stroke ... And God has smitten Jews with a certain unique madness ... Jews, thus perverted, out of all proportion to their numbers energize the militant sodomite agenda... Jews are the real Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/special_reports/wbc/wbc_on_jews.asp|title=Extremism in America:Westboro Baptist Church In Their Own Words: On Jews |publisher=The Anti-Defamation League}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

WBC was present at a 2002 Holocaust memorial dedication in Topeka, proclaiming &quot;God Hates [[Reform Judaism]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.godhatesfags.com/fliers/may2002/Holocaust_5-11-2002.pdf Flier from God Hates Fags (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 8, 2009, members of the church protested at three Jewish sites in Washington, D.C., including the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) offices, the [[U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum]] and the city's largest synagogue. Margie Phelps, daughter of Pastor [[Fred Phelps]], led the protest, holding signs stating that &quot;God Hates Israel&quot;, &quot;Jews Killed Jesus&quot;, &quot;America Is Doomed&quot;, &quot;Israel Is Doomed&quot;, and &quot;ADL Jew Bullies&quot;. The protest was apparently part of a series of upcoming protests which the church has planned at Jewish institutions in [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], South Florida and [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]]. The group reportedly posted a list of the upcoming protests' locations and dates, along with the statement &quot;Jews Killed the Lord Jesus.&quot;&lt;ref name=JTA1&gt;[http://jta.org/news/article/2009/05/12/1005095/militant-anti-gay-church-turns-its-sights-on-jews Militant anti-gay church turns its sights on Jews] by Eric Fingerhut, Jewish Telegraphic Agency (JTA), May 12, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview, Margie Phelps said that her church was targeting the [[American Jews|American Jewish community]] because church members had &quot;testified&quot; to gentiles for 19&amp;nbsp;years that &quot;America is doomed&quot; and that &quot;Now it's too late. We're done with them.&quot; Phelps also claimed Jews were &quot;one of the loudest voices&quot; in favor of homosexuality and abortion and that &quot;[Jews] claim to be God's chosen people. Do you think that God is going to wink at that forever?&quot; Phelps concluded by stating, in an apparent reference to the [[Book of Revelation]], that all the nations of the world would soon march on [[Israel]], and that they would be led by President [[Barack Obama]], whom she called the &quot;[[Antichrist]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=JTA1/&gt;

===Other protest activities===

On January 26, 2008, WBC traveled to [[Jacksonville, North Carolina]], home of [[Camp Lejeune]], to protest the [[United States Marine Corps]] in the wake of the murder of [[Maria Lauterbach]]. Five women protested, stomping on the American flag and shouting slogans such as &quot;1,2,3,4, God Hates the Marine Corps&quot;. A group of over 40 counter-protesters arrived and one spat in [[Shirley Phelps-Roper]]'s face.&lt;ref&gt;Gale, Heather (January 26, 2008), [http://www.jdnews.com/news/church_54654___article.html/military_flag.html &quot;Church group draws counterprotest&quot;], [[Jacksonville Daily News|''Jacksonville'' (NC) ''Daily News'']], retrieved June 14, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Another counter-protest was held across town, which attracted over 150 counterprotesters.

===No shows===
{{refimprove section|date=July 2012}}
The church has also sometimes issued press releases threatening to picket sensitive events such as funerals and memorials, but did not follow through on these threats. Examples include the funerals of [[Joe Paterno]], Roy Tisdale, Charlie and Braden Powell, [[Steve Jobs]], [[Whitney Houston]] and victims of the [[I-35 bridge collapse]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012|reason=these all probably should be cited}} The church later [[Photo manipulation|manipulated photos]] to make it appear as though they had picketed Houston's funeral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Westboro will picket his funeral|first=Steve|last=Huff|date=February 19, 2012|url=http://observer.com/2012/02/westboro-baptist-didnt-protest-whitney-houstons-funeral-but-wanted-you-to-think-they-did/|publisher=The Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Church views==
[[File:WBC protest.jpg|right|thumb|A WBC member and child protesting homosexuality at the Trinity Episcopal Church in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]]]
The Westboro Baptist Church considers membership in most religious groups, such as the Roman Catholic Church or Islam, as akin to [[Theistic Satanism|devil worship]], and states these other churches to be &quot;Satanic frauds preaching [[Arminianism|Arminian]] lies&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.godhatesfags.com/written/wbcinfo/memoonthechurch.pdf |title=Memo on the Church | accessdate=March 21, 2009 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080602211609/http://www.godhatesfags.com/written/wbcinfo/memoonthechurch.pdf |archivedate = June 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; All non-Christian entities, non-Protestant Christian churches, and all Protestant Christian churches that do not strongly condemn homosexuality or align their beliefs and practices exactly with that of the WBC are said to be sending their members to Hell.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Purpose of protests and church actions===

In the BBC documentary ''[[The Most Hated Family in America]]'', filmmaker Louis Theroux questioned Shirley Phelps-Roper as to whether she had considered that Westboro's technique of protests were more likely to &quot;put people ''off'' the Word of Jesus Christ and the Bible&quot;.

In response, Phelps-Roper said as to the purpose of the protests, &quot;''You'' think our job is to win souls to Christ. All we do, by getting in their face and putting these signs in front of them and these plain words, is make what's already in their heart come out of their mouth.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc-doc&quot;&gt;{{Cite video | people = Theroux, Louis | title = The Most Hated Family in America  | url = http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1000764/ | medium = Television documentary |publisher=BBC | date = 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the documentary, Phelps-Roper agrees that the $200,000 the church annually spends to fly to funerals to protest was money spent to spread &quot;God's hate&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc-doc&quot;/&gt;

===Views on homosexuality===
The church is noted for its anti-gay rhetoric&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Anti-gay church to participate in debate on gay marriage ban|url=http://www.tcpalm.com/news/2008/oct/15/anti-gay-church-participate-debate-gay-marriage-ba/|date=October 15, 2008|first=Scott|last=Travis|work=[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]|location=Fort Lauderdale|accessdate=September 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=U.S. Supreme Court: Anti-gay protests at soldier funerals are constitutional|url=http://jacksonville.com/news/metro/2011-03-03/story/us-supreme-court-anti-gay-protests-soldier-funerals-are-constitutional|date=March 3, 2011|first=Jeff|last=Brumley|work=[[The Florida Times-Union]]|location=Jacksonville|accessdate=September 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and runs numerous web sites such as GodHatesFags.com, GodHatesAmerica.com and others expressing condemnation of homosexuality.

The group bases its work on the belief expressed by its best known slogan and the address of its primary web site, God Hates Fags, asserting that every tragedy in the world is linked to homosexuality—specifically society's increasing tolerance and acceptance of the so-called [[homosexual agenda]]. The group maintains that God hates gays above all other kinds of &quot;sinners&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wbc-faq&quot;&gt;[http://www.godhatesfags.com/faq.html#Focus &quot;Westboro Baptist Church FAQ&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; and that homosexuality should be a [[capital punishment|capital crime]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.godhatesfags.com/fliers/dec2002/Outlaw_Sodomy_12-3-2002.pdf &quot;Outlaw Sodomy&quot;], December 3, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Their views on homosexuality are partially based on teachings found in the [[Old Testament]], specifically Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13, which they interpret to mean that homosexual behavior is detestable, and that homosexuals should be put to death, respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;wbc-faq&quot;/&gt;

===Views on religions===

====Catholicism====
Westboro Baptist refers to Catholic priests as &quot;[[vampire]]s&quot; and &quot;[[Dracula]]s&quot; and talks of Catholic priests sucking semen out of male children's genitals like vampires suck blood from their victims. In addition, WBC calls [[Pope Benedict XVI]] such [[epithet]]s as &quot;The Godfather of [[pedophilia|Pedophile]]s&quot; and &quot;Pervert Pope&quot;. In April 2008 the WBC protested Pope Benedict XVI during a papal visit in New York City.

[[Image:Westboro Baptist Church in New York by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|WBC member protesting [[Pope Benedict XVI]] outside the United Nations in New York City (2008).]] The WBC launched a website called Priests Rape Boys in which they criticize the Roman Catholic Church because of the [[Catholic sex abuse cases|Catholic sex abuse scandal]], saying, &quot;Every time any person gives any amount of money to the Catholic Church, that person is paying the salary of pedophile rapists.&quot;&lt;ref name=Parishioners&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.priestsrapeboys.com/parishioners.html |title=Parishioners page at Priests Rape Boys |publisher=Priests Rape Boys|accessdate=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WBC describes the Roman Catholic Church as, &quot;the largest, most well-funded and organized pedophile group in the history of man&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.priestsrapeboys.com/ |title=Priests Rape Boys |publisher=Priests Rape Boys |accessdate=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and goes on to say that, &quot;There are over 1&amp;nbsp;billion Catholics in the world—that's one out of every six people alive today—and every single one of them will split Hell wide open when they die—period. And there is nothing they can do about it.&quot;&lt;ref name=Parishioners/&gt;

The WBC also criticizes Catholicism, as it does Eastern Orthodoxy, for [[veneration|venerating]] the [[Virgin Mary]], the [[Saints]], [[relics]], and [[icons]]; accusing the Catholic Church of committing [[idolatry]].

====Protestantism====
Though the main purpose of the Priests Rape Boys website is to criticize Catholicism, the WBC also criticizes several mainline Protestant churches on the website, including [[Methodists]], [[Presbyterians]], [[Lutherans]], [[Anglicans]], and [[Baptists]]. The WBC states that

{{quote|...their preachers have shirked their responsibility to tell people the truth about sin, and instead lie to them about what the Lord their God doth require of them. If these lying, false prophets told people the truth about what God says regarding those who suffer sin upon their neighbor (Lev. 19:17–18), there wouldn't be any butts in the seats when the plate got passed. These preachers are not preachers of righteousness, they are teachers having [[itching ears]] (2Tim 4:3), and they absolutely count on the abysmal bible illiteracy of their parishioners ... &quot;Priests rape boys&quot; is indeed an air-tight, three word case against all of the mainline &quot;christian&quot; churches – their preachers and members, without exception. They are all going to Hell!&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.priestsrapeboys.com/otherchurches.html &quot;Other Christian 'Churches' have gone ''awhoring'' after strange gods&quot;], PriestsRapeBoys.com&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Eastern Orthodoxy====
The WBC claims that [[Orthodox Christians]] are indistinguishable from Roman Catholics. The WBC criticizes the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]'s use of [[Eastern Orthodox icons|icons]], claiming that they constitute [[idolatry]]. The WBC also criticizes veneration of the [[Virgin Mary]], the [[Theotokos]], saying, &quot;There is no scripture that supports bowing down to kiss images ... or praying to Mary! She was a human being, who God predestinated to bring forth the Lord Jesus Christ, and to raise him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.godhatestheworld.com/russia/falsereligion.html &quot;Russia's False Religious Systems&quot;], ''God Hates Russia'', retrieved July 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

====Islam====
In response to a ''[[Newsweek]]'' article alleging that American soldiers flushed copies of the [[Qur'an]] down the toilet at [[Camp X-Ray]] in [[Guantanamo Bay detainment camp|Guantanamo Bay]], Fred Phelps released this statement:&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20050525085556/http://www.godhatesfags.com/fliers/may2005/20050519_week-726.pdf &quot;Statement from God Hates Fags&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|So what if our guys flushed copies of the Quran down the toilet? We hope they did. They probably did; We hope they flush more. Mohammed was a demon-possessed whoremonger and pedophile who contrived a 300-page work of Satanic fiction: The Quran! Like America's own whoremonger and pedophile wangled his own hokey [[Book of Mormon]]!}}

In relation to the [[Iraq War]], a WBC flyer says &quot;America bombed our church with an IED made by fag students... In His retaliatory rage God is killing Americans with Muslim IEDs: 'Saying, Touch not my anointed, and do my prophets no harm.' 1 Chron 16:22.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20070630110558/http://www.godhatesfags.com/fliers/mar2007/20070318_angel-rosa-funeral.pdf Flyer from God Hates Fags]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2011 documentary ''[[America's Most Hated Family in Crisis]]'' by [[Louis Theroux]], Megan Phelps-Roper explained in an interview that herself and the other members of the WBC tauntingly and publicly [[Quran desecration|burned]] a copy of the Quran while being scolded by a Muslim man, calling it an &quot;idolatrous piece of trash&quot; and that they were giving it the &quot;proper respect that it deserves&quot; by doing so.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; They picketed the funeral of the Muslim man's wife the following week. Megan stated that the cause of the wife's death was partly due to her Muslim husband having spoken out against the WBC, and therefore rejecting God and bringing His &quot;righteous judgement&quot; down upon him. She also commented that &quot;all those angry little Muslims can just shut their mouths.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''America's Most Hated Family in Crisis''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hinduism====
The WBC maintains a ''God Hates India'' webpage where they state &quot;80% of India's population claim to practice Hinduism. Nuff said. A country full of idolatry inevitably results in a nation full of fags and fag-enablers, because that's what happens when you depart from the Living God!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;godhatestheworld.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.godhatestheworld.com/india/falsereligion.html &quot;India's False Religious Systems&quot;], ''God Hates India'', retrieved July 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The WBC then admonishes [[Hindus]] to convert to Christianity saying: &quot;If you would STOP worshipping false gods, being a fag would not be a complex matter. Stop going a whoring after other gods and start serving the Living God in truth!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;godhatestheworld.com&quot;/&gt;

====Judaism====
In the section about Jews, the WBC FAQ states:

{{Quote|The only true Jews are Christians. The rest of the people who claim to be Jews aren't, and they are nothing more than typical, impenitent sinners ... the vast majority of Jews support fags.

In 1996, Phelps began a campaign called &quot;Topeka's Baptist Holocaust&quot;, whereby he attempted to draw attention to attacks perpetrated against WBC picketers, saying that they were not random but organized attacks orchestrated by Jews and homosexuals. Phelps announced, &quot;Jews killed Christ&quot;, and &quot;Fag Jew Nazis are worse than ordinary Nazis. They've had more experience. The First Holocaust was a Jewish Holocaust against Christians. The latest Holocaust is by Topeka Jews against Westboro Baptist Church.&quot;&lt;ref name=ADLITOW /&gt;

===Laws limiting funeral protests===
In response to the protests conducted by Westboro members at [[Indiana]] funerals, a bill was introduced in the [[Indiana General Assembly]] that would make it a [[felony]] to protest within  {{convert|500|ft|m}} of a funeral. The bill provides penalties of up to three years in prison and a $10,000 fine for those found to be in violation of the law. Shortly before this bill was signed members of the church had threatened to protest in [[Kokomo, Indiana]], at a funeral service that was being held for a soldier who was killed in Iraq. On January 11, 2006, the bill unanimously (11–0) passed a committee vote,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wndu.com/news/012006/news_47194.php &quot;Funeral protest bill passes out of committee, 11-0&quot;]{{dead link|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and while members of the church had traveled to Kokomo to protest, they were not seen during or after the funeral service. On May 23, 2006, the state of [[Michigan]] banned any intentional disruption of funerals within {{convert|500|ft|m}} of the ceremony. Violating the statute would be a felony, punishable by up to two years in prison and a $5,000 fine for the first offense and up to four years in prison and a $10,000 fine for a subsequent offense.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060723211636/http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/news.aspx?id=16931 firstamendmentcenter.org: news]&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 17, 2006, the state of [[Illinois]] enacted Senate Bill 1144, the &quot;Let Them Rest In Peace Act&quot;, to shield grieving military families from protests during funerals and memorial services of fallen military service members. A first-time violation of the Act is a Class C misdemeanor, punishable by up to 30&amp;nbsp;days in jail and a $1,500 fine and a Class 4 felony for a second or subsequent offense, which is punishable by one to three years in state prison and a fine of up to $25,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.illinois.gov/PressReleases/ShowPressRelease.cfm?SubjectID=1&amp;RecNum=4891 |title=Gov.

Other statements denounced them for raising their son Catholic. Snyder further complained the defendants had intruded upon and staged protests at his son's funeral. The claims of invasion of privacy and defamation arising from comments posted about Snyder on the Westboro website were dismissed on [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] grounds, but the case proceeded to trial on the remaining three counts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/local/carroll/bal-md.funeral16oct16,0,1389208.story &quot;Suit OK'd against anti-gay group&quot;].

In his instructions to the jury, U.S. District Judge [[Richard D. Bennett]] stated that the First Amendment protection of free speech has limits, including vulgar, offensive and shocking statements, and that the jury must decide &quot;whether the defendant's actions would be highly offensive to a reasonable person, whether they were extreme and outrageous and whether these actions were so offensive and shocking as to not be entitled to First Amendment protection&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,305279,00.html &quot;Father of Marine Killed in Iraq Sues Church for Cheering Death, Appeals to Public Online for Help&quot;], ''[[Fox News]]'', October 26, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire]], a case where certain personal slurs and obscene utterances by an individual were found unworthy of First Amendment protection, due to the potential for violence resulting from their utterance.

On October 31, 2007, WBC, [[Fred Phelps]] and his two daughters, [[Shirley Phelps-Roper]] and Rebecca Phelps-Davis, were found liable for invasion of privacy and intentional infliction of emotional distress. A federal jury awarded Snyder $2.9&amp;nbsp;million in compensatory damages, then later added a decision to award $6&amp;nbsp;million in punitive damages for invasion of privacy and an additional $2&amp;nbsp;million for causing emotional distress (a total of $10,900,000). The organization said it would not change its message because of the verdict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21566280/ &quot;Father wins millions from war funeral picketers&quot;], ''[[msnbc.com]]'', October 31, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSN3134225120071031 &quot;Kansas church liable in Marine funeral protest&quot;], ''[[Reuters]]'', October 31, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2007/US/10/31/funeral.protest/?iref=mpstoryview &quot;Church ordered to pay $10.9 million for funeral protest&quot;], ''[[CNN]]'', October 31, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

WBC said that it was thankful for the verdict,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.godhatesfags.com/written/fliers/archive/20071031_thank-god-for-verdict.pdf &quot;Thank God for the $10.9 Million Verdict!&quot;], Westboro Baptist Church, October 31, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; but also unsuccessfully sought a mistrial (based on alleged prejudicial statements made by the judge and violations of the [[gag order]] by the plaintiff's attorney)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=$11M damage award for picketing funeral|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003986773_funeral01.html|date=November 1, 2007|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|agency=[[McClatchy Newspapers]]; [[Associated Press]]|accessdate=April 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also filed an appeal.

On February 4, 2008, U.S. District Judge Richard D.

On September 24, 2009, a federal appeals court ruled in favor of Westboro Baptist Church and reversed the lower court's award. It found their picket near the funeral is protected speech because it involves &quot;matters of public concern, including the issues of homosexuals in the military, the sex-abuse scandal within the Catholic Church, and the political and moral conduct of the United States and its citizens&quot;, and did not violate the privacy of the service member's family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.military.com/news/article/court-says-gi-funeral-protests-legal.html?col=1186032310810 &quot;Court Says GI Funeral Protests Legal&quot;], ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'', September 25, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; On March 30, 2010, the appeals court ordered Albert Snyder to pay the church's court costs of over $16,000, a move that Snyder's attorney's referred to as &quot;adding insult to injury&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/carroll/bal-protest0329,0,3866909.story |title=Marine's father ordered to pay Westboro's court costs |work=[[The Baltimore Sun]] |date=March 29, 2010 |accessdate=April 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision has led to nationwide support for Snyder, with over 3,000 promises for donations to help offset the cost; [[Pundit (expert)|political commentator]] [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] offered to pay the entire amount of the costs on March 30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/2010/03/31/2010-03-31_bill_oreilly_helps_albert_snyder_after_weird_westboro_baptist_church_protests_hi.html |title=Support grows for dad of slain Marine told to pay Westboro Baptist Church, which cheered son's death |work=Daily News|date=March 31, 2010 |accessdate=April 5, 2010 | location=New York | first=Adam | last=Sommers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MCT&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/2010/04/marine_scotus_040510w/|title=Snyder-Phelps fight has many twists, turns|last=Lamothe|first=Dan|date=April 6, 2010|work=[[Marine Corps Times]]|accessdate=April 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American Legion has also raised $17,000 to help pay Snyder's court costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|title=Snyder donations exceed $17,000|url=http://www.legion.org/news/10641/snyder-donations-exceed-17000|date=April 5, 2010|publisher=[[American Legion]]|accessdate=April 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an 8–1 decision, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Phelps on March 2, 2011.

Justice [[Samuel Alito]], the lone dissenter, said Snyder wanted only to &quot;bury his son in peace&quot;. Instead, Alito said, the protesters &quot;brutally attacked&quot; Matthew Snyder to attract public attention. &quot;Our profound national commitment to free and open debate is not a license for the vicious verbal assault that occurred in this case,&quot; he said.

===Other legal responses===
On July 14, 2006, [[Mundy Township, Michigan]] billed the WBC for $5,000. The Westboro church had informed township authorities on June 28 that a protest was planned at the Swartz Funeral Home. The bill to the church ensued, according to the local police chief, because the congregation failed to keep a verbal contract for security. Fred Phelps' daughter claimed that the Holy Ghost had informed them not to fly to Michigan even though they had already purchased airline tickets. Security at the Webb funeral was high; 15 fire trucks were involved, as well as numerous police officers from nearby jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pridesource.com/article.shtml?article=19573 |title=Michigan town bills Phelps' church over protest no-show |publisher=Pridesource.com |date=July 20, 2006 |accessdate=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The township has now stated that it will not pursue the matter.

In 1999, inspired by the murder of Matthew Shepard the previous year, [[Michael Moore]] organized a protest against [[homophobia]] for his television show ''[[The Awful Truth (TV series)|The Awful Truth]]''. He toured states with [[anti-sodomy law]]s in the &quot;Sodomobile&quot;, a pink bus filled with gay men and women. At one point, they visited the Westboro Church compound and got out to meet Fred Phelps, at which time Moore introduced the Sodomobile to him.&lt;ref name=Schultz&gt;Schultz, Emily.

Two days after the September 11 attacks, a 19-year old man named Jared Dailey stood on the street corner facing the church holding up a plywood sign that said &quot;Not today, Fred&quot;.

On December 12, 2008, the group picketed a production of ''The Laramie Project'' at the Boston Center for the Arts. Local activists held a [[Phelps-A-Thon]] in response.

In March 2010, a Richmond Virginia ad-hoc group formed to create a counter protest to an upcoming Westboro Baptist Church visit protesting against Jewish and LGBT organizations.

The funds (approx. $14,000) were then donated to those same Jewish and LGBT organizations that WBC was protesting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc12.com/Global/story.asp?S=12066576|title=UPDATE: Protests and counter-protests planned|date=March 2, 2010|accessdate=March 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://motherjones.com/mojo/2010/08/turning-westboro-church-hate-charity-video-pennies-protest-virginia-god-fags|title=Turning Westboro Church's Hate Into Charity (VIDEO)|date=August 18, 2010|accessdate=March 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 11, 2010, the day of the funeral of [[Elizabeth Edwards]], a group called &quot;Line of Love&quot; planned to have about 200 protesters on the north side of West Edenton Street in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]] while 10 Westboro members picketed on the south side of the street, two blocks away from the funeral. While Westboro members who disagreed with Edwards' tolerance for gays were &quot;promoting awareness of the dangers of homosexuality&quot;, Line of Love had the goal of  &quot;promoting proper respect for funerals&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2010/12/11/855906/protest-sparks-its-own-protest.html|title=Westboro Baptist protest sparks its own protest|last=McDonald|first=Thomasi|work=[[News &amp; Observer]]|location=Raleigh, NC|date=December 11, 2010|accessdate=December 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 16, 2011, when Westboro members picketed a [[Foo Fighters]] concert in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], the band appeared on a truck float in front of the protesters. Dressed in homo-erotic outfits, they performed their country-parody song &quot;Keep It Clean&quot; – which contained many homosexual references and overtones – from their &quot;Hot Buns&quot; viral video; midway though the song, lead singer [[Dave Grohl]] made a speech calling for equality and tolerance.

===Actions by opponents===
During a picket in [[Seaford, Delaware]] on May 21, 2006, one person broke through police lines and assaulted WBC members who fled into a police van.

===Parodies===
{{anchor|God hates figs}}
A slogan commonly invoked at the counter protests is &quot;God hates figs&quot;. Parodying the WBC all-capitals &quot;God hates fags&quot; signs, the counter-protest signs often invoke a passage in the [[Bible|Biblical]] book of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] to justify the claim about God and his feelings about [[Common fig|fig]]s.  The signs have been noted at counter-protests at the University of Chicago;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Christman |first=Zach |url=http://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/Students-Counter-Protest-Westboro-Baptist-Church-at-University-of-Chicago-UIC-God-Hates-Figs-and-Shrimp.html |title=God Hates Figs (and Shrimp) |publisher=NBC Chicago |date=March 13, 2009 |accessdate=March 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Spartanburg, South Carolina;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goupstate.com/article/20110215/ARTICLES/102151024/1088/sports?Title=Kansas-church-a-no-show-at-Converse-but-film-draws-a-crowd |title=Westboro Baptist Church of Topeka, Kan., a no-show at Converse |publisher=GoUpstate.com |date=February 15, 2011 |accessdate=March 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Portsmouth, New Hampshire,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeanné McCartin |url=http://www.seacoastonline.com/articles/20110224-NEWS-102240415 |title=Hundreds speak out against hate in city |publisher=SeacoastOnline.com |accessdate=March 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as at the non-WBC-themed [[Rally to Restore Sanity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;huffingtonpost1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Kent Hayden |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kent-hayden-mdiv/the-religion-of-a-satiric_b_777097.html |title=The Religion of a Satirical Generation |work=The Huffington Post |date= November 7, 2010|accessdate=March 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the signs has been invoked as a sign of sanity by the ACLU&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aclu.org/2009/03/16/god-hates-figs |title=God Hates Figs |publisher=American Civil Liberties Union |accessdate=March 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others.&lt;ref name=&quot;huffingtonpost1&quot;/&gt;

These are genuine citations, but are not the sole mentions of [[figs in the Bible]].

Other sites and organizations have parodied the slogans of the Westboro Baptist Church, including God Hates Fred Phelps,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.godhatesfredphelps.com/ God Hates Fred Phelps]&lt;/ref&gt; God Hates Bags,&lt;ref&gt;[http://godhatesbags.com/ God Hates Bags]&lt;/ref&gt; and God Hates Shrimp.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.godhatesshrimp.com/ God Hates Shrimp]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cooper family in [[Kevin Smith]]'s 2011 film ''[[Red State (2011 film)|Red State]]'' was inspired by the Westboro Baptist Church and the Phelps.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Kevin. ''Tough Shit: Life Advice from a Fat, Lazy Slob Who Did Good'' (1592406890)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
A number of Phelps' critics have suggested that the actions of the Westboro Baptist Church are merely a ploy to receive attention and publicity above all else, though the Phelps themselves deny this claim. Counter-protesting against the group, they suggest, gives them attention and incentive that they do not deserve; and a more effective response against Phelps would be to ignore his family and congregation completely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/media/pdf/Responding-to-the-Westboro-Baptist-Church.pdf |title=Responding to the Westboro Baptist Church |publisher=[[Anti-Defamation League]] |accessdate=January 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/authorities-eye-kansas-hate-group-s-visit-to-li-1.1465453 |first=Bart|last=Jones |title=Authorities eye Kansas hate group's visit to LI |work=Newsday |date=September 21, 2009 |accessdate=January 30, 2010 }} (subscription required for full article)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modemac.com/wiki/Westboro_Baptist_Church|title=The High Weirdness Project: Westboro Baptist Church|accessdate=December 2, 2006|date=November 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; WBC, through the closely related Phelps Chartered law firm, has collected fees under the [[Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Award Act of 1976]] when their protests have been unlawfully disrupted.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.archive.org/web/20060118030042/http://www.godhatesfags.com/fliers/jan2006/20060114_pandering-demagogic-legislatures.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, [[Sundance Channel (United States)|Sundance Channel]] aired the film ''[[A Union in Wait]]'', a documentary about [[same-sex marriage]] directed by [[Ryan Butler]]. Phelps and members of Westboro Baptist Church appeared in the film after Phelps picketed [[Wake Forest Baptist Church]] at [[Wake Forest University]] over a proposed same-sex union ceremony.

In 2005, the British satellite company [[British Sky Broadcasting]] produced an [[investigative journalism|investigative]] piece using [[hidden camera]]s, which included footage of two of Phelps' granddaughters, Libby and Jael.&lt;ref name=&quot;sky-video&quot;&gt;[http://www.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,91136-1200311,00.html &quot;Inside The Church Of Hate&quot;], [[Sky News]], October 25, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In the testimonial, Libby and Jael explain that they hope and pray that no one outside of Westboro becomes &quot;elect&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;sky-video&quot;/&gt; because they want everyone else in the world to die horribly and burn in Hell,&lt;ref name=&quot;sky-video&quot;/&gt; and that even if they did not believe their actions were dictated by God, they would still do and enjoy them anyway.&lt;ref name=&quot;sky-video&quot;/&gt; The interview was not part of the hidden camera segment, and although much of the footage was taken without the knowledge or permission of Westboro, the church maintains a link to the entire report on its website.

On April 1, 2007, the British television channel [[BBC Two]] broadcast [[Louis Theroux]]' ''[[The Most Hated Family in America]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Theroux, Louis.

The website godhatesfags.com was prominently featured in ''[[The Jeremy Kyle Show]]'', a talk show aired on the [[ITV]] network in the United Kingdom on June 5, 2007. Church members Shirley and her daughters had been invited to express their beliefs live via satellite. On the show, Kyle criticized the Phelps for their beliefs and referred to the Phelps' children as &quot;completely and utterly [[Mind control|brainwashed]]&quot; and to Shirley herself as &quot;[[Psychosis|deranged]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LGF on Jeremy Kyle|url=http://www.lgf.org.uk/news/video-lgf-on-jeremy-kyle/|publisher=[[The Lesbian &amp; Gay Foundation]]|accessdate=January 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jeremy Kyle|url=http://www.godhatesthemedia.com/tvradio/jeremykyle.html|work=God Hates The Media|publisher=Westboro Baptist Church|accessdate=January 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
