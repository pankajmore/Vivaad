{{Discrimination sidebar}}
'''Discrimination''' is the [[prejudice|prejudicial]] or distinguishing treatment of an individual based on his or her membership - or perceived membership - in a certain group or category. It involves the group's initial reaction or interaction, influencing the individual's actual behavior towards the group or the group leader, restricting members of one group from opportunities or privileges that are available to another group, leading to the exclusion of the individual or entities based on logical or irrational decision making.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to sociology. 7th ed. New York: [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]] Inc, 2009. page 334. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Discriminatory traditions, policies, ideas, practices, and laws exist in many countries and [[institution]]s in every part of the world. In some places, controversial attempts such as [[racial quotas]] have been used to redress negative effects of discrimination—but have sometimes been called [[reverse discrimination]] themselves.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;discrimination&quot; began to be used as an expression of derogatory racial prejudice in the 1830s from [[Thomas D. Rice]]'s performances as &quot;Jim Crow&quot;.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} Since the [[American Civil War]] the term &quot;discrimination&quot; generally evolved in [[American English]] usage as an understanding of prejudicial treatment of an individual based solely on their race, later generalized as membership in a certain socially undesirable [[Social group|group]] or social category.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to sociology. 7th ed. New York: [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]] Inc, 2009. page 324. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  &quot;Discrimination&quot; derives from Latin, where the verb ''discrimire' means &quot;to separate, to distinguish, to make a distinction&quot;.

==Definitions==
Moral philosophers have defined discrimination as ''disadvantageous'' treatment or consideration. This is a comparative definition. An individual need not be actually harmed in order to be discriminated against. He or she just needs to be treated ''worse'' than others for some arbitrary reason. If someone decides to donate to help orphan children, but decides to donate less, say, to black children out of a racist attitude, he or she will be acting in a discriminatory way even the people he discriminates against are actually benefitted by having some money donated to them.&lt;ref&gt;Kasper Lippert-Rasmussen, “Private Discrimination: A Prioritarian, Desert-Accommodating Account”, ''San Diego Law Review'', 43, 817-856 (2006); Oscar Horta, “Discrimination in Terms of Moral Exclusion”, ''Theoria: Swedish Journal of Philosophy'', 76, 346-364 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on realistic-conflict theory&lt;ref&gt;Sherif, M. (1967). ''Group conflict and co-operation.'' London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; and social-identity theory,&lt;ref&gt;Tajfel, H., &amp; Turner, J. C. (1979). An integrative theory of intergroup conflict. In W. G. Austin &amp; S. Worchel (Eds.), ''The social psychology of intergroup relations'' (pp. 33–47). Monterey, CA: Brooks/Cole.&lt;/ref&gt; Rubin and Hewstone&lt;ref&gt;14.	Rubin, M., &amp; Hewstone, M. (2004). Social identity, system justification, and social dominance: Commentary on Reicher, Jost et al., and Sidanius et al. ''Political Psychology, 25'', 823-844.&lt;/ref&gt; have highlighted a distinction among three types of discrimination:
#''Realistic competition'' is driven by self-interest and is aimed at obtaining material resources (e.g., food, territory, customers) for the in-group (e.g., favouring an in-group in order to obtain more resources for its members, including the self).
#''Social competition'' is driven by the need for self-esteem and is aimed at achieving a positive social status for the in-group relative to comparable out-groups (e.g., favouring an in-group in order to make it better than an out-group).
#''Consensual discrimination'' is driven by the need for accuracy{{clarify|date=February 2012}} and reflects stable and legitimate intergroup status hierarchies (e.g., favouring a high-status in-group because it is high status).

The [[United Nations]] stance on discrimination includes the  statement:  &quot;Discriminatory behaviors take many forms, but they all involve some form of exclusion or rejection.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{PDF|[http://cyberschoolbus.un.org/discrim/id_8_ud_print.asp United Nations CyberSchoolBus: What is discrimination?]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Racial and ethnic discrimination==

[[Image:Segregation 1938b.jpg|right|thumb|250px|An [[African-American]] child at a segregated drinking fountain on a courthouse lawn, [[North Carolina]], 1938.]]

Racial discrimination differentiates individuals on the basis of real and perceived racial differences and has been official government policy in several countries, such as [[Papua New Guinea]] in the [[apartheid]] era.

In the [[United States]], [[racial profiling]] of minorities by law-enforcement officials has been called racial discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1866, the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866|Civil Rights Act]] provided a remedy for intentional race discrimination in employment by private employers and state and local public employers.

The [[Civil Rights Act of 1871]] applies to public employment or employment involving state action prohibiting deprivation of rights secured by the federal constitution or federal laws through action under color of law. Title VII is the principal federal statute with regard to employment discrimination prohibiting unlawful employment discrimination by public and private employers, labor organizations, training programs and employment agencies based on race or color, religion, gender, and national origin.
[[Image:DurbanSign1989.jpg|left|200px|thumb|A racist sign on a beach in Durban under the South African apartheid laws (1989)]]
Title VII also prohibits retaliation against any person for opposing any practice forbidden by statute, or for making a charge, testifying, assisting, or participating in a proceeding under the statute. The [[Civil Rights Act of 1991]] expanded the damages available in Title VII cases and granted Title VII plaintiffs the right to a jury trial. Title VII also provides that race and color discrimination against every race and color is prohibited.

Within the criminal justice system in some Western countries, minorities are convicted and imprisoned disproportionately when compared with whites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publiceye.org/defendingjustice/pdfs/factsheets/10-Fact%20Sheet%20-%20System%20as%20Racist.pdf How is the Criminal Justice System Racist?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2008/06/05/us-prison-numbers-hit-new-high Blacks Hardest Hit by Incarceration Policy]. Human Rights Watch. June 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, nearly one out of three black men between the ages of 20-29 were in prison or jail, on probation or parole on any given day in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eji.org/race%20crim%20just.pdf Race and the Criminal Justice System]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] make up about 2% of [[Canada]]'s population, but account for 18% of the federal prison population as of 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.csc-scc.gc.ca/text/rsrch/reports/r144/r144_e.shtml| title=A Profile of Visible Minority Offenders in the Federal Canadian Correctional System| author=Trevethan, Shelley| coauthors=Rastin, Christopher J.| publisher=Research Branch, Correctional Service of Canada| month=June| year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Australian government's June 2006 publication of prison statistics, [[Indigenous Australians|Aborigines]] make up 24% of the overall prison population in [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/4517.0Main+Features12006?OpenDocument| title=Prisoners in Australia, 2006| publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics| date=2006-12-14| accessdate=2007-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, [[Māori people|Māori]] made up just 15% of the total population of [[New Zealand]] but 49.5% of prisoners. Māori were entering prison at 8 times the rate of non-Māori.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2004/41654.htm New Zealand's Prison Population]&lt;/ref&gt; A quarter of the people in [[England]]'s prisons are from an ethnic minority. The [[Equality and Human Rights Commission]] found that five times more black people than white people per head of population in England and Wales are imprisoned. Experts and politicians said over-representation of black men was a result of decades of racial prejudice in the criminal justice system.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2010/oct/11/black-prison-population-increase-england More black people jailed in England and Wales proportionally than in US]&quot;. The Guardian. October 11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discrimination on the basis of nationality==

Discrimination on the basis of [[nationality]] is usually included in employment laws&lt;ref&gt;[http://dwd.wisconsin.gov/er/discrimination_civil_rights/publication_erd_14009_pweb.htm Race, Color, National Origin and Ancestry], State of Wisconsin&lt;/ref&gt; (see below [[Discrimination#Employment discrimination|section for employment discrimination]] specifically). It is sometimes referred to as bound together with racial discrimination&lt;ref name=&quot;KenLaMance&quot;&gt;Ken LaMance, [http://www.legalmatch.com/law-library/article/race-or-nationality-discrimination.html Prohibitions Against Race and Nationality]&lt;/ref&gt; although it can be separate. It may vary from laws that stop refusals of hiring based on nationality, asking questions regarding origin, to prohibitions of firing, forced retirement, compensation and pay, etc., based on nationality.&lt;ref name=&quot;KenLaMance&quot;/&gt;

Discrimination on the basis of nationality may show as a &quot;level of acceptance&quot; in a sport or work team regarding new team members and employees who differ from the nationality of the majority of team members.&lt;ref&gt;Christiane Schwieren, [http://sgr.sagepub.com/content/39/6/643.abstract Mechanisms Underlying Nationality-Based Discrimination in Teams. A Quasi-Experiment Testing Predictions From Social Psychology and Microeconomics], Maastricht University&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sex, gender, and gender-identity discrimination==
{{Main|Sexism}}

Though gender discrimination and sexism refers to beliefs and [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] in relation to the [[gender]] of a person, such beliefs and attitudes are of a social nature and do not, normally, carry any legal consequences. '''Sex discrimination''', on the other hand, may have legal consequences.

Though what constitutes sex discrimination varies between countries, the essence is that it is an adverse action taken by one person against another person that would not have occurred had the person been of another sex. Discrimination of that nature is considered a form of [[prejudice]] and in certain enumerated circumstances is illegal in many countries.

Sexual discrimination can arise in different contexts. For instance an employee may be discriminated against by being asked discriminatory questions during a job interview, or by an [[employer]] not hiring or promoting, unequally paying, or wrongfully terminating, an employee based on her (or his) gender.
[[File:US gender pay gap, by sex, race-ethnicity.001.png|thumb|330px|Median weekly earnings of full-time wage and salary workers, by sex, race, and ethnicity, U.S., 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;bls 2009&quot;&gt;U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. [http://www.bls.gov/cps/cpswom2009.pdf ''Highlights of Women’s Earnings in 2009.''] Report 1025, June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In an educational setting there could be claims that a student was excluded from an educational institution, program, opportunity, loan, student group, or scholarship because of her (or his) gender. In the housing setting there could be claims that a person was refused negotiations on seeking a house, contracting/leasing a house or getting a loan based on his or her gender. Another setting where there have been claims of gender discrimination is banking; for example if one is refused credit or is offered unequal loan terms based on one’s gender.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, F. (2003) Organizational Behaviour and Gender (2nd Edition), Aldershot: Ashgate.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another setting where there is usually gender discrimination is when one is refused to extend his or her credit, refused approval of credit/loan process, and if there is a burden of unequal loan terms based on one’s gender.

Socially, sexual differences have been used to justify [[gender role|different roles for men and women]], in some cases giving rise to claims of primary and secondary roles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalcommons.shu.ac.uk/ciod_papers/54/ Ridley-Duff, R. J. (2008) &quot;Gendering, Courtship and Pay Equity: Developing Attraction Theory to Understand Work-Life Balance and Entrepreneurial Behaviour&quot;, paper to the ''31st ISBE Conference'', 5th–7th November, Belfast]&lt;/ref&gt;

While there are alleged non-physical differences between men and women, major reviews of the academic literature on gender difference find only a tiny minority of characteristics where there are consistent psychological differences between men and women, and these relate directly to experiences grounded in biological difference.&lt;ref&gt;Hyde, J. S. (2005) “The Gender Similarities Hypothesis”, ''American Psychologist'', 60(6): 581–592.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are also some psychological differences in regard to how problems are dealt with and emotional perceptions and reactions that may relate to hormones and the successful characteristics of each gender during longstanding roles in past primitive lifestyles.

Unfair discrimination usually follows the [[sexism|gender stereotyping]] held by a society.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond F. Gregory, ''Women and Workplace Discrimination: Overcoming Barriers to Gender Equality,'' Piscataway, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations]] had concluded that women often experience a &quot;[[glass ceiling]]&quot; and that there are no societies in which women enjoy the same opportunities as men.&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Fuchs Epstein, ''Glass Ceilings and Open Doors,'' Fordham Law Review,  64.2, 1995, pp.291-449; Carol Hymowitz and Timothy Schellhardt, ''The Glass Ceiling: Why Women Can’t Seem to Break the Invisible Barrier that Blocks them from the Top Jobs,'' The Wall Street Journal, 4, March 24, 1986, pp.10-40&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;glass ceiling&quot; is used to describe a perceived barrier to advancement in employment based on discrimination, especially sex discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Bolton, Joe R. Feagin ''Black in Blue: African-American Police Officers and Racism,'' Routledge, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]] in 1995, the Glass Ceiling Commission, a government-funded group, stated: &quot;Over half of all Master’s degrees are now awarded to women, yet 95% of senior-level managers, of the top Fortune 1000 industrial and 500 service companies are men. Of them, 97% are white.&quot; In its report, it recommended [[affirmative action]], which is the consideration of an employee's gender and race in hiring and promotion decisions, as a means to end this form of discrimination.&lt;ref name=&quot;Glass Ceiling Commission&quot;&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2008-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, women accounted for 51% of all workers in the high-paying management, professional, and related occupations. They outnumbered men in such occupations as public relations managers; financial managers; and human resource managers.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.dol.gov/wb/stats/main.htm Quick Stats on Women Workers, 2008]&quot;. [[U.S. Department of Labor]], [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]], ''Employment and Earnings, 2008 Annual Averages and the Monthly Labor Review''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[People's Republic of China|China]]'s leading headhunter, Chinahr.com, reported in 2007 that the average salary for white-collar men was 44,000 yuan ($6,441), compared with 28,700 yuan ($4,201) for women.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.newsweek.com/id/209954/page/1 A Great Leap Backward for China's Women]&quot;. [[Newsweek]]. August 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The PwC research found that among FTSE 350 companies in the [[United Kingdom]] in 2002 almost 40% of senior management posts were occupied by women. When that research was repeated in 2007, the number of senior management posts held by women had fallen to 22%.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2007/mar/08/business.workingparents Women quit before hitting glass ceiling]&quot;. Guardian.co.uk. March 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Transgender]] individuals, both male to female and female to male, often experience [[transphobia|transphobic]] problems that often lead to dismissals, underachievement, difficulty in finding a job, social isolation, and, occasionally, violent attacks against them. Nevertheless, the problem of gender discrimination does not stop at transgender individuals or with women. Men are often the victim in certain areas of employment as men begin to seek work in office and childcare settings traditionally perceived as &quot;women's jobs&quot;. One such situation seems to be evident in a recent case concerning alleged YMCA discrimination and a Federal Court Case in Texas.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}&lt;!-- could not find previously cited story:http://www.nowpublic.com/world/blacks-men-are-racial-gender-discrimination-not-dead-yet --&gt; The case actually involves alleged discrimination against both men and blacks in childcare, even when they pass the same strict background tests and other standards of employment. It is currently being contended in federal court, as of fall 2009.

Discrimination in slasher films is relevant.  Gloria Cowan had a research group study on 57 different slasher films. Their results showed that the non-surviving females were more frequently sexual than the surviving females and the non-surviving males. Surviving as a female slasher victim was strongly associated with the absence of sexual behavior. In slasher films, the message appears to be that sexual women get killed and only the pure women survive. Slasher films reinforce the idea that female sexuality can be costly.&lt;ref name=Cowan&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cowan|first=Glora|coauthors=O'Brien, Margaret|title=Gender and Survival vs. Death in Slasher Films: A Content Analysis|journal=Sex Roles|year=1990|volume=23|pages=187–196|doi=10.1007/BF00289865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual orientation discrimination==

{{See also|Heterosexism|Heteronormativity|Homophobia}}
One’s sexual orientation is a “predilection for homosexuality, heterosexuality, or bisexuality”.&lt;ref&gt;World English Dictionary, [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/sexual+orientation] “Sexual Orientation]&lt;/ref&gt; Like most minority groups, homosexuals and bisexuals are not immune to prejudice and discrimination from the majority group. They may experience hatred from others because of their sexual preferences; a term for such hatred based upon one’s sexual orientation is often called [[homophobia]]. Many continue to hold negative feelings towards those with non-heterosexual orientations and will discriminate against people who have them or are thought to have them. 

In 2009, [[ILGA]] published a report based on research carried out by Daniel Ottosson at Södertörn University College, Stockholm, Sweden.

{{further|LGBT rights by country or territory}}
A number of countries, especially those in the [[Western world]], have passed measures to alleviate discrimination against sexual minorities, including laws against anti-gay hate crimes and workplace discrimination. Some have also legalized same-sex marriage or civil unions in order to grant same-sex couples the same protections and benefits as opposite-sex couples. In 2011, the [[United Nations]] passed its first resolution recognizing LGBT rights.

==Religious discrimination==
{{Main|Religious discrimination}}

{{Status of religious freedom}}
Religious discrimination is valuing or treating a person or group differently because of what they do or do not believe or because of their feelings towards a given religion. For instance, the indigenous Christian population of [[Balkans]] (known as &quot;rayah&quot; or &quot;protected flock&quot;) lived under the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Kanun–i–Rayah. The word is sometimes translated as 'cattle' rather than 'flock' or 'subjects' to emphasize the inferior status of the rayah.&lt;ref&gt;Maan Z. Madina, ''Arabic-English Dictionary of the Modern Literary Language'', 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

Restrictions upon [[Jew]]ish occupations were imposed by Christian authorities. Local rulers and church officials closed many professions to Jews, pushing them into marginal roles considered socially inferior, such as tax and rent collecting and [[moneylending]], occupations only tolerated as a &quot;necessary evil&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/07/0718_050718_ashkenazim.html Did Discrimination Enhance Intelligence of Jews?]&quot;. National Geographic News. July 18, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The number of Jews permitted to reside in different places was limited; they were concentrated in [[ghetto]]s and were not allowed to own land. 

In a 1979 consultation on the issue, the United States commission on civil rights defined religious discrimination in relation to the civil rights guaranteed by the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. Whereas religious civil liberties, such as the right to hold or not to hold a religious belief, are essential for [[Freedom of Religion]] (in the United States secured by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]), religious discrimination occurs when someone is denied &quot; the equal protection of the laws, equality of status under the law, equal treatment in the administration of justice, and equality of opportunity and access to employment, education, housing, public services and facilities, and public accommodation because of their exercise of their right to religious freedom.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, 1979: ''Religious discrimination. A neglected issue. A consultation sponsored by the United States Commission on Civil Rights, Washington D.C., April 9–10, 1979''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disability discrimination==
{{Main|Disability discrimination}}

Discrimination against people with disabilities in favor of people who are not is called [[ableism]] or [[disablism]].{{by whom|date=January 2012}}{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}  Disability discrimination, which treats non-disabled individuals as the standard of ‘normal living’, results in public and private places and services, education, and social work that are built to serve 'standard' people, thereby excluding those with various disabilities.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In the United States, the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] mandates the provision of equality of access to both buildings and services and is paralleled by similar acts in other countries, such as the [[Equality Act 2010]] in the UK.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==Language discrimination==
{{refimprove|date=January 2012}}
{{Main|Linguistic discrimination}}
Diversity of language is protected and respected by most nations who value cultural diversity.{{dubious|date=January 2012}} However, people are sometimes subjected to different treatment because their preferred language is associated with a particular group, class or category. Commonly, the preferred language is just another attribute of separate [[ethnic group]]s.{{dubious|date=January 2012}} Discrimination exists if there is prejudicial treatment against a person or a group of people who speak a particular language or dialect.

Language discrimination is suggested to be labeled '''[[linguicism]]''' or '''logocism'''{{by whom|date=January 2012}}  Anti-discriminatory and inclusive efforts to accommodate persons who speak different languages or cannot have fluency in the country's predominant or &quot;official&quot; language, is [[bilingualism]] such as official documents in two languages, and [[multiculturalism]] in more than two languages.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==Employment discrimination==
[[Image:Demonstration-6.11.06.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ethiopian Jews]] protest in Israel over non-employment of Ethiopian academics.]]
{{Main|Employment discrimination}}
Denying someone employment, or disallowing one from applying for a job, is recognized as employment discrimination when the grounds for such an exclusion is not related to the requirements of the position, including such elements as race, age, gender, religion, height, weight, nationality, disability, sexual orientation, and gender identity.

The United States federal laws that protect against:
* Race, color and national origin discrimination include the [http://www.finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21 Civil Rights Act of 1964], [http://www.finduslaw.com/executive_order_number_11478_equal_employment_opportunity_in_the_federal_government Executive Order Number 11478] among other numerous laws that protect people from [http://www.finduslaw.com/employment_discrimination/race_national_origin race, color and national origin discrimination].

Most other western nations have similar laws protecting these groups.

==Reverse discrimination==
{{Main|Reverse discrimination}}
[[File:Protesto contra o sistema de cotas.jpg|thumb|upright|Students protesting against [[racial quota]]s in Brazil: &quot;''Quer uma vaga? Passe no  vestibular!''&quot; (&quot;Do you want a university place? Be successful in the entrance exam!&quot;)]]
Some attempts at antidiscrimination have been criticized as '''reverse discrimination'''. In particular, minority quotas (for example, [[affirmative action]]) discriminate against members of a dominant or majority group. In its opposition to race preferences, the American Civil Rights Institute's [[Ward Connerly]] stated, &quot;There is nothing positive, affirmative, or equal about 'affirmative action' programs that give preference to some groups based on race.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acri.org/pr_7_25_07.html American Civil Rights Institute | Press Release&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; There are cases, however, such as the Noack v. YMCA case in U.S. Fifth Circuit Court, which include outright anti-male gender bias in a traditionally female work environment like childcare. That former employee claims to have suffered even physical assaults, and was allegedly also told to not hire too many blacks or men.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==Theories==

===Discrimination===
[[Social theories]] such as [[Egalitarianism]] claim that [[social equality]] should prevail. In some societies, including most developed countries, each individual's civil rights include the right to be free from government sponsored social discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.weblocator.com/attorney/mn/law/concivrig.html#30 |title=Civil rights |accessdate=2006 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Due to a belief in the capacity to perceive pain and/or suffering shared by all animals, '[[abolitionist]]' or '[[vegan]]' egalitarianism maintains that the interests of every individual (regardless its species), warrant [[equal consideration of interests|equal consideration]] with the interests of humans, and that not doing so is &quot;[[speciesism|speciesist]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;singerethics-sentience&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Practical Ethics]] |last=Singer |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Singer |origyear=1993 |year=1999 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-43971-X |edition=Second |pages=57&amp;ndash;58 |chapter=Equality for Animals? |quote=If a being suffers, there can be no moral justification for refusing to take that suffering into consideration. &amp;hellip; This is why the limit of sentience&amp;hellip;is the only defensible boundary of concern for the interests of others. &amp;hellip; Similarly those I would call 'speciesists' give greater weight to their own species when there is a clash between their interests and the interests of those of other species. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conservative and anarcho-capitalist===
In contrast, [[conservatism|conservative]] writer and law professor [[Matthias Storme]] has claimed that the freedom of discrimination in human societies is a fundamental human right, or more precisely, the basis of all fundamental freedoms and therefore the most fundamental freedom. Author [[Hans-Hermann Hoppe]], in an essay&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lewrockwell.com/hoppe/hoppe4.html Lewrockwell.com], {{cite web |last=Hoppe |first=Hans-Hermann |year=2001 |url=http://www.lewrockwell.com/hoppe/hoppe4.html |title=Democracy: The God That Failed |accessdate=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; about his book [[Democracy: The God That Failed]], asserts that a natural social order is characterized by increased discrimination.
The views of the two aforementioned do not, of course, represent all people who either call themselves &quot;conservative&quot; or are so-called, for example, economist [[Thomas Sowell]],who is &quot;conservative&quot;, expounds no such radical or extreme sentiments.

===Labeling theory===
Discrimination, in [[labeling theory]], takes form as mental categorization of minorities and the use of [[stereotype]]. This theory describes difference as deviance from the norm, which results in internal devaluation and [[social stigma]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Slattery| first=M. | year=2002 | title=Key Ideas in Sociology | publisher=Nelson Thornes| isbn=978-0-7487-6565-2 | pages=134–137}}&lt;/ref&gt; that may be seen as discrimination. It is started by describing a 'natural' social order. It is distinguished between the fundamental principle of fascism and social democracy. The [[Nazis]] in 1930's-era Germany, the pre-1990 [[Apartheid]] government of South Africa used racial discriminatory agendas for their political ends. This practice continues with some present day governments.

==State discrimination vs. free market discrimination==
{{Tone|date=December 2011}}

===State discrimination===
In politics, the dominating part of the population rules. Therefore, the worst discrimination in the history has been committed by states. For example, the [[anti-semitic]] practices of the [[Nazi-Germany]] would not have happened in [[free market]]s, because they would have caused losses.&lt;ref name=murphy&gt;[http://www.econlib.org/library/Columns/y2010/Murphydiscrimination.html The Economics of Discrimination], Robert P. Murphy, Library of Economics, AUGUST 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

However, government officials and politicians need not care about losses as much as companies, which decreases their incentive not to discriminate. For example, around 1900 African-Americans started to compete for jobs that had previously been all-white. Officials, voted in by white majorities, changed the hiring rules for the federal civil service. Photographs of applicants were made obligatory in civil service job applications, and hiring officials were given discretion to choose between the three top scoring applicants. The number of blacks in federal employment was kept artificially low for decades.&lt;ref name=enc&gt;[http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/Discrimination.html Discrimination], The Concise Encyclopedia of Economics, Library of Economics&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 20th century South Africa mine owners preferred hiring black workers because they were cheaper. Then the whites successfully persuaded the government to enact laws that highly restricted the black's rights to work (see [[Apartheid]]).&lt;ref name=enc/&gt;

Similarly, to make more profits, producers secretly hired screenwriters who were on Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]]'s blacklist, which mitigated the effects of the list.&lt;ref name=enc/&gt;

When the &quot;Jim Crow&quot; racial segregation laws were enacted in the U.S., many companies disobeyed them for years, because the market automatically punishes companies that discriminate: they lose customers and get additional expenses. It took 15 years for the government to break down the resistance of the companies.&lt;ref name=roback&gt;Jennifer Roback, “The Political Economy of Segregation: The Case of Segregated Streetcars.” Journal of Economic History 56, no. 4 (December 1986): 893–917.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Markets punish the discriminator===
The Nobel prize winning economist [[Gary Becker]] showed in his book ''The Economics of Discrimination'' (University of Chicago Press, 1957) how the markets automatically punish the companies that discriminate.&lt;ref name=murphy/&gt;

The profitability of the company that discriminates is decreased, and the loss is &quot;directly proportional to how much the employer's decision was based on prejudice, rather than on merit.&quot; Indeed, choosing a worker with lower performance (in comparison to salary) causes losses proportional to the difference in performance. Similarly, the customers who discriminate against certain kinds of workers in favor of less effective ones have to pay more for their services, on average.&lt;ref name=murphy/&gt;

If a company discriminates, it typically loses profitability and market share to the companies that do not discriminate, unless the state limits free competition protecting the discriminators.&lt;ref name=enc/&gt;

==Scapegoats==
{{Tone|date=January 2012}}
Many people blame scapegoats for problems that are not their fault. This is common when two deprived ethnic groups compete with one another for economic rewards. This is normally directed against groups that are relatively powerless, because they make an easy target. It frequently involves projection, which is the unconscious attribution to the others of ones own desires or characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to sociology. 7th ed. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company Inc, 2009. Page 324. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
