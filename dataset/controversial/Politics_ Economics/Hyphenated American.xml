In the [[United States]], the term '''hyphenated American''' is an [[epithet]] commonly used from 1890 to 1920 to disparage Americans who were of foreign birth or origin, and who displayed an allegiance to a foreign country. It was most commonly used to disparage [[German Americans]] or [[Irish American]]s ([[Catholic]]s) who called for U.S. neutrality in [[World War I]]. Former President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] was an outspoken anti-hyphenate and [[Woodrow Wilson]] followed suit.&lt;ref&gt;John Higham, ''Strangers in the Land: Patterns of American Nativism, 1860-1925'' (1955) [http://books.google.com/books?id=UzVhOx7WuMMC&amp;pg=PA198&amp;dq=%22hyphenated+american%22+woodrow+OR+roosevelt&amp;lr=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=ACfU3U2lONAqRC_6z3xwprD89lyM9bFDDw online text p 198]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term &quot;hyphenated American&quot; was published by 1889,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | journal = The Deseret Weekly | title = Letter from 'Junius' | author = Charles William Penrose | volume = 39 | issue = 2 | publisher = Deseret News Co | pages = 53–54 | date = July 6, 1889 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=FawUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA54&amp;dq=%22hyphenated+american%22+date:0-1893 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was common as a derogatory term by 1904. During World War I the issue arose of the primary political loyalty of ethnic groups with close ties to Europe, especially German Americans and also Irish Americans. Former President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in speaking to the largely Irish Catholic [[Knights of Columbus]] at [[Carnegie Hall]] on Columbus Day 1915, asserted that,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9901E0DD1239E333A25750C1A9669D946496D6CF |title=Roosevelt Bars the Hyphenated |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=October 13, 1915 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|There is no room in this country for hyphenated Americanism. When I refer to hyphenated Americans, I do not refer to naturalized Americans. Some of the very best Americans I have ever known were naturalized Americans, Americans born abroad. But a hyphenated American is not an American at all... The one absolutely certain way of bringing this nation to ruin, of preventing all possibility of its continuing to be a nation at all, would be to permit it to become a tangle of squabbling nationalities, an intricate knot of German-Americans, Irish-Americans, English-Americans, French-Americans, Scandinavian-Americans or Italian-Americans, each preserving its separate nationality, each at heart feeling more sympathy with Europeans of that nationality, than with the other citizens of the American Republic... There is no such thing as a hyphenated American who is a good American. The only man who is a good American is the man who is an American and nothing else.}}

President [[Woodrow Wilson]] regarded &quot;hyphenated Americans&quot; with suspicion, saying, &quot;Any man who carries a hyphen about with him carries a dagger that he is ready to plunge into the vitals of this Republic whenever he gets ready.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/wilsonleagueofnations.htm ''Woodrow Wilson: Final Address in Support of the League of Nations''], americanrhetoric.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor-last=Di Nunzio |editor-first=Mario R. |title=Woodrow Wilson: Essential Writings and Speeches of the Scholar-President |publisher=NYU Press |year=2006 |isbn=0-8147-1984-8 |url=http://books.google.com.ph/books?id=qP2eeyB3QkYC&amp;pg=PA412&amp;lpg=PA412 |page=412 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=950DE1DC123AE03ABC4F51DFBF668382609EDE |title=Explains our Voting Power in the League |newspaper=New York Times |date=September 27, 1919 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
Modern style guides{{Which?|date=October 2010}} most often recommend dropping the hyphen between the two names except when the compound is used as an adjective; some recommend dropping the hyphen even for the adjective form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

 |title=Editorial Style Guide
|publisher=California State University at Los Angeles
|accessdate=2007-12-13 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080626130831/http://www.calstatela.edu/style/editfullguide.htm |archivedate = 2008-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, compounds with name fragments, such as ''Afro-American'' and ''Indo-European'', are recommended to be hyphenated.

===In American English===
The first term typically indicates a region or culture of origin [[ancestry]] paired with &quot;American&quot;.
Examples:
* Continent, region or [[Race (classification of humans)|race]]: [[African American]], [[Arab American]], [[Asian American]], [[European American]], [[Latino American]], [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]].
* Country/ethnicity or nationality: [[Chinese American]], [[English American]], [[Filipino American]], [[German American]], [[Greek American]], [[Irish American]], [[Indian American]], [[Italian American]], [[Japanese American]], [[American Jews|Jewish American]], [[Korean American]], [[Mexican American]], [[Norwegian American]], [[Armenian American]], [[Polish American]], [[Russian American]], [[Scottish American]], [[Spanish American]], [[Swedish American]], [[Ukrainian American]], [[Vietnamese American]] and so on.

The hyphen is employed when the compound term is used as an adjective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Falcon Style Guide: A Comprehensive Guide for Travel and Outdoor Writers and Editors | author = Erica S. Olsen | publisher = Globe Pequot | year = 2000 | isbn = 1-58592-005-3 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=UP1oopO3mcUC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=hyphen+adjective+mexican-american }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence, correct forms include ''an African American'' and ''an African-American man''.

The [[linguistics|linguistic]] construction functionally indicates [[ancestry]], but also may connote a sense that these individuals straddle two worlds&amp;mdash;one experience is specific to their unique [[ethnicity|ethnic]] [[cultural identity|identity]], while the other is the broader multicultural amalgam that is [[Americana]].

===In relation to Latin America===
{{main|American (word)}}
[[Latin America]] includes most of the [[Western Hemisphere]] south of the United States, including [[Mexico]], [[Central America]], [[South America]] and (in some cases) the [[Caribbean]]. U.S. nationals with origins in Latin America are often referred to as [[Hispanics in the United States|Hispanic or Latino Americans]], or by their specific country of origin, e.g. Mexican Americans, [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Ricans]] and [[Cuban Americans]].

==Hyphenated-American identities==
{{See also|Identity politics|Social solidarity|Social cohesion}}
Some groups recommend dropping the hyphen because it implies to some people dual nationalism and inability to be accepted as truly American. The [[Japanese American Citizens League]] is supportive of dropping the hyphen because the non-hyphenated form uses their ancestral origin as an adjective for &quot;American.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvtxt|Strasheim|1975}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, other groups have embraced the hyphen, arguing that the American identity is compatible with alternative identities and that the mixture of identities within the United States [[melting pot|strengthens the nation]] rather than weakens it.

'[[European American]],' as opposed to White, [[Whites|Caucasian]], has been coined in response to the increasing racial and ethnic [[Multiculturalism|diversity]] of the U.S., as well as to this diversity moving more into the mainstream of the society in the latter half of the 20th century.  The term distinguishes whites of European ancestry from those of other ancestries. In 1977, it was proposed that the term &quot;European American&quot; replace &quot;white&quot; as a racial label in the U.S. Census, although this was not done. The term &quot;European American&quot; is not in popular use in the U.S. among the general public or in the mass media, and the terms &quot;white&quot; or &quot;white American&quot; are commonly used instead.
