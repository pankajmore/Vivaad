'''Genocide denial''' is an attempt to deny or minimize the scale and severity of an incidence of genocide. The most well-known type is [[Holocaust denial]].

Where there is near universal agreement that a genocide occurred, genocide denial is usually considered a form of illegitimate [[historical revisionism (negationism)|historical revisionism]]. However, in circumstances where the event in dispute is not seen to constitute genocide by the facts, the use of the term may be an ''[[ad hominem]]'' by those who argue that a genocide occurred.

The extremely serious nature of the crime of genocide, along with the terrible reputation it creates, and potential repercussions that may come against a nation as a result of committing it, ensures that whenever genocide is charged, there will be parties that attempt to avoid or divert blame.&lt;ref name=CT-2007/&gt; However as Larissa van den Herik has pointed out there is a gap in international law that encourages the use of the charge of genocide when other charges might be more appropriate &quot;The only way for Bosnia to go to the [[International Court of Justice|ICJ]] was to [[Bosnian Genocide Case|allege genocide]]. There is no Crimes against Humanity Convention providing for jurisdiction for the ICJ&quot;&lt;ref name=CT-2007&gt;Tosh, Caroline [http://iwpr.net/?p=tri&amp;s=f&amp;o=333772&amp;apc_state=henftri333778 Genocide Acquittal Provokes Legal Debat], TU No 491, [http://www.iwpr.net/index.php?p=-&amp;apc_state=henh&amp;s=o&amp;o=top_aims.html Institute for War &amp; Peace Reporting] 2 March 2007. Reporting the views of Larissa van den Herik and others&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Commission|European Union's executive commission]] proposed a European Union–wide anti-racism law in 2001, which included an offense of genocide denial, but European Union states failed to agree on the balance between prohibiting racism and freedom of expression. After six years of wrangling  a watered down compromise was reached in 2007 giving states freedom to implement the legislation as they saw fit.&lt;ref name=EthanMcNern&gt;Ethan McNern.

==Techniques used by illegitimate historical revisionists==

The distinction between respectable academic historians and those of illegitimate [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|historical revisionists]] rests on the techniques used to write such histories. Accuracy and revision are central to historical scholarship. As in any academic discipline, historians' papers are submitted to [[peer review]]. Instead of submitting their work to the challenges of peer review, illegitimate revisionists rewrite history to support an agenda, often political, using any number of techniques and [[Logical fallacy|logical fallacies]] to obtain their results. 

[[Richard J. Evans|Richard Evans]] describes the difference thus:
{{quote|Reputable and professional historians do not suppress parts of quotations from documents that go against their own case, but take them into account and if necessary amend their own case accordingly. They do not present as genuine documents which they know to be forged just because these forgeries happen to back up what they are saying. They do not invent ingenious but implausible and utterly unsupported reasons for distrusting genuine documents because these documents run counter to their arguments; again, they amend their arguments if this is the case, or indeed abandon them altogether. They do not consciously attribute their own conclusions to books and other sources which in fact, on closer inspection, actually say the opposite. They do not eagerly seek out the highest possible figures in a series of statistics, independently of their reliability or otherwise, simply because they want for whatever reason to maximise the figure in question, but rather, they assess all the available figures as impartially as possible in order to arrive at a number that will withstand the critical scrutiny of others. They do not knowingly mistranslate sources in foreign languages in order to make them more serviceable to themselves. They do not wilfully invent words, phrases, quotations, incidents and events for which there is no historical evidence in order to make their arguments more plausible|Richard J. Evans&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard J. Evans]]. David Irving, Hitler and Holocaust Denial: Electronic Edition, [http://www.holocaustdenialontrial.org/trial/defense/evans/6 6. General Conclusion] Paragraphs 6.20,6.21&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

==Writing on genocide denial in general==
Gregory H. Stanton, formerly of the US State Department and the founder of Genocide Watch, lists denial as the final stage of [[Genocide#Stages of genocide and efforts to prevent it|genocide development]]:

{{cquote|Denial is the eighth stage that always follows a genocide. It is among the surest indicators of further genocidal massacres. The perpetrators of genocide dig up the mass graves, burn the bodies, try to cover up the evidence and intimidate the witnesses. They deny that they committed any crimes, and often blame what happened on the victims.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Stanton, [http://www.genocidewatch.org/eightstages.htm Eight Stages of Genocide], Genocide Watch&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[George Orwell]] writes in 'Notes on Nationalism' that

{{cquote|The nationalist not only does not disapprove of atrocities committed by his own side, but he has a remarkable capacity for not even hearing about them. For quite six years the English admirers of Hitler contrived not to learn of the existence of Dachau and Buchenwald. And those who are loudest in denouncing the German concentration camps are often quite unaware, or only very dimly aware, that there are also concentration camps in Russia. Huge events like the Ukraine famine of 1933, involving the deaths of millions of people, have actually escaped the attention of the majority of English russophiles. Many English people have heard almost nothing about the extermination of German and Polish Jews during the present war. Their own antisemitism has caused this vast crime to bounce off their consciousness. In nationalist thought there are facts which are both true and untrue, known and unknown. A known fact may be so unbearable that it is habitually pushed aside and not allowed to enter into logical processes, or on the other hand it may enter into every calculation and yet never be admitted as a fact, even in one's own mind.&lt;ref&gt;George Orwell, [http://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/nationalism/english/e_nat Notes on Nationalism]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Israel Charney]], Executive Director of the Institute on the Holocaust and Genocide in [[Israel]], describes genocide denial by putting it into the following categories: 

{{cquote|1. Innocence-and-Self-Righteousness
The respondents claim that they only intend to ascertain the truth. Moreover, they do not believe that human beings could have been so evil as the descriptions of the genocide imply. Furthermore, even if many deaths took place a long time ago, it is important to put them aside now and forgive and forget.

2. Scientificism in the service of confusion

The position taken is seemingly an innocent one that we do not know enough to know what the facts of history were, and rather than condemning anyone we should await the ultimate decision of research. This is a manipulative misuse of the valued principle in science that facts must be proven before they are accepted in order to obfuscate facts that are indeed known, and to confuse the minds of fair-minded people who do not want to fall prey to myths and propaganda. The very purpose of science, which is to know, is invoked in order to justify a form of know-nothingness.

3. Practicality, pragmatism and realpolitik

Here the claim is made that dealing with ancient history is impractical, it will not bring peace to the world in which we live today. One must be realistic and live through realpolitik.

4. Idea linkage distortion and time-sequence confusion

This is a dishonest linkage of different ideas, often out of time sequence, to excuse denials of the facts. Present needs, whether justified or not, are taken as a reasonable basis for censoring or changing the record of past history.

5. Indirection, definitionalism, and maddening

These are responses which avoid the issue by failing to reply, or no less by going off on tangents about trivial details that avoid the essential issue whether genocide took place. The avoidance can also be done in a seductive manner of acknowledging that the issue should be discussed, but then it never is.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ideajournal.com/articles.php?id=27 The Psychological Satisfaction of Denials of the Holocaust or Other Genocides by Non-Extremists or Bigots, and Even by Known Scholars – by Israel W.

The sentence disputed by Turkey was &quot;Following World War 1, during which one million Armenians were murdered in Turkey, Polish lawyer Raphael Lemkin urged the League of Nations to recognize crimes of barbarity as international crimes&quot;.&lt;ref name=Reuters/&gt; As a diplomatic compromise, the wording was changed to &quot;In 1933, the lawyer Raphael Lemkin, a Polish Jew, urged the League of Nations to recognize mass atrocities against a particular group as an international crime.

* The [[Soviet famine of 1932-1933]] that affected [[Ukraine]], Kazakhstan, and some densely populated regions of Russia, has a special connotation in Ukraine where it is called the [[Holodomor]]. The famine was caused by the confiscation of the whole 1933 harvest in Ukraine, Kazakhstan, the North Caucasus, and other parts of Russia, leaving the peasants too little to feed themselves. As a result an estimated seven million died Soviet-wide, including five million in Ukraine, one million in the North Caucasus, and one million elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Conquest | first = Robert | authorlink = Robert Conquest | title = The Harvest of Sorrow: Soviet Collectivization and the Terror-Famine | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1986 | location = London | pages = 306 | isbn = 0-19-505180-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Viktor Yushchenko|Yushchenko]]'s administration, Ukraine was attempting to have the Holodomor recognised as an act of genocide against [[Ukrainians]].&lt;ref name=BBC-06-11-24&gt;Helen Fawkes ''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6179818.stm Legacy of famine divides Ukraine]'' BBC News 24 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This move is opposed by current President of Ukraine [[Viktor Yanukovych]] and the Russian government, since a lot of non-Ukrainians also died.

{{quote|Denial of the [[Srebrenica genocide]] takes many forms [in Serbia]. The methods range from the brutal to the deceitful.

* The government of [[Pakistan]] continues to deny that the [[1971 Bangladesh atrocities]] took place under Pakistan's rule of [[Bangladesh]] ([[East Pakistan]]) during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] of 1971. They typically accuse Pakistani reporters (such as [[Anthony Mascarenhas]]) who reported on the genocide of being &quot;enemy agents&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;His article was – from Pakistan's point of view – a huge betrayal and he was accused of being an enemy agent.
