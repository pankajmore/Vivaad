'''Feminism''' is a collection of movements and ideologies aimed at defining, establishing, and defending [[feminism and equality|equal]] political, economic, and social rights for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/feminism |title=Feminism – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=merriam-webster.com |accessdate=12 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/feminism |title=Definition of feminism noun from Cambridge Dictionary Online: Free English Dictionary and Thesaurus |publisher=dictionary.cambridge.org |accessdate=12 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, feminism seeks to establish equal opportunities for women in education and employment.

[[Feminist theory]], which emerged from these feminist movements, aims to understand the nature of gender inequality by examining women's social roles and lived experience; it has developed theories in a variety of disciplines in order to respond to issues such as the social construction of sex and gender.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chodorow1989&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author=Chodorow, Nancy |title=Feminism and Psychoanalytic Theory |year=1989 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, Conn. |isbn=978-0-300-05116-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gilligan1977&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gilligan |first=Carol |year=1977 |title='In a Different Voice: Women's Conceptions of Self and Morality'|journal=Harvard Educational Review|volume=47|issue=4 |pages=481–517|url=http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ174986&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ174986 |oclc = |accessdate=8 June 2008 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the earlier forms of feminism have been [[feminism#Civil rights movement and anti-racism|criticized]] for taking into account only white, middle-class, educated perspectives.

Feminist activists campaign for [[women's rights]] – such as in contract law, property, and [[women's suffrage|voting]] – while also promoting bodily integrity, autonomy, and [[reproductive rights]] for women. Feminist campaigns have changed societies, particularly in the West, by achieving [[women's suffrage]], [[gender neutrality in English]], [[equal pay for women]], reproductive rights for women (including access to [[contraceptive]]s and [[support for the legalization of abortion|abortion]]), and the right to enter into contracts and own property.&lt;ref name=&quot;Butler2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Messer-Davidow&quot; /&gt; Feminists have worked to protect women and girls from [[domestic violence]], [[sexual harassment]], and [[sexual assault]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Echols&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author=Echols, Alice |authorlink=Alice Echols |title=Daring to Be Bad: Radical Feminism in America, 1967–1975 |year=1989 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |location=Minneapolis |isbn=0-8166-1787-2 |page=416}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cornell&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author=Cornell, Drucilla |authorlink=Drucilla Cornell|title=At the Heart of Freedom: Feminism, Sex, and Equality |year=1998 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, N.J. |isbn=978-0-691-02896-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnesty.org/en/campaigns/stop-violence-against-women/issues/implementation-existing-laws ''Campaign: Stop Violence against Women''].&lt;/ref&gt; They have also advocated for workplace rights, including [[maternity leave]], and against forms of [[gender equality|discrimination against women]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Butler2&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Butler |first=Judith |title=Feminism in Any Other Name |journal=Differences |volume=6 |page=30 |month=March |year=1992 |issue=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Messer-Davidow&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author=Messer-Davidow, Ellen |title=Disciplining Feminism: From Social Activism to Academic Discourse |year=2002 |publisher=Duke University Press |location=Durham, [[North Carolina|N.C.]] |isbn=0-8223-2843-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;shildrick&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author=Price, Janet |coauthors=Shildrick, Margrit |title=Feminist Theory and the Body: A Reader |year=1999 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=0-415-92566-5 |page=487}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminism is mainly focused on women's issues, but because feminism seeks gender equality, some feminists argue that [[men's liberation]] is a necessary part of feminism, and that men are also harmed by sexism and gender roles.

== Theory ==
{{main|Feminist theory}}
{{see also|Gynocriticism|écriture féminine}}
Feminist theory is the extension of feminism into theoretical or philosophical fields. It encompasses work in a variety of disciplines, including [[feminist anthropology|anthropology]], [[feminist sociology|sociology]], [[feminist economics|economics]], [[women's studies]], [[feminist literary criticism|literary criticism]],&lt;ref name=Zajko&gt;{{cite book |author=Zajko, Vanda |coauthors=Leonard, Miriam |title=Laughing with Medusa: classical myth and feminist thought |year=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-927438-X |page=445}}

While providing a critique of these social and political relations, much of feminist theory also focuses on the promotion of women's rights and interests. Themes explored in feminist theory include discrimination, [[stereotyping]], [[objectification]] (especially [[sexual objectification]]), [[oppression]], and [[patriarchy]].&lt;ref name=Chodorow1989&gt;{{cite book |author=Chodorow, Nancy |title=Feminism and psychoanalytic theory |year=1989 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, Conn. |isbn=978-0-300-05116-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gilligan1977&gt;{{cite journal |first=Carol |last=Gilligan |year=1977 |title=In a different voice: Women's conceptions of self and of morality |journal=Harvard Educational Review |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=481-517 |url=http://her.hepg.org/content/g6167429416hg5l0/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of [[literary criticism]], [[Elaine Showalter]] describes the development of feminist theory as having three phases. The first she calls &quot;feminist critique&quot;, in which the feminist reader examines the ideologies behind literary phenomena. The second Showalter calls &quot;[[gynocriticism]]&quot;, in which the &quot;woman is producer of textual meaning&quot;. The last phase she calls &quot;gender theory&quot;, in which the &quot;ideological inscription and the literary effects of the sex/gender system are explored&quot;.&lt;ref name=showalter1979&gt;{{cite book |last1=Showalter |first1=Elaine |authorlink1=Elaine Showalter |editor1-first=M. |editor1-last=Jacobus |title=Women Writing about Women |year=1979 |publisher=Croom Helm |isbn=978-0-85664-745-1 |pages=25–36 |chapter=Towards a Feminist Poetics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was paralled in the 1970s by [[French structuralist feminism|French feminists]], who developed the concept of ''[[écriture féminine]]'' (which translates as female, or feminine writing).&lt;ref name=Wright2000&gt;{{cite book |author=Wright, Elizabeth |title=''Lacan and Postfeminism (Postmodern Encounters)'' |year=2000 |publisher=Icon Books |isbn=978-1-84046-182-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Helene Cixous]] argues that writing and philosophy are ''[[Wikt:phallocentric|phallocentric]]'' and along with other French feminists such as [[Luce Irigaray]] emphasize &quot;writing from the body&quot; as a subversive exercise.&lt;ref name=Wright2000/&gt; The work of the feminist psychoanalyst and philosopher, [[Julia Kristeva]], has influenced feminist theory in general and [[feminist literary criticism]] in particular. However, as the scholar Elizabeth Wright points out, &quot;none of these French feminists align themselves with the feminist movement as it appeared in the [[Anglosphere|Anglophone]] world&quot;.&lt;ref name=Wright2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=Moi1986&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kristeva |first1=Julia |last2=Moi |first2=Toril |authorlink2=Toril Moi |title=The Kristeva reader |year=1986 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-231-06325-3 |page=328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Movements and ideologies ==
{{Details|Feminist movements and ideologies|the many feminist movements}}
Many overlapping feminist movements and ideologies have developed over the years.

===Political movements===
Some branches of feminism closely track the political leanings of the larger society, such as liberalism and conservatism, or focus on the environment. [[Liberal feminism]] seeks individualistic equality of men and women through political and legal reform without altering the structure of society. [[Radical feminism]] considers the male-controlled capitalist hierarchy as the defining feature of women's oppression and the total uprooting and reconstruction of society as necessary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Echols&quot; /&gt; [[List of conservative feminisms|Conservative feminism]] is conservative relative to the society in which it resides. [[Individualist feminism|Libertarian feminism]] conceives of people as self-owners and therefore as entitled to freedom from coercive interference.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot;&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-liberal/#ClasCri ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Separatist feminism]] does not support heterosexual relationships. Lesbian feminism is thus closely related. Other feminists criticize separatist feminism as sexist.&lt;ref name=&quot;hooks&quot;&gt;bell hooks (2000), Feminism is for Everybody: Passionate Politics. Cited in Austin, Hannah (2004) &quot;Separatism: Are We Limiting Ourselves?&quot;, EM 4:2&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eco-feminist|Ecofeminist]]s see men's control of land as responsible for the oppression of women and destruction of the [[ecology|natural environment]]; ecofeminism has been criticised for focusing too much on a mystical connection between women and nature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biehl&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author=Biehl, Janet |authorlink=Janet Biehl |title=Rethinking Eco-Feminist Politics |year=1991 |publisher=South End Press |location=Boston |isbn=978-0-89608-392-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Materialist ideologies===
Rosemary Hennessy and Chrys Ingraham say that materialist feminisms grew out of western marxist thought and have inspired a number of different (but overlapping) movements, all of which are involved in a critique of capitalism and are focussed on ideology's relationship to women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Hennessy |first= Rosemary |coauthors=Chrys Ingraham |title=''Materialist feminism: a reader in class, difference, and women's lives'' |location= London |publisher=Routledge | pages=1–13 |isbn=978-0-415-91634-9 |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marxist feminism]] argues that capitalism is the root cause of women's oppression, and that discrimination against women in domestic life and employment is an effect of capitalist ideologies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bottomore&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author=Bottomore, T.B. |title=A Dictionary of Marxist thought |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell | page=215 |isbn=978-0-631-18082-1 |year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Socialist feminism]] distinguishes itself from Marxist feminism by arguing that women's liberation can only be achieved by working to end both the economic and cultural sources of women's oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.feministezine.com/feminist/modern/Socialist-Feminism.html |title=What is Socialist Feminism? |author=Barbara Ehrenreich |publisher=feministezine.com |accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anarcha-feminism|Anarcha-feminist]]s believe that [[class struggle]] and [[anarchism|anarchy]] against the [[State (polity)|state]]&lt;ref name=&quot;farrow&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Dunbar-Ortiz |first=Roxanne |title=Quiet Rumours |publisher=AK Press |isbn=978-1-902593-40-1 |year=2002}}{{pn|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; require struggling against [[patriarchy]], which comes from involuntary hierarchy.

===Black and postcolonial ideologies===
Sara Ahmed argues that [[Black feminism|Black]] and [[Postcolonial feminism|Postcolonial]] feminisms pose a challenge &quot;to some of the organizing premises of Western feminist thought.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahmed&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author=Ahmed, Sarta |title=	Transformations: thinking through feminism |year=2000 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-22066-8 |page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; During much of its [[history of feminism|history]], feminist movements and [[Feminism#Theoretical schools|theoretical developments]] were led predominantly by middle-class white women from Western Europe and North America.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author=Walker, Alice |title=[[In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens: Womanist Prose]] |year=1983 |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |location=San Diego |isbn=0-15-144525-7 |page=397}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BFT&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Hill Collins |first=P. |title=Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness, and the Politics of Empowerment |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |year=2000}}{{pn|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Narayan&quot;/&gt; However women of other races have proposed alternative feminisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;BFT&quot; /&gt; This trend accelerated in the 1960s with the civil rights movement in the United States and the collapse of European colonialism in Africa, the Caribbean, parts of Latin America, and Southeast Asia. Since that time, women in [[Third World|developing nations]] and [[postcolonialism|former colonies]] and who are of colour or various ethnicities or living in poverty have proposed additional feminisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Narayan&quot; /&gt; [[Womanism]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Ogunyemi&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/494200 |title=Womanism: The Dynamics of the Contemporary Black Female Novel in English |year=1985 |last1=Ogunyemi |first1=Chikwenye Okonjo |journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=63–80 |jstor=3174287}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kolawole&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author=Kolawole, Mary Ebun Modupe |title=Womanism and African Consciousness |year=1997 |publisher=Africa World Press |location=Trenton, N.J. |isbn=0-86543-540-5 |page=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; emerged after early feminist movements were largely white and middle-class.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker&quot; /&gt; Postcolonial feminists argue that colonial oppression and Western feminism marginalized postcolonial women but did not turn them passive or voiceless.&lt;ref name=Weedon&gt;{{cite web |last=Weedon Chris |title=Key Issues in Postcolonial Feminism: A Western Perspective |year=2002 |url=http://www.genderforum.org/issues/genderealisations/key-issues-in-postcolonial-feminism-a-western-perspective/ |work=Gender Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Third-world feminism]] is closely related to postcolonial feminism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Narayan&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Narayan |first=Uma |title=Dislocating Cultures: Identities, Traditions, and Third-World Feminism |year=1997 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=0-415-91418-3}}{{pn|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas also correspond with ideas in African feminism, motherism,&lt;ref name=&quot;Acholonu&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Obianuju Acholonu |first=Catherine |title=Motherism: The Afrocentric Alternative to Feminism |year=1995 |publisher=Afa Publ. |isbn=978-31997-1-4 |page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stiwanism,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ogundipe-Leslie&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Ogundipe-Leslie |first=Molara |title=Re-creating Ourselves: African Women &amp; Critical Transformations |year=1994 |publisher=Africa World Press |isbn=0-86543-412-3 |page=262}}&lt;/ref&gt; negofeminism,&lt;ref name=&quot;Nnaemeka&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nnaemeka |first=Obioma |title=Feminism, Rebellious Women, and Cultural Boundaries: Rereading Flora Nwapa and Her Compatriots |journal=Research in African Literatures |year=1995 |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=80–113 |jstor=3820273}}&lt;/ref&gt; femalism, [[transnational feminism]], and [[Africana womanism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hudson-Weems&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hudson-Weems |first=Clenora |title=Africana Womanism: Reclaiming Ourselves |year=1994 |publisher=Bedford Publishers |location=Troy, Mich. |isbn=0-911557-11-3 |page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social constructionist ideologies===
In the late twentieth century various feminists began to argue that [[gender roles]] are [[social construction|socially constructed]],&lt;ref name=Butler/&gt;&lt;ref name=West&amp;Zimmerman&gt;{{citation |last=West |first=Candace | last2 = Zimmerman | first2 = Don H. |title=Doing Gender |journal=Gender and Society |volume=1 |issue=2 |page=26 |date=June 1987 |url=http://gas.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/1/2/125 |doi=10.1177/0891243287001002002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that it is impossible to generalize women's experiences across cultures and histories.&lt;ref name=Benhabib&gt;{{citation |last=Benhabib |first=Seyla |title=From Identity Politics to Social Feminism: A Plea for the Nineties |journal=Philosophy of Education |volume=1 |issue=2 |page=14 |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Post-structural feminism]] draws on the philosophies of [[post-structuralism]] and [[deconstruction]] in order to argue that the concept of gender is created socially and culturally through [[discourse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Randall, Vicky | editor1-last= Marsh |editor1-first=David | editor2-last= Stoker |editor2-first=Gerry |title=''Theory and Methods in Political Science'' |chapter='Feminism' |year=2010 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillian |location=Basingstoke |isbn=978-0-415-92499-3|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Postmodern feminism|Postmodern feminists]] also emphasize the social construction of gender and the discursive nature of reality,&lt;ref name=&quot;Butler&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author=Butler, Judith |title=Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity |year=1999 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=978-0-415-92499-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; however as Pamela Abbot et al. note, a postmodern approach to feminism highlights &quot;the existence of multiple truths (rather than simply men and women's standpoints).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Abbot |first1=Pamela |last2=Wallace |first2=Claire |coauthors=Melissa Tyler  |title=''An Introduction to Sociology: Feminist Perspectives'' |year=1996 |edition=2nd |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-1-134-38245-3 |page=380 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural movements===
[[Riot grrrl]] (or riot grrl) is an underground feminist [[Punk rock|punk]] movement that started in the 1990s and is often associated with [[third-wave feminism]]. It was grounded in the [[DIY ethic|DIY philosophy]] of [[Punk ideologies#Punk ethics|punk values]].

=== Visual arts movement===
{{main|Feminist art movement}}
The feminist art movement refers to the efforts and accomplishments of feminists internationally to make art that reflects women's lives and experiences, as well as to change the foundation for the production and reception of contemporary art. It also sought to bring more visibility to women within [[art history]] and art practice.&lt;ref name=tate/&gt; Corresponding with general developments within feminism, and often including such self-organizing tactics as the consciousness-raising group, the movement began in the 1960s and flourished throughout the 1970s.&lt;ref name=Gopnik/&gt; Jeremy Strick, director of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, described the feminist art movement as &quot;the most influential international movement of any during the postwar period&quot;, and [[Peggy Phelan]] says that it &quot;brought about the most far-reaching transformations in both artmaking and art writing over the past four decades&quot;.&lt;ref name=Gopnik&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/20/AR2007042000400.html |title=What Is Feminist Art? |author=Blake Gopnik |date=22 April 2007 |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Judy Chicago]], who with a team of 129 created ''[[The Dinner Party]]'', said in 2009 to ''[[ARTnews]]'', &quot;There is still an institutional lag and an insistence on a male Eurocentric narrative. We are trying to change the future: to get girls and boys to realize that women's art is not an exception—it's a normal part of art history.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Hoban, Phoebe|url=http://www.artnews.com/2009/12/01/the-feminist-evolution/|title=The Feminist Evolution|date=December 2009|work=ARTnews|accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feminism and sexuality ==
Over the course of the 1970s, a large variety of influential women accepted lesbianism and [[bisexuality]] as part of feminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McBride|first=Andrew|title=Lesbian History|url=http://sitemaker.umich.edu/lesbian.history/the_sex_wars}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, a significant proportion of feminists favoured this view, however, others considered sexuality irrelevant to the attainment of other goals. Sexuality, sexual representation, [[sadomasochism]], the role of [[transwomen]] in the lesbian community, and other sexual issues arose within acrimonious feminist debates known as the [[feminist sex wars]].

===Sex industry===
{{main|Sex industry}}
Opinions on the sex industry are diverse. Feminists are generally either critical of it (seeing it as exploitative, a result of patriarchal social structures and reinforcing sexual and cultural attitudes that are complicit in rape and [[sexual harassment]]) or supportive of at least parts of it (arguing that some forms of it can be a medium of feminist expression and a means of women taking control of their sexuality).

==== Pornography ====
{{details|Feminist sex wars}}
{{see also|Anti-pornography#Feminist objections|Sex-positive feminism}}
The &quot;Feminist Sex Wars&quot; is a term for the acrimonious debates within the feminist movement in the late 1970s through the 1980s around the issues of feminism, sexuality, sexual representation, pornography, [[sadomasochism]], the role of [[transwomen]] in the lesbian community, and other sexual issues. The debate pitted [[Anti-pornography movement|anti-pornography feminism]] against sex-positive feminism, and parts of the feminist movement were deeply divided by these debates.&lt;ref name=Duggan&gt;{{cite book |author=Duggan, Lisa; Hunter, Nan D. |title=Sex wars: sexual dissent and political culture |year=1995 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=0-415-91036-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hansen&gt;{{cite book |author=Hansen, Karen Tranberg; |coauthors=Philipson, Ilene J. |title=Women, class, and the feminist imagination: a socialist-feminist reader |year=1990 |publisher=Temple University Press |location=Philadelphia |isbn=0-87722-630-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gerhard&gt;{{cite book |author=Gerhard, Jane F. |title=Desiring revolution: second-wave feminism and the rewriting of American sexual thought, 1920 to 1982 |year=2001 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-231-11204-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Leidholdt&gt;{{cite book |author=Leidholdt, Dorchen; |authorlink=Dorchen Leidholdt |coauthors=Raymond, Janice G |title=The Sexual liberals and the attack on feminism |year=1990 |publisher=Pergamon Press |location=New York |isbn=0-08-037457-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vance&gt;{{cite book |author=Vance, Carole S. |title=Pleasure and Danger: Exploring Female Sexuality |publisher=Thorsons Publishers|isbn=0-04-440593-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Prostitution and trafficking ====
{{Main|Feminist views on prostitution}}
Feminists' views on prostitution vary, but many of these perspectives can be loosely arranged into an overarching standpoint that is generally either critical or supportive  of prostitution and [[sex work]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O’Neill |first=Maggie |year=2001 |title=Prostitution and Feminism |publisher=Polity Press |location=Cambridge |pages=14–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-prostitution feminists are strongly opposed to prostitution, as they see the practice as a form of violence against and exploitation of women, and a sign of male dominance over women. Feminists who hold such views on prostitution include [[Kathleen Barry]], [[Melissa Farley]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Melissa |last=Farley |url=http://www.prostitutionresearch.com/faq/000008.html |title=Prostitution: Factsheet on Human Rights Violations |publisher=Prostitution Research &amp; Education |date=2 April 2000 |accessdate=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1300/J015v26n03_06 |url=http://www.prostitutionresearch.com/prostitution_research/000176.html |title=Prostitution and the Invisibility of Harm |year=2003 |last1=Farley |first1=Melissa |journal=Women &amp; Therapy |volume=26 |issue=3–4 |pages=247–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julie Bindel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2006/jan/18/ukcrime.prisonsandprobation |title=Eradicate the oldest oppression |author=Julie Bindel |date=18 January 2006 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=8 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2007/sep/10/endingatradeinmisery |title=Ending a trade in misery |date=10 September 2007 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=3 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sheila Jeffreys]], [[Catharine MacKinnon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Catharine A. |last1=MacKinnon |year=1993 |url=http://www.prostitutionresearch.com/mackinnon1.html |title=Prostitution And Civil Rights |journal=Michigan Journal of Gender &amp; Law |volume=1 |issue=1993 |pages=13–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Laura Lederer]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lederer |first=Laura J. |url=http://www.globalcenturion.org/Articles/Demand.aspx |title=Addressing Demand: Examining New Practices |publisher=Global Centurion |accessdate=3 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[European Women's Lobby]] has also condemned prostitution as &quot;an intolerable form of male violence&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Prostitution in Europe: 60 Years of Reluctance |publisher=[[European Women's Lobby]] |date=1 December 2009 |url=http://www.womenslobby.eu/spip.php?article472 |accessdate=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other feminists hold that prostitution and other forms of [[sex work]] can be valid choices for women and men who choose to engage in it. In this view, prostitution must be differentiated from forced prostitution, and feminists should support [[sex workers' rights|sex worker activism]] against abuses by both the sex industry and the legal system. The disagreement between these two feminist stances was particularly contentious, and may be comparable to the [[feminist sex wars]] of the late twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Alexander |first=Priscilla |year=1997 |chapter=Feminism, Sex Workers and Human Rights |editor1-last=Nagle |editor1-first=Jill |title=Whores and Other Feminists |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |pages=83–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feminism and science ==
{{Details|Feminist epistemology}}

Sandra Harding says that the &quot;moral and political insights of the women's movement have inspired social scientists and biologists to raise critical questions about the ways traditional researchers have explained gender, sex and relations within and between the social and natural worlds.&quot;&lt;ref name=Harding_method&gt;{{cite book|author=Harding, Sandra|editor=Nancy Tuana|year=1989|title=Feminism &amp; Science|chapter= 'Is Therea Feminist Method'|publisher=Indianna University Press|isbn=978-0-253-20525-4|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some feminists, such as [[Ruth Hubbard]] and [[Evelyn Fox Keller]], criticize traditional [[rhetoric of science|scientific discourse]] as being historically biased towards a male perspective.&lt;ref name=&quot;shildrick&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hubbard, Ruth|year=1990|title=The Politics of Women's Biology|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=0-8135-1490-8|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; A part of the feminist research agenda is the examination of the ways in which power inequities are created and/or reinforced in scientific and academic institutions.&lt;ref name=&quot;QCommRsrch&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Lindlof | first1 = Thomas R. | last2 = Taylor | first2 = Bryan C. | title = Qualitative Communication Research Methods | publisher = Sage Publications | location = Thousand Oaks, Calif | year = 2002 | isbn = 978-0-7619-2493-7 |page = 357}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physicist [[Lisa Randall]], appointed to a task force  at Harvard by then-president [[Lawrence Summers]] after his controversial discussion of why women may be underrepresented in science and engineering, said, &quot;I just want to see a whole bunch more women enter the field so these issues don't have to come up anymore.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Holloway, Marguerite|title=The Beauty of Branes|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-beauty-of-branes|date=26 September 2005|work=Scientific American|publisher=Nature America|accessdate=12 December 2011|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lynn Hankinson Nelson notes that feminist empiricists argue that there are fundamental differences between the experiences of men and women, thus they seek to obtain knowledge through the examination of the experiences of women, and attempt to &quot;uncover the consequences of omitting, misdescribing, or devaluing them&quot; for account of human experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hankinson Nelson, Lynn |year=1990|title=''Who Knows: from Quine To a Feminist Empiricism''|publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=978-0-87722-647-5|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other feminist scientists eschew objectivity in favor of self-reflexivity and the agenda of helping women.&lt;ref name=&quot;QCommRsrch&quot;/&gt; Also, part of the feminist research agenda is the uncovering of ways in which power inequities are created and/or reinforced in society and in scientific and academic institutions.&lt;ref name=&quot;QCommRsrch&quot;/&gt;

One criticism of feminist epistemology is that it allows social and political values to influence its findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hankinson Nelson, Lynn |year=1997|title=''Feminism, Science, and the Philosophy of Science''|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-7923-4611-1|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Susan Haack also points out that feminist epistemology reinforces traditional stereotypes about women's thinking (as intuitive and emotional, etc.), Meera Nanda further cautions that this may in fact trap women within &quot;traditional gender roles and help justify patriarchy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-epistemology/ |title=Feminist Epistemology and Philosophy of Science |author=Anderson, Elizabeth, |publisher=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |accessdate=6 December 2011|year=2011 |journal=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy  |issue=Spring 2011 |editor=Edward N. Zalta }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biology and gender ===
{{details3|[[Gender essentialism]] and [[Sexual differentiation]]}}
Modern feminist science challenges the biological essentialist view of [[gender]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Code |first=Lorraine |title=Encyclopedia of feminist theories |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2000 |isbn=0-415-13274-6 |page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bern, Sandra L., ''The lenses of gender: transforming the debate on sexual inequality'', Yale University Press, 1993, ISBN 0-300-05676-1, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is increasingly interested in the study of [[sexual differentiation|biological sex differences]] and their effect on [[human behavior]]. For example, [[Anne Fausto-Sterling]]'s book, ''Myths of Gender'', explores the assumptions embodied in scientific research that purports to support a biologically [[essentialist]] view of gender.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fausto-Sterling&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Fausto-Sterling |first=Anne |title=Myths of Gender: Biological Theories About Women and Men |year=1992 |publisher=BasicBooks |location=New York, New York  |isbn=0-465-04792-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, in ''[[Delusions of Gender]]'' [[Cordelia Fine]] argues that there is currently no scientific evidence for innate biological differences between men and women's minds, and that cultural and societal beliefs contribute to commonly perceived sex differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Fine |first=Cordelia |title=Delusions of Gender: How Our Minds, Society, and Neurosexism Create Difference |publisher=W.

== Feminist culture ==
{{Main|Feminism in culture}}

=== Architecture ===
Gender-based inquiries into and conceptualization of architecture have also come about, leading to [[Feminism and modern architecture|feminism in modern architecture]]. Piyush Mathur coined the term &quot;archigenderic&quot;. Claiming that &quot;architectural planning has an inextricable link with the defining and regulation of gender roles, responsibilities, rights, and limitations&quot;, Mathur came up with that term &quot;to explore...the meaning of 'architecture' in terms of gender&quot; and &quot;to explore the meaning of 'gender' in terms of architecture&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Mathur, Piyush, in ''Women's Writing'', p.&amp;nbsp;71 (1998) (British journal) (article).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Art===
According to the [[Tate Collection]], feminist art can &quot;be defined as art by women artists made consciously in the light of developments in feminist art theory since about 1970.&quot;&lt;ref name=tate&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=103 |title=Tate Collection Glossary &quot;Feminist art&quot; |accessdate=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Literature ===
[[File:Butler signing.jpg|thumb|[[Octavia Butler]], award-winning feminist science fiction author.]]
{{further|Women's writing in English|Écriture féminine}}
The feminist movement produced both feminist fiction and non-fiction, and created new interest in women's writing. It also prompted a general reevaluation of women's [[Women's history|historical]] and academic contributions in response to the belief that women's lives and contributions have been underrepresented as areas of scholarly interest.&lt;ref name=Blain&gt;{{cite book |author=Blain, Virginia |coauthors=Clements, Patricia; Grundy, Isobel |title=The feminist companion to literature in English: women writers from the Middle Ages to the present |year=1990 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=0-300-04854-8 |page=vii–x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the early period of feminist literary scholarship was given over to the rediscovery and reclamation of texts written by women.  Studies like Dale Spender's ''Mothers of the Novel'' (1986) and Jane Spencer's ''The Rise of the Woman Novelist'' (1986) were ground-breaking in their insistence that women have always been writing. Commensurate with this growth in scholarly interest, various presses began the task of reissuing long-out-of-print texts. Virago Press began to publish its large list of 19th and early-20th-century novels in 1975 and became one of the first commercial presses to join in the project of reclamation. In the 1980s Pandora Press, responsible for publishing Spender's study, issued a companion line of 18th-century novels by written by women.&lt;ref&gt;Sandra M. Gilbert, &quot;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE4DD1E3AF937A35756C0A960948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1 Paperbacks: From Our Mothers' Libraries: women who created the novel].&quot; ''New York Times'', 4 May 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Broadview Press continues to issue 18th- and 19th-century novels, many hitherto out of print, and the University of Kentucky has a series of republications of early women's novels.

The widespread interest in women's writing is related to a general reassessment and expansion of the [[literary canon]]. Interest in [[post-colonial literature]]s, [[LGBT literature|gay and lesbian literature]], writing by people of colour, working people's writing, and the cultural productions of other historically marginalized groups has resulted in a whole scale expansion of what is considered &quot;literature,&quot; and genres hitherto not regarded as &quot;literary,&quot; such as children's writing, journals, letters, travel writing, and many others are now the subjects of scholarly interest.&lt;ref name=Blain/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Buck |editor1-first=Claire |title=The Bloomsbury Guide to Women's Literature |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=1992 |page=vix}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Salzman |first=Paul |chapter=Introduction |title=Early Modern Women's Writing |publisher=Oxford UP |year=2000 |pages=ix–x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[Literary genre|genres and sub-genres]] have undergone a similar analysis, so that one now sees work on the &quot;female gothic&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Term coined by Ellen Moers in ''Literary Women: The Great Writers'' (New York: Doubleday, 1976). See also Juliann E. Fleenor, ed., ''The Female Gothic'' (Montreal: Eden Press, 1983) and Gary Kelly, ed., ''Varieties of Female Gothic'' 6 Vols. (London: Pickering &amp; Chatto, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Women in science fiction|women's science fiction]].

According to Elyce Rae Helford &quot;Science fiction and fantasy serve as important vehicles for feminist thought, particularly as bridges between theory and practice.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Helford, Elyce Rae |editor=Gary Westfahl |title=''The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy'' |chapter=Feminist Science Fiction |year=2005 |publisher=Greenwood Press |isbn=0-300-04854-8 |pages=289–291}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist science fiction is sometimes taught at the university level to explore the role of [[social construct]]s in understanding gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1207/s15328023top1703_17 |title=Using Science Fiction to Teach the Psychology of Sex and Gender |year=1990 |last1=Lips |first1=Hilary M. |journal=Teaching of Psychology |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=197–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable texts of this kind are [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s ''[[The Left Hand of Darkness]]'' (1969), [[Joanna Russ]]' ''[[The Female Man]]'' (1970), [[Octavia Butler]]'s ''[[Kindred (novel)|Kindred]]'' (1979) and [[Margaret Atwood]]'s ''[[Handmaid's Tale]]'' (1985).

=== Music ===
{{main| Women's music}}

Women's music (or womyn's music or wimmin's music) is the music by women, for women, and about women.&lt;ref name=&quot;NoSmPvtPty&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lont |first1=Cynthia |chapter=Women's Music: No Longer a Small Private Party |editor1-first=Reebee |editor1-last=Garofalo |title=Rockin' the Boat: Mass Music &amp; Mass Movements |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=South End Press |year=1992 |isbn=0-89608-427-2 |page=242}}&lt;/ref&gt; The genre emerged as a musical expression of the [[second-wave feminist]] movement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1525/jams.2001.54.3.692 |title=Girls with guitars and other strange stories |year=2001 |last1=Peraino |first1=Judith A. |journal=Journal of the American Musicological Society |volume=54 |issue=3 |pages=692–709 |url=http://business.highbeam.com/437059/article-1G1-86048837/girls-guitars-and-other-strange-stories}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[labour (economics)|labor]], [[civil rights]], and [[peace movement]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;RadHarmonies&quot;&gt;Mosbacher, Dee, ''Radical Harmonies'', ''Woman Vision'' (2002 (OCLC 53071762)). See also [http://www.woman-vision.org/radicalharmonies/index.htm].&lt;/ref&gt; The movement was started by lesbians such as [[Cris Williamson]], [[Meg Christian]], and [[Margie Adam]], African-American women activists such as [[Bernice Johnson Reagon]] and her group [[Sweet Honey in the Rock]], and peace activist [[Holly Near]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RadHarmonies&quot; /&gt; Women's music also refers to the wider industry of women's music that goes beyond the performing artists to include [[studio musicians]], [[record producer|producers]], [[sound engineer]]s, [[technician]]s, cover artists, distributors, [[promoter (entertainment)|promoter]]s, and festival organizers who are also women.&lt;ref name=&quot;NoSmPvtPty&quot; /&gt;

Feminism became a principal concern of musicologists in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=mus&gt;Beard, David; Gload, Kenneth. 2005. Musicology : The Key Concepts. London and New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this, in the 1970s, musicologists were beginning to discover women composers and performers, and had begun to review concepts of canon, genius, genre and periodization from a feminist perspective. In other words, the question of how women musicians fit into traditional music history was now being asked.&lt;ref name=mus/&gt;

Through the 1980s and 1990s, this trend continued as musicologists like [[Susan McClary]], [[Marcia Citron]] and Ruth Solie began to consider the cultural reasons for the marginalizing of women from the received body of work. Concepts such as music as gendered discourse; professionalism; reception of women's music; examination of the sites of music production; relative wealth and education of women; popular music studies in relation to women's identity; patriarchal ideas in music analysis; and notions of gender and difference are among the themes examined during this time.&lt;ref name=mus/&gt;

== Relationship to political movements ==
Feminism had complex interactions with the major political movements of the twentieth century.

=== Socialism ===
{{main|Left-wing politics#Social progressivism and counterculture|l1=Social Progressivism and Counterculture}}
Since the late nineteenth century some feminists have allied with socialism, whereas others have criticized socialist ideology for being insufficiently concerned about women's rights. [[August Bebel]], an early activist of the [[German Social Democratic Party]], published his work ''Die Frau und der Sozialismus'', juxtaposing the struggle for equal rights between sexes with social equality in general. In 1907 there was an International Conference of Socialist Women in [[Stuttgart]] where suffrage was described as a tool of class struggle. [[Clara Zetkin]] of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] called for women's suffrage to build a &quot;''socialist order, the only one that allows for a radical solution to the women's question''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxismo.net/idm/idm5/idm5.htm|title=Rossi, Elisabetta.

In Britain, the women's movement was allied with the [[Labour party (UK)|Labour party]]. In the U.S., [[Betty Friedan]] emerged from a radical background to take leadership. [[Radical Women]] is the oldest socialist feminist organization in the U.S. and is still active.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Radical Women Manifesto: Socialist Feminist Theory, Program and Organizational Structure |year=2001 |publisher=Red Letter Press |location=Seattle, WA |isbn=0-932323-11-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Spanish Civil War]], [[Dolores Ibárruri]] (''La Pasionaria'') led the [[Communist Party of Spain (main)|Communist Party of Spain]]. Although she supported equal rights for women, she opposed women fighting on the front and clashed with the [[Anarcha-Feminism|anarcha-feminist]] [[Mujeres Libres]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ib&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author=Ibárruri, Dolores |title=Speeches &amp; Articles, 1936–1938 |year=1938 |publisher=University of Michigan |page=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fascism ===
{{Further2|[[Fascism and ideology]]}}
Like socialism, fascism has been prescribed dubious stances on feminism by its practitioners and by women's groups. Amongst other demands concerning social reform presented in the [[Fascist manifesto]] in 1919 was expanding the suffrage to all Italian citizens of age 18 and above, including women (accomplished only in 1946, after the defeat of fascism) and eligibility for all to stand for office from age 25. This demand was particularly championed by special Fascist women's auxiliary groups such as the ''fasci femminilli'' and only partly realized in 1925, under pressure from Prime Minister [[Benito Mussolini]]'s more conservative coalition partners.&lt;ref&gt;Göran Hägg, ''Mussolini – En studie i makt''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Passmore, ''Women, Gender and Fascism''&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyprian Blamires states that although feminists were among those who opposed the rise of [[Adolf Hitler]], feminism has a complicated relationship with the [[Nazi]] movement as well, which saw several vocal female supporters as well as women's groups. While Nazis glorified traditional notions of patriarchal society and its role for women, they claimed to recognize women's equality in employment.&lt;ref name=Blamires&gt;{{cite book |title=''World Fascism:A Historical Encyclopedia'' |last=Blamires |first=Cyprian |volume=1 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-57607-940-9 |pages=232–233}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hitler and [[Benito Mussolini]] declared themselves as opposed to feminism,&lt;ref name=Blamires/&gt; and after the rise of [[Nazism]] in Germany in 1933, there was a rapid dissolution of the political rights and economic opportunities that feminists had fought for during the prewar period and to some extent during the 1920s.&lt;ref name=hww5/&gt; Georges Duby et al. note that in practice fascist society was hierarchical and emphasized male virility, with women maintaining a largely subordinate position.&lt;ref name=hww5&gt;{{cite book |author=Duby, Georges |coauthors=Perrot, Michelle; Pantel, Pauline, Schmitt |title=A history of women in the West |year=1994 |publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Mass. |isbn=0-674-40369-X |page=600}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blamires also notes that Neofascism has since the 1960s been hostile towards feminism and advocates that women accept &quot;their traditional roles&quot;.&lt;ref name=Blamires/&gt;

=== Civil rights movement and anti-racism ===
The [[civil rights movement]] has influenced and informed the feminist movement and vice versa. Many Western feminists adapted the language and theories of black equality activism and drew parallels between women's rights and the rights of non-white people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levy&quot;&gt;Levy, Peter B. ''The civil rights movement '',  Greenwood Publishing Group, 1998, ISBN 0-313-29854-8&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the connections between the women's and civil rights movements, some tension arose during the late 1960s and early 1970s as non-white women argued that feminism was predominantly white and middle class, and did not understand and was not concerned with race issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Code |first=Lorraine |title=Encyclopedia of feminist theories |chapter=civil rights |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2000 |isbn=0-415-13274-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, some women argued that the civil rights movement had sexist elements and did not adequately address minority women's concerns.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levy&quot; /&gt; These criticisms created new feminist social theories about the intersections of racism, [[classism]], and sexism, and new feminisms, such as black feminism and Chicana feminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Roth |first=Benita |title=Separate roads to feminism: Black, Chicana, and White feminist movements in America's second wave |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2004 |isbn=0-521-52972-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Winddance Twine |first1=France |first2=Kathleen M. |last2=Blee |title=Feminism and antiracism: international struggles for justice |publisher=NYU Press |year=2001 |isbn=0-8147-9855-1}}{{pn|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|History of feminism}}
{{see also|Protofeminist}}
Depending on historical moment, culture and country, feminists around the world have had different causes and goals. Most western feminist historians assert that all movements that work to obtain [[women's rights]] should be considered feminist movements, even when they did not (or do not) apply the term to themselves.&lt;ref name=&quot;spender&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Spender |first=Dale |title=There's always been a women's movement |publisher=Pandora Press |location=London |year=1983}}{{pn|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lerner |first=Gerda |title=The Creation of Feminist Consciousness From the Middle Ages to Eighteen-seventy |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1993}}{{pn|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;walters&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Walters |first=Margaret |title=Feminism: A very short introduction |publisher=Oxford University |year=2005 |isbn=0-19-280510-X}}{{pn|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kinnaird&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kinnaird |first1=Joan |first2=Mary |last2=Astell |chapter=Inspired by ideas (1668–1731) |editor1-last=Spender |editor1-first=Dale |title=There's always been a women's movement |publisher=Pandora Press |location=London |year=1983 |pages=29–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-femhist/index.html |last=Witt |first=Charlotte |title=Feminist History of Philosophy |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |year=2006 |accessdate=23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;taylor&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Ann Taylor |last1=Allen |year=1999 |title=Feminism, Social Science, and the Meanings of Modernity: The Debate on the Origin of the Family in Europe and the United States, 1860-1914 |journal=The American Historical Review |volume=104 |issue=4 |pages=1085-113 |jstor=2649562 |pmid=19291893}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other historians assert that the term should be limited to the modern feminist movement and its descendants.  Those historians use the label &quot;[[protofeminist]]&quot; to describe earlier movements.&lt;ref name=&quot;botting-houser&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Eileen Hunt |last1=Botting |first2=Sarah L. |last2=Houser |year=2006 |title='Drawing the Line of Equality': Hannah Mather Crocker on Women's Rights |journal=The American Political Science Review |volume=100 |issue=2 |pages=265-78 |jstor=27644349 |doi=10.1017/S0003055406062150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of the modern western feminist movements is divided into three &quot;waves&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Humm&quot;&gt;Humm, Maggie. 1995. The Dictionary of Feminist Theory. Columbus: Ohio State University Press, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker1992&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Walker |first=Rebecca |title=Becoming the Third Wave |journal=Ms. |month=January/February |year=1992 |pages=39–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each wave dealt with different aspects of the same feminist issues. The [[First-wave feminism|first wave]] comprised [[women's suffrage]] movements of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, promoting women's right to vote. The [[Second-wave feminism|second wave]] was associated with the ideas and actions of the [[women's liberation movement]] beginning in the 1960s. The second wave campaigned for legal and social equality for women. The [[Third-wave feminism|third wave]] is a continuation of, and a reaction to, the perceived failures of second-wave feminism, beginning in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suffragettes to Grrls&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Krolokke |first1=Charlotte |first2=Anne Scott |last2=Sorensen |title=Gender Communication Theories and Analyses: From Silence to Performance |year=2005 |publisher=Sage |isbn=0-7619-2918-5 |page=24 |chapter=Three Waves of Feminism: From Suffragettes to Grrls}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nineteenth and early twentieth centuries ===
[[First-wave feminism]] was a period of activity during the nineteenth century and early twentieth century. In the UK and US, it focused on the promotion of equal contract, marriage, parenting, and property rights for women. By the end of the nineteenth century, activism focused primarily on gaining political power, particularly the right of women's [[suffrage]], though some feminists were active in campaigning for women's sexual, [[reproductive rights|reproductive]], and economic rights as well.&lt;ref name=Freedman&gt;{{cite book |author=Freedman, Estelle B. |title=No Turning Back : The History of Feminism and the Future of Women |year=2003 |publisher=Ballantine Books |isbn=0-345-45053-1 |page=464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Louise Weiss.jpg|thumb|right|[[Louise Weiss]] along with other Parisian suffragettes in 1935. The newspaper headline reads &quot;The Frenchwoman Must Vote.&quot;]]
[[Women's suffrage]] was achieved in Britain's [[Australasia]]n colonies at the close of the 19th century, with the self-governing colonies of [[New Zealand]] and South Australia granting women the [[right to vote]] in 1893 and 1895 respectively. It was followed by Australia permitting women to stand for parliamentary office and granting women the right to vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elections.org.nz/study/education-centre/history/votes-for-women.html |title=Votes for Women |publisher=Elections New Zealand |date=13 April 2005 |accessdate=12 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aec.gov.au/Elections/Australian_Electoral_History/milestone.htm |title=Electoral Milestones for Women |publisher=Australian Electoral Commission |date=17 December 2008 |accessdate=12 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] the [[Suffragette]]s and the [[National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies|Suffragists]] campaigned for the women's vote, and in 1918 the [[Representation of the People Act 1918|Representation of the People Act]] was passed granting the vote to women over the age of 30 who owned houses. In 1928 this was extended to all women over twenty-one.&lt;ref name=Phillips&gt;{{cite book |author=Phillips, Melanie |title=The ascent of woman: a history of the suffragette movement and the ideas behind it |year=2004 |publisher=Abacus |location=London |isbn=978-0-349-11660-0}}{{pn|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., notable leaders of this movement included [[Lucretia Mott]], [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], and [[Susan B. Anthony]], who each campaigned for the [[abolitionism|abolition of slavery]] prior to championing women's right to vote. These women were influenced by the [[Quaker]] theology of spiritual equality, which asserts that men and women are equal under God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ruether|first=Rosemary Radford|title=Women and Redemption: A Theological History|publisher=Fortress Press|location=Minneapolis|isbn=0-8006-9816-9|pages=112–118, 136–139|edition=2nd|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, first-wave feminism is considered to have ended with the passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] (1919), granting women the right to vote in all states. The term ''first wave'' was coined retroactively to categorize these western movements after the term ''[[second-wave feminism]]'' began to be used to describe a newer feminist movement that focused as much on fighting social and cultural inequalities as political inequalities.&lt;ref name=Freedman&gt;{{cite book |author=Freedman, Estelle B. |title=No Turning Back : The History of Feminism and the Future of Women |publisher=Ballantine Books |isbn=0-345-45053-1 |page=464}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= DuBois&gt;{{cite book |author=DuBois, Ellen Carol |title=Harriot Stanton Blatch and the Winning of Woman Suffrage |year=1997 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, Conn. |isbn=0-300-06562-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Flexner&gt;{{cite book |last=Flexner |first=Eleanor |title=Century of Struggle: The Woman's Rights Movement in the United States |publisher=The Belknap Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-674-10653-6}}{{pn|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Wheeler&gt;{{cite book |last=Wheeler |first=Marjorie W. |title=One Woman, One Vote: Rediscovering the Woman Suffrage Movement |year=1995 |publisher=NewSage Press |location=Troutdale, OR |isbn=0-939165-26-0}}{{pn|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stevens&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stevens |first1Doris |last2=O'Hare |first2=Carol |title=Jailed for Freedom: American Women Win the Vote |year=1995 |publisher=NewSage Press |location=Troutdale, OR |isbn=0-939165-25-2}}{{pn|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late [[Qing Dynasty|Qing period]] and reform movements such as the [[Hundred Days' Reform]], Chinese feminists called for women's liberation from traditional roles and [[Neo-Confucian]] gender segregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ko |first1=Dorothy |first2=JaHyun Kim |last2=Haboush |first3=Joan R. |last3=Piggott |title=Women and Confucian cultures in premodern China, Korea, and Japan |publisher=University of California Press |year=2003 |isbn=0-520-23138-4}}{{pn|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ma |first1=Yuxin |title=Women journalists and feminism in China, 1898–1937 |publisher=Cambria Press |year=2010 |isbn=1-60497-660-8}}{{pn|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Farris |first1=Catherine S. |first2=Anru |last2=Lee |first3=Murray A. |last3=Rubinstein |title=Women in the new Taiwan: gender roles and gender consciousness in a changing society |publisher=M.E.

In 1899, [[Qasim Amin]], considered the &quot;father&quot; of Arab feminism, wrote ''The Liberation of Women'', which argued for legal and social reforms for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stange |first1=Mary Zeiss |first2=Carol K. |last2=Oyster |first3=Jane E. |last3=Sloan |title=Encyclopedia of Women in Today's World |publisher=SAGE |year=2011 |isbn=1-4129-7685-5}}{{pn|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hoda Shaarawi]] founded the [[Egyptian Feminist Union]] in 1923, and became its president and a symbol of the Arab women's rights movement.

The [[Iranian Constitutional Revolution]] in 1905 triggered the [[Iranian women's movement]], which aimed to achieve women's equality in education, marriage, careers, and legal rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ettehadieh |first=Mansoureh |year=2004 |chapter=The Origins and Development of the Women's Movement in Iran, 1906–41 |chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=tLRgXf_e_CEC&amp;pg=PA85 |pages=85–106 |title=Women in Iran from 1800 to the Islamic Republic |editor1-first=Lois |editor1-last=Beck |editor2-first=Guity |editor2-last=Nashat |publisher=University of Illinois Press |isbn=978-0-252-07189-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the [[Iranian revolution]] of 1979, many of the rights that women had gained from the women's movement were systematically abolished, such as the [[Iran's Family Protection Law|Family Protection Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Chronology of Events Regarding Women in Iran since the Revolution of 1979 |title=Iran since the Revolution |first=Elham |last=Gheytanchi |series=Social Research, Volume 67, No. 2 |year=2000 |editor1-first=Arien |editor1-last=Mack |url=http://www.newschool.edu/centers/socres/vol67/issue672.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, women obtained the [[right to vote]] only with the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic]] of 21 April 1944.&lt;ref name=Bard&gt;{{cite journal |first=Christine |last=Bard |url=http://www.histoire-politique.fr/index.php?numero=01&amp;rub=dossier&amp;item=7 |title=Les premières femmes au Gouvernement (France, 1936–1981) |journal=[[Histoire@Politique]] |volume=1 |month=May–June |year=2007 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Consultative Assembly of Algiers of 1944 proposed on 24 March 1944 to grant eligibility to women but following an amendment by [[Fernand Grenier]], they were given full citizenship, including the right to vote.&lt;ref name=Bard/&gt; Grenier's proposition was adopted 51 to 16.&lt;ref name=Bard/&gt; In May 1947, following the [[French legislative election, November 1946|November 1946 elections]], the sociologist Robert Verdier minimized the &quot;[[gender differences|gender gap]],&quot; stating in ''[[Le Populaire]]'' that women had not voted in a consistent way, dividing themselves, as men, according to social classes.&lt;ref name=Bard/&gt; During the [[Post-World War II baby boom|baby boom]] period, feminism waned in importance.&lt;ref name=Bard/&gt; Wars (both World War I and World War II) had seen the provisional emancipation of some, individual, women, but post-war periods signaled the return to conservative roles.&lt;ref name=Bard/&gt;

=== Mid-twentieth century ===
French philosopher [[Simone de Beauvoir]] provided a [[Marxist]] solution and an [[existentialist]] view on many of the questions of feminism with the publication of ''Le Deuxième Sexe'' ([[The Second Sex]]) in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bergoffen |first=Debra |title=Simone de Beauvoir |date=16 August 2010 |origdate=17 August 2004 |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, CSLI, Stanford University |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/beauvoir/ |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book expressed feminists' sense of injustice.

Second wave feminism is largely concerned with issues of equality other than suffrage, such as ending discrimination.&lt;ref name=Freedman/&gt;

Second-wave feminists see women's cultural and political inequalities as inextricably linked and encourage women to understand aspects of their personal lives as deeply politicized and as reflecting [[sexism|sexist]] power structures. The feminist activist and author [[Carol Hanisch]] coined the slogan &quot;The Personal is Political&quot;, which became synonymous with the second wave.&lt;ref name=Echols/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hanisch&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scholar.alexanderstreet.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=2259 |title=Hanisch, New Intro to 'The Personal is Political' – Second Wave and Beyond |accessdate=8 June 2008 |last=Hanisch |first=Carol |date=1 January 2006 |work=The Personal Is Political |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080515014413/http://scholar.alexanderstreet.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=2259 |archivedate=15 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Second and third-wave feminism in China has been characterized by a re-examination of women's roles during the communist revolution and other reform movements, and new discussions about whether women's equality has actually been fully achieved.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dooling&quot; /&gt;

In 1956, President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] of Egypt initiated &quot;[[state feminism]]&quot;, which outlawed discrimination based on gender and granted women's suffrage, but also blocked political activism by feminist leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Badran |first=Margot |title=Feminists, Islam, and nation: gender and the making of modern Egypt |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1996 |isbn=0-691-02605-X}}{{pn|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During [[Sadat]]'s presidency, his wife, [[Jehan Sadat]], publicly advocated for further women's rights, though Egyptian policy and society began to move away from women's equality with the new [[Islamist]] movement and growing conservatism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Bonnie G. |title=Global feminisms since 1945 |publisher=Psychology Press |year=2000 |isbn=0-415-18491-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some activists proposed a new feminist movement, [[Islamic feminism]], which argues for women's equality within an Islamic framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://feminismeislamic.org/home/ |title=International Congress on Islamic Feminism |accessdate=12 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Latin America, revolutions brought changes in women's status in countries such as [[Role of women in Nicaraguan Revolution|Nicaragua]], where [[feminist ideology during the Sandinista Revolution]] aided women's quality of life but fell short of achieving a social and ideological change.&lt;ref name=&quot;parpart&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Parpart |first=Jane L. |last2=Connelly |first2=M.

=== Late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries ===
In the early 1990s in the USA, [[third-wave feminism]] began as a response to perceived failures of the second wave and to the backlash against initiatives and movements created by the second wave. Third-wave feminism seeks to challenge or avoid what it deems the second wave's [[Essentialism|essentialist]] definitions of [[femininity]], which, they argue, over-emphasize the experiences of upper middle-class white women. Third-wave feminists often focus on &quot;micro-politics&quot; and challenge the second wave's paradigm as to what is, or is not, good for women, and tend to use a [[post-structuralism|post-structuralist]] interpretation of gender and sexuality.&lt;ref name=Freedman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Henry&gt;{{cite book |last=Henry |first=Astrid |title=Not my mother's sister: generational conflict and third-wave feminism |year=2004 |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Bloomington |isbn=978-0-253-21713-4}}{{pn|date=October 2012}}

Since the 1980s [[Standpoint feminism|standpoint feminists]] have argued that the feminist movement should address global issues (such as rape, [[incest]], and prostitution) and culturally specific issues (such as [[female genital mutilation]] in some parts of Africa and the Middle East and [[glass ceiling]] practices that impede women's advancement in developed economies) in order to understand how gender inequality interacts with racism, [[homophobia]], [[classism]] and [[colonization]] in a &quot;matrix of domination.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hill Collins |first=P. |authorlink=Patricia Hill Collins |title=Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness, and the Politics of Empowerment |year=2000 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=978-0-415-92483-2}}{{pn|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Harding2003&gt;{{cite book |last=Harding |first=Sandra |authorlink=Sandra Harding |title=The Feminist Standpoint Theory Reader: Intellectual and Political Controversies |year=2003 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-94501-1 |pages=1–16, 67–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third-wave feminism also contains internal debates between [[difference feminism|difference feminists]], who believe that there are important differences between the sexes, and those who believe that there are no inherent differences between the sexes and contend that gender roles are due to [[social conditioning]].&lt;ref name=Gilligan&gt;{{cite book |last=Gilligan |first=Carol |authorlink=Carol Gilligan |title=In a different voice: psychological theory and women's development |year=1993 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Mass. |isbn=0-674-44544-9 |page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[post-feminism]] is used to describe a range of viewpoints reacting to feminism since the 1980s. While not being &quot;anti-feminist&quot;, post-feminists believe that women have achieved second wave goals while being critical of third wave feminist goals. The term was first used to describe a backlash against [[second-wave feminism]], but it is now a label for a wide range of theories that take critical approaches to previous feminist discourses and includes challenges to the second wave's ideas.&lt;ref name=Wright2000&gt;{{cite book |last=Wright |first=Elizabeth |title=Lacan and Postfeminism (Postmodern Encounters) |year=2000 |publisher=Totem Books |isbn=1-84046-182-9}}{{pn|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other post-feminists say that feminism is no longer relevant to today's society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Modleski |first=Tania |title=Feminism without women: culture and criticism in a 'postfeminist' age |year=1991 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=0-415-90416-1 |page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amelia Jones has written that the post-feminist texts which emerged in the 1980s and 1990s portrayed second-wave feminism as a monolithic entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |first=Amelia |chapter=Postfeminism, Feminist Pleasures, and Embodied Theories of Art |title=New Feminist Criticism: Art, Identity, Action |editor1-first=Joana |editor1-last=Frueh |editor2-first=Cassandra L. |editor2-last=Langer |editor3-first=Arlene |editor3-last=Raven |location=New York |publisher=HarperCollins |year=1994 |pages=16–41, 20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The feminist movement has effected change in Western society, including [[women's suffrage]]; greater access to education; more nearly equitable pay with men; the right to initiate divorce proceedings; the right of women to make individual decisions regarding pregnancy (including access to contraceptives and abortion); and the right to own property.&lt;ref name=&quot;Butler2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Messer-Davidow&quot;/&gt;

From the 1960s on, the campaign for [[women's rights]]&lt;ref name=&quot;quarterly&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author=Lockwood, Bert B. |title=Women's Rights: A Human Rights Quarterly Reader |year=2006 |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=978-0-8018-8374-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; was met with mixed results&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jofreeman.com/feminism/suffrage.htm |title=FROM SUFFRAGE TO WOMEN'S LIBERATION: FEMINISM IN TWENTIETH CENTURY AMERICA by Jo Freeman}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the U.S. and the U.K. Other countries of the [[European Economic Community|EEC]] agreed to ensure that discriminatory laws would be phased out across the European Community.

Some feminist campaigning also helped reform attitudes to [[child sexual abuse]]. The view that young girls cause men to have sexual intercourse with them was replaced by that of men's responsibility for their own conduct, the men being adults.&lt;ref&gt;[[Florence Rush|Rush, Florence]], ''The Best Kept Secret: The Sexual Abuse of Children'' (Prentice Hall, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., the [[National Organization for Women]] ([[National Organization for Women|NOW]]) began in 1966 to seek women's equality, including through the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] ([[Equal Rights Amendment|ERA]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.now.org/history/purpos66.html|title=The National Organization for Women's 1966 Statement of Purpose}}&lt;/ref&gt; which did not pass, although [[Equal Rights Amendment#State constitutions|some states enacted their own]]. [[Reproductive rights]] in the U.S. centered on the court decision in [[Roe v. Wade|''Roe'' v. ''Wade'']] enunciating a woman's right to choose whether to carry a pregnancy to term. Western women gained more reliable [[birth control]], allowing family planning and careers. The movement started in the 1910s in the U.S. under [[Margaret Sanger]] and elsewhere under [[Marie Stopes]]. In the final three decades of the 20th century, Western women knew a new freedom through [[birth control]], which enabled women to plan their adult lives, often making way for both career and family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1676.html|title=Margaret Sanger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[division of labor]] within households was affected by the increased entry of women into workplaces in the 20th century. Sociologist [[Arlie Russell Hochschild]] found that, in two-career couples, men and women, on average, spend about equal amounts of time working, but women still spend more time on housework,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hochschild1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author=Hochschild, Arlie Russell |coauthors=Machung, Anne |title=The Second Shift |year=2003 |publisher=Penguin Books |location=New York  |isbn=978-0-14-200292-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hochschild2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author=Hochschild, Arlie Russell |title=The Time Bind: When Work Becomes Home and Home Becomes Work |year=2001 |publisher=Henry Holt &amp; Co. |location=New York  |isbn=978-0-8050-6643-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; although [[Cathy Young]] responded by arguing that women may prevent equal participation by men in housework and parenting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dir.salon.com/story/mwt/feature/2000/06/12/gatekeeping/index.html |title=The Mama Lion at the Gate |accessdate=8 July 2008 |publisher=Salon.com |author=Young, Cathy |authorlink=Cathy Young}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In international law, the ''[[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]]'' (CEDAW) is an international convention adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] and described as an international [[bill of rights]] for women. It came into force in those nations ratifying it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cedaw.htm |title=Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women New York, 18 December 1979 |publisher=Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|accessdate=6 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Language ===
{{details|Gender-neutral language in English}}
Gender-neutral language is a description of [[Word usage|language usages]] which are aimed at minimizing assumptions regarding the biological sex of human [[reference|referents]]. The advocacy of gender-neutral language reflects, at least, two different agendas: one aims to clarify the ''inclusion'' of both sexes or genders (gender-inclusive language); the other proposes that gender, as a category, is rarely worth marking in language (gender-neutral language). Gender-neutral language is sometimes described as ''non-sexist language'' by advocates and ''politically correct language'' by opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usask.ca/policies/2_03.htm|title=&quot;Gender Neutral Language.&quot; University of Saskatchewan Policies 2001 |accessdate=25 March 2007}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist theology is a movement that reconsiders the traditions, practices, scriptures, and theologies of religions from a feminist perspective. Some of the goals of feminist theology include increasing the role of women among the clergy and religious authorities, reinterpreting male-dominated imagery and language about God, determining women's place in relation to career and motherhood, and studying images of women in the religion's sacred texts.&lt;ref name=Bundesen&gt;{{cite book |author=Bundesen, Lynne |title=The Feminine Spirit: Recapturing the Heart of Scripture |publisher=Jossey-Bass |isbn=978-0-7879-8495-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Christian bible refers to women in authority in Genesis 3:16 and 1 Tim 2:11–13.  

[[Christian feminism]] is a branch of feminist theology which seeks to interpret and understand Christianity in light of the equality of women and men, and that this interpretation is necessary for a complete understanding of Christianity. While there is no standard set of beliefs among Christian feminists, most agree that God does not discriminate on the basis of sex, and are involved in issues such as the [[ordination of women]], male dominance and the balance of parenting in Christian marriage, claims of moral deficiency and inferiority of women compared to men, and the overall treatment of women in the church.&lt;ref name=Haddad&gt;{{cite journal |author=Haddad, Mimi |title=Egalitarian Pioneers: Betty Friedan or Catherine Booth? |journal=Priscilla Papers |year=2007 |volume=20 |date=Autumn 2006 | issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=andeson&gt;{{cite book |author=Anderson, Pamela Sue |coauthors=Clack, Beverley |title=Feminist philosophy of religion: critical readings |year=2004 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=0-415-25749-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islamic feminism|Islamic feminists]] advocate [[women's rights]], [[gender equality]], and social justice grounded within an Islamic framework. Advocates seek to highlight the deeply rooted teachings of equality in the [[Quran]] and encourage a questioning of the patriarchal interpretation of Islamic teaching through the Quran, ''[[hadith]]'' (sayings of [[Muhammad]]), and ''[[sharia]]'' (law) towards the creation of a more equal and just society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2002/569/cu1.htm|title=Al-Ahram Weekly: Islamic feminism: what's in a name? |author=Badran, Margot |accessdate=9 July 2008 |date=17–23 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although rooted in Islam, the movement's pioneers have also utilized secular and Western feminist discourses and recognize the role of Islamic feminism as part of an integrated global feminist movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feminismeislamic.org/eng/index.htm|publisher=feminismeislamic.org |author=Catalonian Islamic Board |title=II International Congress on Islamic Feminism|accessdate=9 July 2008 |date=24–27 October 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080509121200/http://www.feminismeislamic.org/eng/index.htm &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=9 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jewish feminism]] is a movement that seeks to improve the religious, legal, and social status of women within Judaism and to open up new opportunities for religious experience and leadership for Jewish women. The main issues for early Jewish feminists in these movements were the exclusion from the all-male prayer group or ''[[minyan]]'', the exemption from positive time-bound ''[[Mitzvah|mitzvot]]'', and women's inability to function as witnesses and to initiate [[Jewish view of marriage#Divorce|divorce]].&lt;ref name=Plaskow1997&gt;{{cite book |author=Plaskow, Judith |editor=Frank, Daniel H. |others=Leaman, Oliver |title=History of Jewish philosophy |year=2003 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=0-415-32469-6 |chapter=Jewish Feminist Thought}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Secular or [[atheist feminism|atheist feminists]] have engaged in feminist criticism of religion, arguing that many religions have oppressive rules towards women and [[misogynistic]] themes and elements in religious texts.&lt;ref&gt;Gaylor, Annie Laurie, ''Woe To The Women: The Bible Tells Me So'', Freedom From Religion Foundation, Inc.

=== Patriarchy ===
{{main|Patriarchy}}
Patriarchy is a social system in which the role of the male as the primary authority figure is central to social organization, and where fathers hold authority over women, children, and property. It implies the institutions of male rule and privilege, and is dependent on female subordination.&lt;ref&gt;''MacMillan Encyclopedia of Sex and Gender'' p. 1104.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most forms of feminism characterize patriarchy as an unjust social system that is [[oppression|oppressive]] to women. As the feminist and political theorist [[Carole Pateman]] writes: &quot;The patriarchal construction of the difference between masculinity and femininity is the political difference between freedom and subjection.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pateman, Carole (1988). ''The Sexual Contract'', Stanford: Stanford University Press, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[feminist theory]] the concept of patriarchy often includes all the social mechanisms that reproduce and exert male dominance over women. Feminist theory typically characterizes patriarchy as a social construction, which can be overcome by revealing and critically analyzing its manifestations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tickner, Ann J.|chapter=Patriarchy|title=Routledge Encyclopedia of International Political Economy: Entries P-Z|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2001|isbn=978-0-415-24352-0|pages=1197–1198|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lSmU3aXWIAYC&amp;pg=PA1197}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some [[radical feminism|radical feminists]] have proposed that because patriarchy is too deeply rooted in society, [[Separatist feminism|separatism]] is the only viable solution.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Hoagland, Lesbian Ethics: toward new value&lt;/ref&gt; Other feminists have criticized these radical feminist views as being anti-men, though some radical feminists reject this portrayal of their views.&lt;ref&gt;Friedan, Betty.

Interview with Cindy Cisler.&quot;) and see p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Societal tension caused by second-wave feminism gave rise to backlash in the form of anti-feminist men's movements, such as [[Masculism]], though today some see masculism as a complementary movement that does not oppose feminism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gardiner&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Honderich, Ted, ''The Oxford companion to philosophy',' Oxford University Press, 1995, ISBN 0-19-866132-0&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Men and masculinity ===
{{main|Men and feminism}}
Feminist theory has explored the social construction of masculinity and its implications for the goal of gender equality. The social construct of masculinity is seen by feminism as problematic because it associates males with aggression and competition, and reinforces [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] and unequal gender relations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Faludi&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tong |first=Rosemarie Putnam |title=Feminist Thought: A More Comprehensive Introduction |location=Boulder, Colo. |publisher=Westview Press |edition=2nd |year=1998 |isbn=0-8133-3295-8 |page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; The patriarchal concept of masculinity is also seen as harmful to men by narrowing their life choices, limiting their sexuality, and blocking full emotional connections with women and other men.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gardiner&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gardiner |first1=Judith Kegan |title=Masculinity studies and feminist theory |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=2002 |isbn=0-231-12278-0}}{{pn|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some feminists are engaged with men's issues activism, such as bringing attention to male rape and spousal battery and addressing negative social expectations for men.&lt;ref&gt;Harv.

Rev., 1995 – works.bepress.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Male participation in feminism is encouraged by feminists and is seen as an important strategy for achieving full societal commitment to gender equality.&lt;ref name=&quot;hooks&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Digby, Tom (1998). Men Doing Feminism. New York: Routledge. ISBN 978-0-415-91625-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Layli, ''The Womanist reader'', CRC Press, 2006, ISBN 0-415-95411-8&lt;/ref&gt; Many male feminists and pro-feminists are active in both women's rights activism, feminist theory, and masculinity studies. However, some argue that while male engagement with feminism is necessary, it is problematic due to the ingrained social influences of patriarchy in gender relations.&lt;ref&gt;Jardine, Alice, Paul Smith, ''Men in feminism '', ISBN 0-415-90251-7&lt;/ref&gt; The consensus today in feminist and masculinity theories is that both genders can and should cooperate to achieve the larger goals of feminism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gardiner&quot; /&gt;

== Reactions ==
Different groups of people have responded to feminism, and both men and women have been among its supporters and critics. Among American university students, for both men and women, support for feminist ideas is more common than self-identification as a feminist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.2004.00159.x |title=Disavowing Social Identities: What It Means when Women Say, 'I'm Not a Feminist, but…' |year=2004 |last1=Zucker |first1=Alyssa N. |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=423–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1023/A:1007044802798 |year=2000 |last1=Burn |first1=Shawn Meghan |last2=Aboud |first2=Roger |last3=Moyles |first3=Carey |journal=Sex Roles |volume=42 |issue=11/12 |pages=1081–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF00289954 |title=New wave or second stage?

=== Pro-feminism ===
{{main|Pro-feminism}}
Pro-feminism is the support of feminism without implying that the supporter is a member of the feminist movement. The term is most often used in reference to men who are actively supportive of feminism. The activities of pro-feminist men's groups include anti-violence work with boys and young men in schools, offering [[sexual harassment]] workshops in workplaces, running community education campaigns, and counseling male perpetrators of violence. Pro-feminist men also are involved in men's health, activism against pornography including anti-pornography legislation, [[men's studies]], and the development of [[gender equality|gender equity]] curricula in schools. This work is sometimes in collaboration with feminists and women's services, such as domestic violence and rape crisis centers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lingard-isbnX-p192&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Lingard |first1=Bob |last2=Douglas |first2=Peter |title=Men Engaging Feminisms: Pro-Feminism, Backlashes and Schooling |year=1999 |publisher=Open University Press |location=Buckingham, England |isbn=0-335-19818-X |page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kimmel-Tide&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Kimmel |first2=Thomas E. |authorlink1=Michael Kimmel |last2=Mosmiller |title=Against the Tide: Pro-Feminist Men in the United States, 1776–1990: A Documentary History |year=1992 |publisher=Beacon Press |location=Boston |isbn=978-0-8070-6767-3}}{{pn|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anti-feminism ===
{{main|Anti-feminism}}
Anti-feminism is opposition to feminism in some or all of its forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50009621/50009621se1 |chapter=Anti-feminist |title=The Oxford English Dictionary |edition=2nd |year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the nineteenth century, anti-feminism was mainly focused on opposition to women's suffrage. Later, opponents of women's entry into institutions of higher learning argued that education was too great a physical burden on women. Other anti-feminists opposed women's entry into the labor force, or their right to join unions, to sit on juries, or to obtain birth control and control of their sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kimmel |first1=Michael |year=2004 |chapter=Antifeminism |editor1-last=Kimmel |editor1-first=Michael |location=Santa Barbara |publisher=ABC-CLIO |pages=35–7 |title=Men and Masculinities: A Social, Cultural, and Historical Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people have opposed feminism on the grounds that they believe it is contrary to traditional values or religious beliefs. These anti-feminists argue, for example, that social acceptance of divorce and non-married women is wrong and harmful, and that men and women are fundamentally different and thus their different traditional roles in society should be maintained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Carrie L. |last1=Lukas |title=The politically incorrect guide to women, sex, and feminism |publisher=Regnery Publishing |year=2006 |isbn=1-59698-003-6}}{{pn|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Mary A. |last1=Kassian |title=The feminist mistake: the radical impact of feminism on church and culture |publisher=Crossway |year=2005 |isbn=1-58134-570-4}}{{pn|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schlafly |first1=Phyllis |year=1977 |title=The Power of the Positive Woman |location=New York |publisher=Arlington House Publishers}}{{pn|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other anti-feminists oppose women's entry into the workforce, political office, and the voting process, as well as the lessening of male authority in families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gottfried |first=Paul |year=2001 |title=The Trouble With Feminism |publisher=Lew Rockwell |url=http://www.lewrockwell.com/gottfried/gottfried9.html |accessdate=30 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Calvert |first=John |title=Islamism: a documentary and reference |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=2008 |isbn=0313338566}}{{pn|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writers such as [[Camille Paglia]], [[Christina Hoff Sommers]], [[Jean Bethke Elshtain]], [[Elizabeth Fox-Genovese]] and [[Daphne Patai]] oppose some forms of feminism, though they identify as feminists. They argue, for example, that feminism  often promotes misandry and the elevation of women's interests above men's, and criticize radical feminist positions as harmful to both men and women.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoff_Sommers&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Sommers |first=Christina Hoff |authorlink=Christina Hoff Sommers |title=Who Stole Feminism?: How Women Have Betrayed Women |year=1995 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |isbn=0-684-80156-6 |page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daphne Patai]] and Noretta Koertge argue that the term &quot;anti-feminist&quot; is used to silence academic debate about feminism.&lt;ref name=Patai_Koertge&gt;{{cite book |last=Patai |first=Daphne |coauthors=Noretta Koertge |title=Professing Feminism: Education and Indoctrination in Women's Studies |isbn=0-7391-0455-1}}{{pn|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
