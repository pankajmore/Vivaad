A '''culture war''' (or '''culture wars''') is a struggle between two sets of conflicting cultural values.

==Origins==
'''Culture war''' is a loan translation ([[calque]]) from the German ''[[Kulturkampf]].'' The German term, Kulturkampf, was coined to describe the clash between cultural and religious groups in the campaign from 1871 to 1878 under [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|Chancellor]] [[Otto von Bismarck]] of the [[German Empire]] against the influence of the [[Roman Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin Spahn, &quot;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08703b.htm Kulturkampf]&quot;, ''[[The Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', volume 8, [[Robert Appleton Company]], 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; The term cultural war has been in English use almost as long as the original Kulturkampf and generalizes the idea of these kinds of struggle. It is related then to the theory of cultural hegemony.

Italian [[Marxist]] [[Antonio Gramsci]] presented in the 1920s a theory of [[cultural hegemony]] to explain the slower advance, compared to many Marxists' expectations, of [[proletarian revolution]] in Europe. He stated that a culturally diverse society can be dominated by one class who has a monopoly over the mass media and popular culture, and Gramsci argued for a culture war in which [[anti-capitalist]] elements seek to gain a dominant voice in the [[mass media]], education, and other mass institutions.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

==United States of America==
In [[United States|American]] usage the term ''culture war'' is used to claim that there is a conflict between those values considered [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalist]] or [[Conservativism in the United States|conservative]] and those considered [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] or [[socialist]]. It originated in the 1920s when urban and rural American values came into clear conflict. This followed several decades of immigration to the cities by people considered alien to earlier immigrants. It was also a result of the cultural shifts and modernizing trends of the [[Roaring 20s]], culminating in the presidential campaign of [[Al Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.assumption.edu/users/McClymer/his394/ Seminar on the Culture Wars of the 1920s]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2008/03/reclaiming_faith_and_politics.html &quot;Culture Wars: How 2004&quot; Article by [[E.J. Dionne]]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, &quot;The Culture War&quot; in United States of America was redefined by James Davison Hunter's 1991 book ''Culture Wars: The Struggle to Define America.'' In this work, it is traced to the 1960s. The perceived focus of the American Culture War and its definition have taken various forms since then.

===1980s===
In the 1980s the culture war in America was characterized by the conservative climate during the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cengage96&quot;&gt;''[http://www.enotes.com/1980-arts-american-decades/culture-wars Culture Wars]'', 1980s The Arts. Gale Cengage, 1996. eNotes.com. 2006. 2 Mar, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the [[religious right]] often criticized academics and &quot;artists&quot;, and their works, in a struggle against what they considered indecent, [[Subversion|subversive]], and [[Blasphemy|blasphemous]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cengage96&quot;/&gt; They often accused their political opponents of undermining [[Traditionalist conservatism|tradition]], [[Western civilization]]&lt;ref name=&quot;NationObituaries&quot;&gt;Ross Benjamin ''[http://www.thenation.com/doc/20041213/benjamin Hostile Obituary for Derrida]'', [[The Nation]], November 24, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and [[family values]].

===1990s===
The expression was introduced again by the 1991 publication of ''Culture Wars: The Struggle to Define America'' by [[James Davison Hunter]], a [[sociologist]] at the [[University of Virginia]]. Hunter described what he saw as a dramatic realignment and polarization that had transformed [[politics of the United States|American politics]] and [[American culture|culture]].

He argued that on an increasing number of &quot;hot-button&quot; defining issues &amp;mdash; [[abortion]], [[gun politics]], [[separation of church and state]], [[privacy]], [[recreational drug use]], [[homosexuality]], [[censorship]] issues &amp;mdash; there existed two definable polarities. Furthermore, not only were there a number of divisive issues, but society had divided along essentially the same lines on these issues, so as to constitute two warring groups, defined primarily not by nominal religion, ethnicity, social class, or even political affiliation, but rather by ideological [[world view]]s.

Hunter characterized this polarity as stemming from opposite impulses, toward what he referred to as ''Progressivism'' and ''Orthodoxy''. Others have adopted the dichotomy with varying labels. For example, [[Fox News]] commentator [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] emphasizes differences between &quot;Secular-Progressives&quot; and &quot;Traditionalists.&quot;

[[File:Patrickjbuchanan.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Patrick Buchanan, pictured in 2008.]]

In 1990 commentator [[Pat Buchanan]] mounted a campaign for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nomination for [[President of the United States]] against incumbent [[George H. W. Bush]] in [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992]]. He received a prime time speech slot at the [[1992 Republican National Convention]], which is sometimes dubbed the &quot;'culture war' speech.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; &quot;Not since Pat Buchanan's famous &quot;culture war&quot; speech in 1992 has a major speaker at a national political convention spoken so hatefully, at such length, about the opposition.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; During his speech, he claimed: &quot;There is a religious war going on in our country for the soul of America. It is a cultural war, as critical to the kind of nation we will one day be as was the Cold War itself.&quot; [http://www.buchanan.org/pa-92-0817-rnc.html] In addition to criticizing &quot;environmental extremists&quot; and &quot;radical feminism,&quot; he said [[public morality]] was a [[defining issue]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The agenda [Bill] Clinton and [Hillary] Clinton would impose on America &amp;mdash; abortion on demand, a [[Litmus test (politics)|litmus test]] for the Supreme Court, homosexual rights, discrimination against religious schools, women in combat &amp;mdash; that's change, all right. But it is not the kind of change America wants. It is not the kind of change America needs. And it is not the kind of change we can tolerate in a nation that we still call God's country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|authorlink = Patrick Buchanan| first=Patrick | last=Buchanan | title=1992 Republican National Convention Speech | date=1992-08-17 | publisher= | url =http://www.buchanan.org/pa-92-0817-rnc.html | accessdate = 2007-11-03 | language = |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071018035401/http://www.buchanan.org/pa-92-0817-rnc.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A month later, Buchanan said that the conflict was about power over society's definition of right and wrong. He named abortion, sexual orientation and popular culture as major fronts – and mentioned other controversies, including clashes over the [[Confederate Flag]], Christmas and taxpayer-funded art. He also said that the negative attention his &quot;culture war&quot; speech received was itself evidence of America’s polarization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buchanan.org/pa-92-0914.html The Cultural War for the Soul of America - by Pat Buchanan - Articles, Essays and Speeches - T H E I N T E R N E T B R I G A D E - Official Web Site&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

When Buchanan ran for President in 1996, he promised to fight for the conservative side of the culture war:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I will use the [[bully pulpit]] of the Presidency of the United States, to the full extent of my power and ability, to defend American traditions and the values of faith, family, and country, from any and all directions. And, together, we will chase the purveyors of sex and violence back beneath the rocks whence they came.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.4president.org/speeches/buchanan1996announcement.htm Announcement Speech by Patrick J&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Culture war disputes are considered by many to have had significant impacts on national politics in the United States in the 1990s. Some say extreme conservative rhetoric of the [[Christian Coalition]] hurt then-president [[George H.W. Bush]]'s chances for reelection in 1992 and helped his successor, [[Bill Clinton]], win reelection in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chapman|first=Roger|title=Culture Wars: An Encyclopedia of Issues, Viewpoints, and Voices|year=2010|publisher=M.E.

The culture wars influenced the debate over public school history curricula in the United States in the 1990s. In particular, debates over the development of national educational standards in 1994 revolved around whether the study of American history should be a &quot;celebratory&quot; or &quot;critical&quot; undertaking and involved such prominent public figures as [[Lynne Cheney]], [[Rush Limbaugh]], and historian [[Gary Nash]].&lt;ref&gt;Eric Foner, &quot;Who Owns History: Rethinking the Past in a Changing World&quot;. New York: Hill &amp; Wang, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gary B. Nash, Crabtree, Charlotte, and Ross E. Dunn, &quot;History on Trial: Culture Wars and the Teaching of the Past&quot;. New York: Knopf, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s===
In a 2004 column, Pat Buchanan said the culture war had reignited and that certain groups of Americans no longer inhabited the same moral universe. He gave such examples as same-sex [[civil union]]s, the &quot;crudity of the MTV crowd,&quot; and the controversy surrounding [[Mel Gibson|Mel Gibson's]] film ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]''. He wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Who is in your face here? Who started this? Who is on the offensive? Who is pushing the envelope? The answer is obvious. A radical Left aided by a cultural elite that detests Christianity and finds Christian moral tenets reactionary and repressive is hell-bent on pushing its amoral values and imposing its ideology on our nation.
The unwisdom of what the Hollywood and the Left are about should be transparent to all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theamericancause.org/patculturewars.htm|title=The Aggressors in the Culture Wars|date=March 8, 2004|accessdate=January 26, 2009|author=[[Pat Buchanan]]|publisher=[http://www.theamericancause.org/ theamericancause.org]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Peter Beinart]], best known as a senior fellow of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], argued in a January 2009 column for ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' that the new [[United States presidential election, 2008|election of Barack Obama as President]] could be the beginning of the end for the American culture war. He wrote:
{{quote|When it comes to culture, Obama doesn’t have a public agenda; he has a public anti-agenda. He wants to remove culture from the political debate. He wants to cut our three-sided political game back down to two.... Barack Obama was more successful than John Kerry in reaching out to moderate white evangelicals in part because he struck them as more authentically Christian. That’s the foundation on which Obama now seeks to build. He seems to think there are large numbers of conservative white Protestants and Catholics who will look beyond culture when they enter the voting booth as long as he and other Democrats don’t ram cultural liberalism down their throats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2009-01-26/the-end-of-the-culture-wars/|author=[[Peter Beinart]]|publisher=''[[The Daily Beast]]''|accessdate=January 5, 2010|title=The End of the Culture Wars|date=January 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

In response, author and writer [[Rod Dreher]] stated in a [[RealClearPolitics]] column that the rhetoric of a culture war disguises the fact that American society truly is deeply divided on some moral issues, which is not an artificial creation of political parties seeking to drum up support. He wrote that the economic positions of the Democratic Party are generally popular enough that, if it chose to drop polarizing social issues, it would become a majority party in ongoing control. He describes the culture war as &quot;inevitable.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2009/02/obama_wont_end_the_culture_war.html|publisher=[[RealClearPolitics]]|author=[[Rod Dreher]]|date=February 16, 2009|title=Obama Won't End the Culture Wars|accessdate=January 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Columnist [[Ross Douthat]], then with ''[[The Atlantic]]'', wrote that he had &quot;a lot to agree with&quot; [[Peter Beinart|Beinart]], but he stated that what Obama and his supporters seem to be doing is &quot;winning&quot; the culture wars for their side rather than coming to some kind of compromise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=''[[The Atlantic]]''|author=[[Ross Douthat]]|date=January 28, 2009|title=Ending or Winning?|url=http://rossdouthat.theatlantic.com/archives/2009/01/ending_or_winning.php|accessdate=January 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a February 2009 column in ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[William Saletan]] stated that a holistic mix of left-wing and right-wing ideas would come out of the culture war. He wrote, &quot;morality has to be practical, and that practicality requires morals.&quot; He concluded that conservatives should embrace [[family planning]] as a way to reduce abortion and government assistance while liberals should embrace personal responsibility, which means that unprotected sex is criticized &quot;bluntly.&quot; He also advocated same sex marriage as a way to lead LGBT Americans to an &quot;ethic of mutual support and sacrifice&quot; involving stricter personal responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=February 21, 2009|accessdate=January 5, 2010|author=[[William Saletan]]|title=This Is the Way the Culture Wars End|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/22/opinion/22saletan.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
&quot;Culture war&quot; (or &quot;culture wars&quot;) in [[Canada]] describes the polarization between the different values of Canadians. This can be [[Western Canada|West]] versus [[Eastern Canada|East]], [[Rural Canada|rural]] versus [[List of the 100 largest urban areas in Canada by population|urban]], or [[Conservatism in Canada|traditional values]] versus [[Progressivism in Canada|progressive values]]. &quot;Culture war&quot; is a relatively new phrase in Canadian political commentary. It can still be used to describe historical events in Canada, such as the [[Rebellions of 1837]], [[Western Alienation]], [[Quebec sovereignty movement]], and any [[:Category:Aboriginal conflicts in Canada|Aboriginal conflicts in Canada]], but is more relevant to current events such as the [[Grand River land dispute|Caledonia conflict with Natives]] and the increasing hostility between conservative and liberal Canadians. Its use has increased considerably recently on account of [[Prorogation_in_Canada|prorogation]] rallies, abortion, and the gun registry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thechronicleherald.ca/books/100850-richler-on-front-line-of-culture-war Canadian Culture War]&lt;/ref&gt;
