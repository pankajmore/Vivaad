      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7949">'''Richard Girnt Butler''' (February 23, 1918 &amp;ndash; September 8, 2004) was an [[United States|American]] [[Aerospace engineering|aerospace engineer]] for [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], who later became the leader of the [[Christian Identity]] [[White supremacy|white supremacist]] group [[Aryan Nations]].

==Biography==
Butler was born in [[Denver, Colorado]], to Winfred Girnt and Clarence Butler. His father was of [[English people|English]] ancestry, while his mother was of [[German people|German]] ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nndb.com/people/811/000060631 Richard G. Butler (Biography)]&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised in [[Los Angeles, California]], and after graduating from high school in 1938, he became an [[aeronautical engineering]] major at [[Los Angeles City College]]. He was a co-inventor of the rapid repair of [[tubeless tire]]s, for which he held both U.S. and Canadian patents.&lt;ref&gt;
{{US Patent|2990736}} Tire Repair Device, Butler, Richard G. and Specmade Products, issued July 4, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;

Butler was a former member of the [[Silver Shirts]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mountainx.com/article/11589/New-Age-Nazi&lt;/ref&gt;

While he was a member of a Presbyterian church he married Betty Litch in 1941, with whom he fathered two daughters.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYtimes&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50D1EF93C540C7A8CDDA00894DC404482 | title=Richard G. Butler, 86, Dies; Founder of the Aryan Nations | publisher=[[New York Times]] |date= September 9, 2004 | first= Daniel J.| last=  Wakin| accessdate =2007-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Litch died on December 1, 1995 after 54 years of marriage. After Pearl Harbor, Butler enlisted in the Army Air Corps where he served stateside for the duration of World War II.

In 1946, Butler organized and operated a machine plant for the production and precision machining of automotive parts and engine assemblies for commercial and military aircraft in the United States, Africa, and India.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYtimes&quot; /&gt; Butler was a marketing analyst for new inventions from 1964 through 1973. Butler later became a senior manufacturing engineer for [[Lockheed Martin]] in [[Palmdale, California]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NYtimes&quot; /&gt;

In the early 1970s, he moved with his family from Palmdale, California, to [[North Idaho]], where he founded the [[Aryan Nations]], also known as the [[Church of Jesus Christ–Christian]], whose ideology is a mixture of [[Christian Identity]] and [[Nazism]]. The organization operated from a {{convert|20|acre|m2|sing=on}} compound in [[Hayden Lake, Idaho]], a suburb of tourist town [[Coeur d'Alene, Idaho]], which became the center of a U.S. neo-Nazi network with worldwide links. Butler was implicated in plots to overthrow the United States government beginning in the 1980s, and had ties to the neo-Nazi group known as [[The Order (group)|The Order]]. His group often blanketed the community with fliers and mass mailings, and held an annual parade in downtown Coeur d'Alene, however the parade was a pariah since the Aryan Nations was condemned by the town of Coeur d'Alene. Locals responded almost immediately by forming the Kootenai County Task Force on Human Relations, with legal battles often overshadowing the parades.

Butler organized yearly gatherings of white supremacists at his compound in Idaho which he termed the &quot;Aryan Nations World Congress.&quot;  At their height in 1984-86, several hundred people would attend including most of the well known leaders of the American far right, such as [[Klansman]] [[Louis Beam]], [[White Aryan Resistance]] leader [[Tom Metzger (white supremacist)|Tom Metzger]], [[Gordon &quot;Jack&quot; Mohr]], [[Robert E. Miles]], [[Posse Comitatus]] leader [[James Wickstrom]], [[Thomas Robb]], [[Grand Wizard]] [[Don Black (white nationalist)|Don Black]], and [[John Trochmann]] leader of the [[Militia of Montana]].

In 1987, Butler was among fourteen far right activists &quot;indicted for [[Sedition|seditious]] [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]]&quot; by the U.S. Department of Justice,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/beam.asp Biography of &quot;Louis Beam&quot; at Anti-Defamation League (ADL) website.]&lt;/ref&gt; and trial was held in federal court in Arkansas. However, &quot;prosecutors failed to convince an Arkansas jury that Butler and several other prominent racists had conspired to start a race war.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/09/09/obit.butler/index.html | title=Aryan Nations founder dies at 86 | publisher=[[CNN]] |date= September 9, 2004 | first= | last=  | accessdate =2007-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2000, Victoria and Jason Keenan, two Native Americans who were harassed at gunpoint by Aryan Nations' members, successfully sued Butler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/LAW/09/08/morris.dees.profile/ | title=Attorney Morris Dees pioneer in using 'damage litigation' to fight hate groups | publisher=[[CNN]] |date= September 8, 2000 | first= | last=  | accessdate =2007-08-17 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071008010401/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/LAW/09/08/morris.dees.profile/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Represented by local attorney Norm Gissel and [[Morris Dees]]'s [[Montgomery, Alabama]]-based [[Southern Poverty Law Center]], they won a combined civil judgment of $6.3 million from Butler and the Aryan Nations' members who attacked them.&lt;ref name=&quot;AryanNations&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.splcenter.org/legal/docket/files.jsp?cdrID=30&amp;sortID=0 | title=Keenan v. Aryan Nations | publisher=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]] |year= 2000 | first= | last=  | accessdate =2007-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Butler then sold the compound. In September 2000, fellow [[Sandpoint, Idaho]] millionaire [[Vincent Bertollini]] provided Butler with a new house in [[Hayden, Idaho]]. The house was troublesome for neighbors; police were forced to respond to at least one domestic disturbance call, in which two Aryan Nation members were engaged in an altercation on his lawn.

From late 2003 until his death, his reputation within the Aryan Nations suffered; when Butler and his traveling companion attempted to board a plane at a [[Spokane, Washington]] airport, his companion, who turned out to be porn star Bianca Trump (famous for her explicit, interracial sex scenes), was arrested on an outstanding forgery warrant.&lt;ref name=&quot;TrumpNations&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2003/winter/the-company-he-keeps | title=The Company He Keeps | publisher=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]] |date= Winter 2003 | first= | last=  | accessdate =2007-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Butler died in his home on September 8, 2004. A spokesman for the Aryan Nation stated that he died in his sleep from congestive heart failure. At the time of his death, the Aryan Nations had 200 members, Butler's World Congress in 2002 drew less than 100 people, and when he ran for mayor, he lost by about 2,100 votes to 50.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYtimes&quot; /&gt;
