'''Jimmy Lee Swaggart''' (born March 15, 1935) is an American [[Pentecostal]] pastor, teacher, musician, author, television host, and [[televangelist]]. He has preached to crowds around the world  through his weekly telecast. According to the official website for Jimmy Swaggart Ministries, his 1980s telecast was transmitted to over 3,000 stations and cable systems each week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsm.org |title=Jimmy Swaggart Ministries |publisher=Jsm.org |date= |accessdate=March 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual scandals in the late 1980s and early 1990's led the [[General Council of the Assemblies of God in the United States of America|Assemblies of God]] to defrock him, and to his temporarily stepping down as the head of Jimmy Swaggart Ministries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of American religion and politics |last=Djupe |first=Paul A. |coauthors=Olson, Laura R. |year=2008 |publisher=Checkmark Books |isbn=978-0-8160-7555-3 |page=430 |url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=frt7RDOT1PUC&amp;pg=PA430&amp;dq=jimmy+swaggart+prostitute#v=onepage&amp;q=jimmy%20swaggart%20prostitute&amp;f=false |accessdate=March 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swaggart's television ministry, which began in 1975, continues airing nationally and internationally. The weekly ''Jimmy Swaggart Telecast'' and ''A Study in the Word'' programs are seen nationwide and abroad on 78 channels in 104 countries as well as live over the Internet.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Early life==
Swaggart was born in [[Ferriday, Louisiana]], to Willie Leon (a.k.a., &quot;Son&quot;) and Minnie Belle ({{née}} Herron) Swaggart. He is the cousin of [[rock'n'roll]] pioneer [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] and [[country music]] star [[Mickey Gilley]]. With his parents, Swaggart attended a small, 25-member Assemblies of God church in Ferriday. At the age of nine, he began to preach on street corners and lead congregations in singing.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} On October 10, 1952, Swaggart married Frances Anderson. Their son, Donnie, was born in 1954. Swaggart worked several part-time odd jobs in order to support his young family and also began singing [[Southern Gospel]] music at various [[Baptist]] and [[Pentecostal]] churches.

According to his biography, Swaggart, along with his wife and son, lived in poverty during the 1950s as he preached throughout rural [[Louisiana]], struggling to survive on US$30 a week. Being too poor to own a home, the Swaggarts lived in church basements, pastors' homes, and small motels. [[Sun Records]] producer [[Sam Phillips]] wanted to start [[Gospel music|gospel]] line of music for the label (undoubtedly to remain in competition with [[RCA Records|RCA Victor]] and [[Columbia Records|Columbia]], who also had gospel lines) and wanted Swaggart for Sun as the label's first gospel artist. Swaggart's cousin Jerry Lee Lewis, who had previously signed with Sun, was reportedly making $20,000 per week at the time. Although the offer meant a promise for significant income for him and his family, Swaggart turned Phillips down, stating that he was called to preach the gospel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=To cross a river|year=1984|publisher=Jimmy Swaggart Ministries|location=Baton Rouge, La.|isbn=978-0-88270-221-6|author=Jimmy Swaggart|edition=3rd ed.|coauthors=Robert Paul Lamb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ordination and early career==
Preaching from a flatbed trailer donated to him, Swaggart began full-time evangelistic work in 1955.  It was then that Swaggart began developing a revival-meeting following throughout the American South. Swaggart began attending Bible college in 1957.  In 1960, he began recording gospel music record albums while building up another audience via Christian radio stations. In 1961, after graduating from Bible college, Swaggart was ordained by the Assemblies of God; one year later, Swaggart began his radio ministry. By 1969, Swaggart's radio program, ''The Camp Meeting Hour'', was being aired over numerous radio stations throughout the American [[Bible Belt]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  In the late 1960s, Swaggart founded what was then a small church named the Family Worship Center in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]]; the church eventually became district-affiliated with the Assemblies of God. The Family Worship Center grew from barely 40 members in 1970 to over 500 by 1975 and over 1000 by 1980.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} During the 1970s the church grew from a one room church to a more modern building with new additions being built every couple years.

In the late 1960s, Swaggart began airing a weekly 30-minute telecast over various local television stations in that city and also purchased a local AM radio station, WLUX in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]] (now [[WPFC (AM)|WPFC]]). The station broadcast Christian feature stories, preaching and teaching from various [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] and Pentecostal denominations and played a blend of [[Traditional black gospel|black gospel]], [[Southern gospel]], and inspirational music. As [[Contemporary Christian music]] became more prevalent, the station avoided playing it. Swaggart would ultimately sell his radio stations gradually throughout the 1980s and early 1990s.

==Shifting to television==
By 1975, Swaggart's television ministry had expanded to more stations around the US; it was at this time that he decided to use television as his primary preaching venue. In 1978, Swaggart's weekly telecast was expanded to an hour.

In 1980, Swaggart began a daily weekday telecast featuring Bible study and music while the weekend, hour-long telecast would feature a service from either Family Worship Center (Swaggart's church) or an on-location crusade in a major city. In the early 1980s, Swaggart's crusades expanded to major cities nationwide. By 1983, more than 250 television stations featured Swaggart's telecast.  As a result, it was claimed that multitudes of people around the world were converted to Christianity, 'receiving Jesus Christ as their Lord.'

==Controversies, scandals and criticisms==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2009}}
In 1988, Swaggart was implicated in a sex scandal involving a prostitute that resulted initially in his suspension and ultimately Swaggart was [[defrocked]] and removed from the ministry by the Assemblies of God. Three years later, Swaggart was again implicated in a sex scandal involving a prostitute. As a result, Swaggart's current ministry is non-affiliated, non-denominational and significantly smaller than it was in the ministry's pre-scandal years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of American religion and politics |last=Djupe |first=Paul A. |coauthors=Olson, Laura R. |year=2008 |publisher=Checkmark Books |isbn=978-0-8160-7555-3 |page=430 |url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=frt7RDOT1PUC&amp;pg=PA430&amp;dq=jimmy+swaggart+prostitute#v=onepage&amp;q=jimmy%20swaggart%20prostitute&amp;f=false |accessdate=March 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1988 scandal===
====Background====
Swaggart's exposure came as retaliation for an incident in 1986 when Swaggart exposed fellow Assemblies of God minister Marvin Gorman, who had been accused of having several affairs. &lt;!-- [commenting out unsourced and potentially libelous sentence] --&gt; &lt;!-- [commented out speculative and unsourced sentence] --&gt;Once exposed, Gorman was defrocked from the Assemblies of God, his ministry all but ended. As a retaliatory move, Gorman hired his son Randy and son-in-law Garland Bilbo to stake out the [[Travel Inn]] on Airline Highway in [[New Orleans]]. A camera with a [[telephoto lens]] was placed in the window of the motel's Room 12 and draped with a black cloth. When Swaggart arrived, he reportedly went into Room 7. Randy Gorman and Garland Bilbo proceeded to let the air out of Swaggart's tires and called Marvin Gorman, whose church was located nearby. The two had taken photos of Swaggart outside of Room 7 with [[Debra Murphree]], a local prostitute. Gorman showed up at the Travel Inn a short while later and asked Swaggart what he was doing there.

According to, ''Swaggart: The Unauthorized Biography of an American Evangelist'' by Ann Rowe Seaman, Gorman secured a promise from Swaggart that he would publicly apologize to Gorman and start the process of Gorman's reinstatement to the Assemblies of God. &lt;!-- [commented out private detective- it was his son in law] --&gt; &lt;!-- [commented out &quot;and took pictures of the tyrst- he took pictures of Swaggart outside the hotel room] --&gt; Gorman offered to remain silent if Swaggart would state publicly that he lied about Gorman's affairs. Gorman waited almost a year, then hand delivered a note to Swaggart informing him his time was up, but Swaggart did not respond. On February 16, 1988, Gorman contacted James Hamil, one of the 13-man Executive Presbytery of the Assemblies of God. Hamill in turn called Raymond Carlson, the Assemblies Superintendent. He summoned Hamill and Gorman to fly to Springfield and arranged for an emergency meeting of the presbyters. Carlson was shown photos of several men coming in and going out of Room 7 at the Travel Inn Motel in New Orleans. This was done in order to establish the fact that the room was being used for prostitution. One of the men seen leaving Room 7 was Jimmy Swaggart. &lt;!-- [commented out &quot;he Gorman presented Swaggart with the photos in a blackmail attempt to force Swaggart to come clean, but Swaggart refused&quot; it is not a true statement] --&gt; The presbytery leadership of the Assemblies of God decided that Swaggart should be suspended from broadcasting his television program for three months.

According to the [[Associated Press]], Murphree, who claimed to have posed nude for Swaggart, failed a [[polygraph test]] administered by a [[New York City Police Department]] polygraph expert.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press. ''[[Ocala Star-Banner]]'', February 27, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; The test administrator concluded that Murphree had failed to tell the truth on all key questions concerning her statement. The test was administered after Murphree offered to sell the story to the ''[[National Enquirer]]'' for $100,000. Paul Levy, senior editor for the ''Enquirer'', stated that the polygraph examiner had concluded Murphree was not truthful on six key questions, including one in which she was reportedly asked if she had fabricated the story. Levy stated that the ''Enquirer'' decided not to print her story due to the test results, her drug use, and the fact that she had arrest warrants in three states. Murphree failed questions about whether she was paid or promised money to &quot;set up&quot; Swaggart, and whether she made up the story in order to make money from it.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Toronto Star]]'', February 27, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Both times she answered no; this was determined by the polygraph examiner to be a lie.

====Swaggart's confession and downfall====
[[File:Swaggart confession screenshot.png|thumb|right|Swaggart's confession]]
On February 21, 1988, without giving any details regarding his transgressions, Swaggart gave his now-infamous &quot;I Have Sinned&quot; speech as he tearfully spoke to his family, congregation, TV audience, and finally the Lord, saying, &quot;I have sinned against You, my Lord, and I would ask that Your Precious Blood would wash and cleanse every stain until it is in the seas of God's forgiveness, not to be remembered against me anymore.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanrhetoric.com/speeches/jswaggartapologysermon.html |title=Reverend Jimmy Swaggart: Apology Sermon |accessdate=January 25, 2007 |last=Swaggart |first=Jimmy |work=americanrhetoric.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; On a New Orleans morning news show four days later, Murphree stated that while Swaggart was a regular client, they had never engaged in sexual intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://everything2.com/title/Jimmy%2520Swaggart |title=Jimmy Swaggart on Everything2.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clip of Swaggart's confession was played repeatedly on news and tabloid television programs.

The [[Louisiana]] presbytery of the Assemblies of God initially suspended Jimmy Swaggart from the ministry for three months. The national presbytery of the Assemblies of God soon extended the suspension to their standard two-year suspension for sexual immorality. His return to the pulpit coincided with the end of a three-month suspension originally ordered by the Assemblies. Believing that Swaggart was not genuinely repentant in not submitting to their authority, the hierarchy of the Assemblies of God immediately defrocked him, removing his credentials and ministerial license. It was then that Swaggart decided he would be an independent, non-denominational Pentecostal minister and Family Worship Center would become non-denominational. Jimmy Swaggart Bible College (now World Evangelism Bible College) would lose many of its students by the end of May 1988.

===1991 scandal===
On October 11, 1991, Swaggart for a second time was found in the company of a prostitute, Rosemary Garcia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Swaggart Plans to Step Down | date=October 15, 1991 | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE5DA1E3BF936A25753C1A967958260 | work =The New York Times | accessdate =January 25, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; when he was pulled over by the [[California Highway Patrol]] in [[Indio, California]], for driving on the wrong side of the road. According to Garcia, Swaggart stopped to proposition her on the side of the road. When the patrolman asked Garcia why she was with Swaggart, she replied, &quot;He asked me for sex. I mean, that's why he stopped me. That's what I do. I'm a prostitute.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE5DA1E3BF936A25753C1A967958260 Swaggart Plans to Step Down] ''New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntskeptics.org/1991/1991november/november1991.htm |title=The Newsletter of The North Texas Skeptics |publisher=Ntskeptics.org |date= |accessdate=March 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This time, rather than confessing to his congregation, Swaggart told those at Family Worship Center that &quot;The Lord told me it's flat none of your business.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,974120,00.html American Notes Scandals]''Time''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/opinion/columnists/datelinedc/s_558619.html The arrogance of power] ''Pittsburgh Tribune-Review''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/21/newsid_2565000/2565197.stm |work=BBC News | title=1988: TV evangelist quits over sex scandal | date=February 21, 1988 | accessdate=May 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swaggart's son Donnie then announced to the stunned audience that his father would be temporarily stepping down as head of Jimmy Swaggart Ministries for &quot;a time of healing and counseling.&quot;

===Criticism of Christian rock and metal music===
Swaggart wrote a book criticizing the [[Christian rock]] and [[Christian metal|metal]] movements titled ''Religious Rock n' Roll&amp;nbsp;– A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing'' in 1987. The book criticized the scene for using heavy metal music to preach the gospel of Christianity, calling rock music the music of [[the devil]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rock_for_the_King_1&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | url = http://www.metalfortheking.kit.net/thocrm.htm | title = History of Christian Rock/Metal part 1 | work = Rock for the King | publisher = Ope Publishing | accessdate =December 19, 2007|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rock_for_the King_2&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | url = http://www.metalfortheking.kit.net/thocrm02.htm | title = History of Christian Rock/Metal part 2| work = Rock for the King | publisher = Ope Publishing | accessdate =December 19, 2007|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swaggart also criticized [[Larry Norman]] (the &quot;father of Christian rock&quot;), [[Petra (band)|Petra]], [[Mylon LeFevre]], [[Steve Taylor]] and other notable Christian rock and metal bands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guidetopetra.com/tributes.html?ID=67 |title=A Guide to Petra: Petra Retirement Tribute Page – post your thoughts on Petra's retirement announcement |publisher=Guidetopetra.com |date=September 7, 2007 |accessdate=March 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, Swaggart called rock music &quot;the new pornography.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mathieu Deflem |url=http://deflem.blogspot.com/1993/08/rap-rock-and-censorship-1993.html |title=Rap, Rock, and Censorship |date= |accessdate=September 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ministries==
Currently, Jimmy Swaggart Ministries mainly comprises Family Worship Center, ''The Jimmy Swaggart Telecast'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsm.org/explore.cfm/tvprogramming/cablesatellites |title=Jimmy Swaggart Ministries&amp;nbsp;— TV Programming |accessdate=January 28, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070123133753/http://www.jsm.org/explore.cfm/tvprogramming/cablesatellites &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = January 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; radio and television programs called ''A Study in the Word'', ''SonLife Radio Network'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsm.org/explore.cfm/sonliferadio/programminglog |title=Jimmy Swaggart Ministries&amp;nbsp;— SonLife Radio|accessdate=February 22, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070202204930/http://www.jsm.org/explore.cfm/sonliferadio/programminglog &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = February 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; a website, JSM.org; and a 24/7 cable and satellite television network, ''SonLife Broadcasting Network (SBN)''.

Swaggart's wife Frances hosts a television program, ''Frances and Friends,'' which is seen daily on SBN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.francesandfriends.com |title=Frances and Friends}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swaggart also hosts a daily Bible study program on SBN, ''The Message of the Cross''. His son Donnie preaches at Family Worship Center and also preaches in churches across America and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.donnieswaggart.com |title=Donnie Swaggart}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donnie's son Gabriel is the ministry's [[youth pastor]] who leads ''Crossfire,'' Family Worship Center's youth ministry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.crossfireyouthministry.org |title=CrossFire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music ministry===
Swaggart's first album, ''Some Golden Daybreak'', was recorded to give to people at his early revivals. Swaggart's wife then began encouraging him to contact radio stations. Disc jockey Chuck Cossin is credited with playing the first Jimmy Swaggart recording on WMUZ in Detroit.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

In 1974 Swaggart was voted Favorite Gospel Music Artist by readers of the magazine ''Singing News''.  In 1977 ''Record World'' magazine honored him as Male Vocalist of the Year. In that same year, Swaggart was a [[Dove Award]] finalist in three categories: Male Vocalist of the Year, TV Program of the Year, and Instrumentalist of the Year.  In 1978, Swaggart again became a [[Dove Award|Dove]] finalist as Instrumentalist of the Year.  In 1980, Swaggart became a Dove Award finalist in four categories:  Children's Album of the Year for ''Color Me a Story'', Instrumentalist of the Year, Year's best Traditional Album for ''Homeward Bound'', and Best Gospel Album of the Year for ''Worship''. The secular [[Grammy Awards]] nominated Swaggart's album ''Live from Nashville'' for Best Gospel Album in 1976. And again in 1980, Swaggart's album, ''Worship'', became a [[Grammy]] finalist.

===Radio ministry===
Swaggart originated SonLife Radio on the noncommercial [[FM band|FM]] band. Unlike his previous stations, SonLife was commercial-free and would not sell time to outside ministries and the preaching and teaching would all be produced &quot;in house&quot;. The music played was primarily [[Southern Gospel]]. SonLife Radio is heard in 22 states and streamed on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sonlifetv.com/sonlife-radio/station-list|title=SonLife station list}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television ministry===
In 1973, Swaggart wanted to create a television program which would include a fairly large music segment, a short sermon, and time for talking about current ministry projects. After two faltering attempts to tape the half-hour program in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]] and [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], Swaggart went to television producers in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] with his proposal. They accepted and within weeks the ''Jimmy Swaggart Telecast'' was being broadcast into television markets around the United States.

In 1981, Swaggart launched a daily television program titled ''A Study in the Word''.  Throughout the 1980s, the program was aired on over 160 channels throughout the U.S., Canada and abroad and is still seen today on over 78 stations in 104 countries.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} From the beginning, the primary cable channels the program was aired on were [[CBN Cable]] (now [[ABC Family]]), [[Trinity Broadcasting Network|TBN]], and the old [[PTL Satellite Network|PTL Network]] (now the [[Inspiration Network]]). Jimmy Swaggart Ministries now airs programming 24/7 over its own '''SonLife Broadcasting Network''' (SBN), on [[DirecTV]] channel 344, [[Dish Network]] channel 257, [[Glorystar]] channel 125, IPTV [[Sky Angel]] channel 125, and various cable TV providers and broadcast stations.

===World Evangelism Bible College===
In the fall of 1984, Swaggart opened Jimmy Swaggart Bible College (now World Evangelism Bible College, or WEBC). The college began as a means of preparing young men and women for Christian ministry, including education and communication degrees, and is still considered by Swaggart to be a vital extension of Jimmy Swaggart's World Wide Ministry. Many students dropped out prior to the fall semester after the scandal in 1988. Currently, WEBC offers three levels of degrees: (1) Intensive short term certificate programs, (2) Associate of Arts degree programs, and (3) a four year [[Bachelor's Degree]] program.

===Print===
Swaggart is the author of about 20 Christian books offered through his ministry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/author/list/268010.Jimmy_Swaggart |title=Books by Jimmy Swaggart (Author of The Expositor's Study Bible KJVersion/Concordance) |publisher=Goodreads.com |date= |accessdate=March 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the author of the &quot;Expositor's Study Bible,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Claire |first=Ellie |url=http://www.amazon.com/Expositors-Study-Bible-KJVersion-Concordance/dp/0976953005 |title=The Expositor's Study Bible KJVersion/Concordance (9780976953005): Jimmy Swaggart: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=March 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 13 Study Guides and 30 Commentaries on the Bible. The ministry also publishes a monthly magazine, '''The Evangelist'''.

==Family==
Swaggart is married to Frances ({{née}} Anderson) Swaggart and has one son, [[Donnie Swaggart]].  Donnie was named for Swaggart's brother, who died in infancy. He has three grandchildren: Jennifer, Gabriel, and Matthew Swaggart; and five great-grandchildren: Samantha, Abby, Ryder, Lola, and Harper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsm.org/jimmy_swaggart.html |title=Jimmy Swaggart Ministries&amp;nbsp;— About Jimmy Swaggart |work=jsm.org |accessdate=July 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
