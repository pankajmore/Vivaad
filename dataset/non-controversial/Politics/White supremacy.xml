'''White supremacy''' is the belief, and/or promotion of the belief, that [[white people]] are superior to people of other [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial backgrounds]]. The term is sometimes used specifically to describe a [[political ideology]] that advocates the [[Society|social]], [[Politics|political]], [[Historical revisionism|historical]] and/or [[Institutional racism|industrial]] dominance by whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Privilege Revealed: How Invisible Preference Undermines America |last=Wildman |first=Stephanie M. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1996 |publisher=NYU Press |location= |isbn=0-8147-9303-7 |page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;
White supremacy, as with racial [[supremacism]] in general, is rooted in [[ethnocentrism]] and a desire for [[hegemony]] and power,
&lt;ref&gt;Mistry, Reena (1999). ''[http://www.theory.org.uk/ctr-rol6.htm Can Gramsci's theory of hegemony help us to understand the representation of ethnic minorities in western television and cinema?]'' Institute of Communications Studies, Leeds University&lt;/ref&gt; and has frequently resulted in violence against non-whites{{citation}}. Different forms of white supremacy have different conceptions of who is considered white, and not all white supremacist organizations agree on who is their greatest enemy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Spaces of Hate: Geographies of Discrimination and Intolerance in the U.S.A. |last=Flint  |first=Colin |year=2004 |publisher=Routledge |location= |isbn=0-415-93586-5 |page=53 |quote=Although white racist activists must adopt a political identity of whiteness, the flimsy definition of whiteness in modern culture poses special challenges for them. In both mainstream and white supremacist discourse, to be white is to be distinct from those marked as nonwhite, yet the placement of the distinguishing line has varied significantly in different times and places. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

White supremacist groups can be found in some countries and regions with a significant white population including [[Europe]], [[North America]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Latin America]], and [[South Africa]]. The militant approach taken by white supremacist groups has caused them to be watched closely by law enforcement officials. Some have even been labelled as terrorists. Some European countries have laws forbidding [[hate speech]], as well as other laws that ban or restrict some white supremacist organizations.

==Systemic white supremacy==
White supremacy was dominant in the [[United States]] before the [[American Civil War]] and for decades after [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fredrickson | first = George | title = White Supremacy | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford Oxfordshire | year = 1981 | isbn = 0-19-503042-7 |page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; In large areas of the United States, this included the holding of non-whites (specifically [[African American]]s) in [[slavery in the United States|chattel slavery]]. The outbreak of the Civil War saw the desire to uphold white supremacy cited as a cause for state secession&lt;ref&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/csa_texsec.asp A Declaration of the Causes which Impel the State of Texas to Secede from the Federal Union]: &quot;We hold as undeniable truths that the governments of the various States, and of the confederacy itself, were established exclusively by the white race, for themselves and their posterity; that the African race had no agency in their establishment; that they were rightfully held and regarded as an inferior and dependent race, and in that condition only could their existence in this country be rendered beneficial or tolerable. That in this free government all white men are and of right ought to be entitled to equal civil and political rights; that the servitude of the African race, as existing in these States, is mutually beneficial to both bond and free, and is abundantly authorized and justified by the experience of mankind, and the revealed will of the Almighty Creator, as recognized by all Christian nations; while the destruction of the existing relations between the two races, as advocated by our sectional enemies, would bring inevitable calamities upon both and desolation upon the fifteen slave-holding states.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and the formation of the [[Confederate States of America]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?documentprint=76 The &quot;Cornerstone Speech&quot;, Alexander H. Stephens (Vice President of the Confederate States), March 21, 1861, Savannah, Georgia]: &quot;Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite idea; its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery--subordination to the superior race--is his natural and normal condition.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In some parts of the United States, many people who were considered non-white were [[Disfranchisement|disenfranchised]], barred from government office, and prevented from holding most government jobs well into the second half of the 20th century. Many [[U.S. state]]s banned [[interracial marriage]] through [[anti-miscegenation laws]] until 1967, when these laws were declared unconstitutional. White leaders often viewed [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] as obstacles to economic and political progress, rather than as [[settler]]s in their own right.

White supremacy was also dominant in [[South Africa under apartheid]] and in parts of [[Europe]] at various time periods. Governments of many European-settled countries bordering the [[Pacific Ocean]] limited immigration and naturalization from the Asian Pacific countries, usually on a cultural basis. [[South Africa]] maintained its white supremacist apartheid system until the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = abolitioin of the White Australia Policy |url = http://www.immi.gov.au/media/fact-sheets/08abolition.htm | publisher = Australian Government | date= November 2010 | access date October 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.britannica.com.ezproxy.csu.edu.au/EBchecked/topic/555568/South-Africa/259494/The-apartheid-years | title = Encyclopaedia Britannia, South Africa the Apartheid Years | publisher = Encyclopaedia Britannia | accessdate = October 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic use of the term==
The term ''white supremacy'' is used in academic studies of racial power to denote a system of [[structural racism]] which privileges white people over others, regardless of the presence or absence of racial hatred. Legal scholar Frances Lee Ansley explains this definition as follows:
:By &quot;white supremacy&quot; I do not mean to allude only to the self-conscious racism of white supremacist hate groups. I refer instead to a political, economic and cultural system in which whites overwhelmingly control power and material resources, conscious and unconscious ideas of white superiority and entitlement are widespread, and relations of white dominance and non-white subordination are daily reenacted across a broad array of institutions and social settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ansley|first=Francis Lee|title=Stirring the Ashes: Race, Class and the Future of Civil Rights Scholarship|journal=Cornell Law Review|year=1989|volume=74|pages=993ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Temple University Press | isbn = 978-1-56639-532-8 | editors = Richard Delgado and Jean Stefancic (eds.) | last = Ansley | first = Francis Lee | title = Critical white studies: Looking behind the mirror | chapter = White supremacy (and what we should do about it) | date = 1997-06-29 | page = 592 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This and similar definitions are adopted or proposed by Charles Mills,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pages = 35–48 | last = Mills | first = C.W. | title = White supremacy as sociopolitical system: A philosophical perspective | journal = White out: The continuing significance of racism | year = 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[bell hooks]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Pluto Press | isbn = 978-0-7453-1663-5 | last = Hooks | first = Bell | title = Feminist theory: From margin to center | date = 200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; David Gillborn,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1177/1468796806068323 | issn = 1468-7968, 1741-2706 | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 318–340 | last = Gillborn | first = David | title = Rethinking White Supremacy Who Counts in ‘WhiteWorld’ | journal = Ethnicities | accessdate = 2012-03-14 | date = 2006-09-01 | url = http://etn.sagepub.com/content/6/3/318 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Neely Fuller Jr.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = SAGE | asin = B0007BLCWC | last = Fuller | first = Neely | title = The united-independent compensatory code/system/concept: A textbook/workbook for thought, speech, and/or action, for victims of racism (white supremacy) | year = 1984 | page = 334 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[anti-racist education|anti-racist educators]], such as Betita Martinez and the Challenging White Supremacy workshop, also use the term in this way. The term expresses historic continuities between a pre-[[Civil Rights movement|Civil Rights]] era of open white supremacism and the current racial power structure of the United States. It also expresses the visceral impact of structural racism through &quot;provocative and brutal&quot; language that characterizes racism as &quot;nefarious, global, systemic, and constant.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis US | isbn = 978-0-415-98980-0 | editors = Jeanette Davidson and George Yancy (eds.) | last = Davidson | first = Tim | title = Critical perspectives on Bell Hooks | chapter = bell hooks, white supremacy, and the academy | date = 2009-02-23 | page = 68 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Academic users of this term sometimes prefer it to ''racism'' because it allows for a disconnection between racist feelings and white racial advantage or [[white privilege|privilege]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Why is it so difficult for many white folks to understand that racism is oppressive not because white folks have prejudicial feelings about blacks (they could have such feelings and leave us alone) but because it is a system that promotes domination and subjugation?&quot; {{Cite book | publisher = Turnaround Publisher Services Limited | isbn = 978-1-873262-02-3 | last = hooks | first = bell | title = Black Looks: Race and Representation | date = 2009-02-04 | page = 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grillo and Wildman cite hooks to argue for the term racism/white supremacy: &quot;hooks writes that liberal whites do not see themselves as prejudiced or interested in domination through coercion, and do not acknowledge the ways they the ways they contribute to and benefit from the system of white privilege.&quot; &quot; {{Cite book | publisher = Temple University Press | isbn = 978-1-56639-532-8 | editors = Richard Delgado and Jean Stefancic (eds.) | last = Grillo | first = Trina | coauthors = Stephanie M. Wildman | title = Critical white studies: Looking behind the mirror | chapter = The implications of making comparisons between racism and sexism (or other isms) | date = 1997-06-29 | page =  620 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideologies and movements==
Supporters of [[Nordic theory|Nordicism]] and [[Germanism]] consider [[Nordic race|Nordic]] people ([[Scandinavia]]ns, [[Germans]], [[English people|English]], [[Scots]], [[Irish]], [[Balts]] and [[Dutch people|Dutch]]) to be superior, shunning those of Southern and Eastern Europe (who may have darker features and different cultures), including mostly [[Jews]], [[Slavic peoples]], [[Romani people|Gypsies]], [[Spanish people|Spanish]], [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], [[Italian people|Italians]],  [[white Latin American]]s, [[Lusophone]], [[White Africans of European ancestry|white Africans]], along with anyone whose ethnic heritage is not Germanic or Nordic. By the early-19th century white supremacy was attached to emerging theories of racial hierarchy. The German philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] attributed civilisational primacy to the White race:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The highest civilization and culture, apart from the ancient Hindus and Egyptians, are found exclusively among the white races; and even with many dark peoples, the ruling caste or race is fairer in colour than the rest and has, therefore, evidently immigrated, for example, the Brahmans, the Incas, and the rulers of the South Sea Islands. All this is due to the fact that necessity is the mother of invention because those tribes that emigrated early to the north, and there gradually became white, had to develop all their intellectual powers and invent and perfect all the arts in their struggle with need, want and misery, which in their many forms were brought about by the climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Image:Klan-in-gainesville.jpg|thumb|left|Members of the second [[Ku Klux Klan]] at a rally in 1923.]]
The [[eugenics|eugenicist]] [[Madison Grant]] argued that the Nordic race had been responsible for most of humanity's great achievements, and that admixture was &quot;race suicide&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

''The Passing of the Great Race''. Charles Scribner's Sons, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK) is the group most associated with the white supremacist movement. Many white supremacist groups are based on the concept of preserving genetic purity, and do not focus solely on [[discrimination]] by skin color.&lt;ref name=&quot;law.jrank.org&quot;&gt;http://law.jrank.org/pages/11302/White-Supremacy-Groups.html White Supremacy Groups&lt;/ref&gt; The KKK's reasons for supporting [[racial segregation]] are not primarily based on religious ideals, but some Klan groups are openly [[Protestantism|Protestant]]. The KKK and other white supremacist groups like [[Aryan Nations]], [[The Order (group)|The Order]] and the [[White Patriot Party]] are considered [[Anti-Semitism|Anti-Semitic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;law.jrank.org&quot;/&gt;

[[Christian Identity]] is another movement closely tied to white supremacy. Some white supremacists identify themselves as [[Ásatrú|Odinists]], although many Odinists reject white supremacy. Some white supremacist groups, such as the [[South Africa]]n [[Boeremag]], conflate elements of Christianity and Odinism. The World Church of the Creator (now called the [[Creativity Movement]]) is [[atheistic]] and denounces the Christian religion and other deistic religions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atheistic&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=HB1wyFPRGm4C&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=atheism+white+supremacy#v=onepage&amp;q=atheistic&amp;f=false|title =The new white nationalism in America: its challenge to integration|publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]|quote=For instance, Ben Klassen, founder of the atheistic World Church of the Creator and the author of ''The White Man's Bible'', discusses Christianity extensively in his writings and denounces religion that has brought untold horror into the world and divided the white race.|accessdate = 2011–03–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Atheism&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=rBgn3xB75ZcC&amp;pg=PA493&amp;dq=competing+atheistic+white+racist+movement#v=onepage&amp;q=competing%20atheistic%20white%20racist%20movement&amp;f=false|title =The World's Religions: Continuities and Transformations|publisher = [[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|quote=A competing atheistic or panthestic white racist movement also appeared, which included the Church of the Creator/ Creativity (Gardell 2003: 129–134).|accessdate = 2011–03–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from this, its ideology is similar to many Christian Identity groups, in their belief that there is a [[Jewish conspiracy]] in control of   governments, the banking industry and the media. [[Matthew F. Hale]], founder of the World Church of the Creator has published articles stating that all races other than white are &quot;mud races,&quot; which the religion teaches.&lt;ref name=&quot;law.jrank.org&quot;/&gt; 

The white supremacist ideology has become associated with a [[Racism|racist]] faction of the [[skinhead]] [[subculture]], despite the fact that when the skinhead culture first developed in the [[United Kingdom]] in the late 1960s, it was heavily influenced by [[black]] fashions and music, especially [[Jamaica]]n [[reggae]] and [[ska]], and [[African American]] [[soul music]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20010219175613/ska.about.com/musicperform/ska/library/1999/aa081699a.htm Smiling Smash: An Interview with Cathal Smyth, a.k.a.

White supremacist recruitment tactics are primarily on a [[grassroots]] level and on the Internet. Widespread access to the Internet has led to a dramatic increase in white supremacist websites.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adversity&quot;&gt;Adams, Josh, and Vincent J. Roscigno &quot;White Supremacists, Oppositional Culture and the World Wide Web.&quot; University on North Carolina Press 84 (2005): 759-788. JSTOR. Web. 20 Nov. 2009. &lt;http://www.jstor.org/stable/3598477&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet provides a venue to openly express white supremacist ideas at little [[social cost]], because people who post the information are able to remain anonymous.

==Alliances with black supremacist groups==

Due to some commonly held separatist ideologies, some white supremacist organizations have found limited common cause with [[black supremacy|black supremacist]] or extremist organizations.

In 1961 and 1962 [[George Lincoln Rockwell]], the leader of the [[American Nazi Party]], was invited to speak by [[Elijah Muhammad]] at a [[Nation of Islam]] rally. In 1965, after breaking with the Nation of Islam and denouncing its separatist doctrine, [[Malcolm X]] told his followers that the Nation of Islam under Elijah Muhammad had made agreements with the American Nazi Party and the Ku Klux Klan that &quot;were not in the interests of Negros.&quot; In 1985 [[Louis Farrakhan]] invited white supremacist [[Tom Metzger (white supremacist)|Tom Metzger]], leader of the [[White Aryan Resistance]] (a neo-Nazi white power group), to attend a NOI gathering. ''[[The Washington Times]]'' reports Metzger's words of praise: &quot;They speak out against the Jews and the oppressors in Washington.... They are the black counterpart to us.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}
