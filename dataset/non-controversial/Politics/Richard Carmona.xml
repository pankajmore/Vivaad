'''Richard Henry Carmona''' (born November 22, 1949)&lt;ref name=biography&gt;{{cite news|title=Phoenix Arizona Election Questionnaire for Congress, Richard Carmona|url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/politics/2012questionnaires/results.php?id=carmonar|accessdate=24 October 2012|newspaper=AZ Central}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is an American [[physician]], police officer, public health administrator, and politician. He was a [[Vice admiral (United States)|vice admiral]] in the [[United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps|Public Health Service Commissioned Corps]] and served as the seventeenth [[Surgeon General of the United States]]. Appointed by [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] in 2002, Carmona left office at the end of July 2006 upon the expiration of his term. After leaving office, Carmona was highly critical of the [[George W. Bush Administration|Bush administration]] for suppressing scientific findings which conflicted with the Administration's ideological agenda.

In August 2006, Carmona returned home to [[Tucson, Arizona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Paul L. |last=Allen |title=Chicago proud one of its own |url=http://www.tucsoncitizen.com/daily/local/21262.php |publisher=Tucson Citizen |date=2006-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2011, he announced he would seek the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]]'s nomination for [[United States Senate]] in the hopes of succeeding outgoing [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] Senator [[Jon Kyl]], despite being registered as a political [[independent (politician)|Independent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/federal-government/former-surgeon-general-in-bush-administration-will-run-as-a-democratic-in-senate-race/2011/11/10/gIQApqz38M_story.html|agency=The Washington Post|date=10 November 2011|accessdate=13 November 2011|title=Former surgeon general in Bush administration will run as a Democratic in Senate race|deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=December 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life, education, and early career==
Carmona was born in [[New York City]], of [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] descent, and raised in [[Harlem]]. After dropping out of [[DeWitt Clinton High School]] at age 16, he enlisted in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Burger, Timothy J. [http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2002/03/27/2002-03-27_prez_taps_maverick_for_surge.html &quot;PREZ TAPS MAVERICK FOR SURGEON GENERAL&quot;], ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'', March 27, 2002. Accessed September 14, 2009. &quot;Carmona, 52, who dropped out of Dewitt Clinton High School in Harlem at 16 and later joined the Army, got a GED and was a Green Beret in Vietnam, where he was wounded twice.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; While enlisted, he received his [[GED|General Educational Development (GED)]], joined the [[United States Army Special Forces]], became a combat-decorated [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] [[veteran]], and began his career in [[medicine]] as a Special Forces medic.

After leaving active duty, Carmona attended the [[Bronx Community College]] of the [[City University of New York]], where he earned his associate of arts degree in nursing. In 1977, he graduated from the [[University of California, San Francisco]] (UCSF), with a bachelor of science degree in biology and chemistry; in 1979, he received his medical degree from UCSF, where he was awarded the prestigious gold headed cane as the top graduate. In 1998, he earned a [[Master of Public Health|Master's degree in Public Health]] (M.P.H.) from the [[University of Arizona]].&lt;ref name=biography/&gt;

==Medical career==
Carmona worked in various positions in the medical field including [[paramedic]], [[registered nurse]], and [[physician]]. He completed a surgical residency at UCSF and a [[National Institutes of Health]]-sponsored fellowship in trauma, burns, and critical care. Carmona is a [[Fellow of the American College of Surgeons]] and certified in correctional health care and in quality assurance. Carmona has been Chairman of the [[Arizona]] Southern Regional Emergency Medical System, Chief Medical Officer, hospital CEO, public health officer, and chief executive officer of the Pima County health care system. In 1997, the Pima County system, which was in financial trouble before he was appointed, continued to lose millions of dollars and he resigned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,221152,00.html#ixzz1a95hdUsl | work=Time | first=Mitch | last=Frank | title=The Doctor Is Armed | date=March 31, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carmona was not in control of the assets of the system but was held responsible for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.cnn.com/2002-07-17/health/carmona.profile_1_richard-carmona-surgeon-general-nominee-pima-county-sheriff-s-department?_s=PM:HEALTH | work=Time | title=Who is Dr. Richard Carmona? | date=17 July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carmona was also a professor of medicine at the [[University of Arizona]].

==Law enforcement career==
He worked for the [[Pima County, Arizona|Pima County]] [[Sheriff's department|Sheriff's Department]] since 1986. He eventually worked his way up to [[deputy sheriff]]. He served as medical director of the county's police and fire departments. He was a peace officer leader of the [[SWAT]] division, with expertise in special operations and emergency preparedness, including [[weapons of mass destruction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/27/us/man-in-the-news-a-man-of-many-professions-richard-henry-carmona.html | work=The New York Times | first=Robert | last=Pear | title=Man in the News; A Man of Many Professions -- Richard Henry Carmona | date=March 27, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1999, he confronted a mentally-ill person who was assaulting someone else at a car accident. After the person would not step out of his car, he shot at Carmona, grazing his head, and the Deputy Sheriff shot back seven times, killing him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nominee for surgeon general criticized|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SuBIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=X4IMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1117,3836840&amp;dq=richard+carmona&amp;hl=en|newspaper=The Vindicator|date=July 9, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deceased was an ex-convict who had shot and killed his own father that day. In 2000, Carmona was honored at the [[National Association of Police Organizations]] TOP COPS award ceremony.

===Nomination===
President Bush nominated Carmona to become the 17th Surgeon General of the United States in March 2002. During the nomination process, Carmona was questioned about his management style and the amount of time it took him to become board-certified in his field. Carmona described himself as an &quot;agent of change&quot; willing to question the status quo, but that he always treated &quot;patients, staff, and co-workers with respect.&quot;  Senators on both sides of the aisle praised Carmona's qualifications and supported his nomination; he was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on July 23, 2002 by a vote of 98-0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/134379051.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jul+10%2C+2002&amp;author=Michael+Kranish%2C+Globe+Staff&amp;pub=Boston+Globe&amp;desc=BUSH+NOMINEE+DEFENDS+PAST+CARMONA+EXPECTED+TO+GET+HEALTH+POST&amp;pqatl=google | work=Boston Globe | first=Michael | last=Kranish | title=Bush Nominee Defends Past Carmona Expected To Get Health Post | date=July 10, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Meckler|first=Laura|title=Surgeon general nominee defends record|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=J7UaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mT8EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4192,6622157&amp;dq=richard+carmona&amp;hl=en|newspaper=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=July 9, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=107&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00185 |title=Motion to Invoke Cloture on the Nomination of Richard H. Carmona, to be Surgeon General |publisher=U.S. Senate: Legislation &amp; Records |date=July 23, 2002 |accessdate=March 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secondhand smoke===
{{See|Passive smoking}}

In 2006, Carmona released a landmark Surgeon General's report on the health effects of [[passive smoking|secondhand smoke]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/secondhandsmoke/ The Health Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke: A Report of the Surgeon General]. Issued June 27, 2006; accessed March 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Carmona's report underlined the risks of secondhand smoke exposure, stating: &quot;The debate is over. The science is clear: Secondhand smoke is not a mere annoyance, but a serious health hazard.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2006/06/28/secondhandsmoke_hea.html?category=health |title=Surgeon General: Beware Secondhand Smoke |last=Neergaard |first=Lauran |date=2006-06-28 |agency=Associated Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report encouraged the adoption of indoor [[smoking ban]]s and noted that such bans did not appear to have a harmful economic effect on bars and restaurants. After leaving office, Carmona testified before Congress that the [[George W. Bush Administration|Bush Administration]] had tried for years to &quot;water down&quot; his findings on the dangers of secondhand smoke, and had pressured him not to testify in the tobacco industry's [[racketeering]] trial.&lt;ref name=&quot;nzherald&quot;/&gt;

In earlier testimony before the [[U.S. Congress]], Carmona stated that he would not object to a ban on all tobacco products &quot;if Congress chose to go that way.&quot; The Bush Administration distanced itself from this statement.&lt;ref name=smokingprohib&gt;{{cite news |first=Marc |last=Kaufman |title=Surgeon General Favors Tobacco Ban |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;contentId=A10014-2003Jun3 |work=Nation |publisher=Washington Post |date=2003-06-04 |quote=Surgeon General Richard Carmona said yesterday that he supports the banning of tobacco products -- the first time that the government's top doctor and public health advocate has made such a strong statement about the historically contentious subject.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-Surgeon General career==
Carmona is currently vice chairman of the Canyon Ranch resort and spa company, president of the non-profit Canyon Ranch Institute, and a professor at the Mel and Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health at the [[University of Arizona]]. On June 16, 2010, [[Ross University|Ross University School of Medicine]] named Carmona to its Board of Trustees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rossu.edu/news/Ross-University-Names-17th-Surgeon-General-to-its-Board-of-Trustees.cfm |title=Ross University Names 17th Surgeon General to its Board of Trustees |publisher=Ross University |date=June 16, 2010 |accessdate=March 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Republicans attempted to recruit Carmona to run for Congress in [[Arizona's 8th congressional district]], but he declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Nathan L. |last=Gonzales |url=http://rothenbergpoliticalreport.com/news/article/candidates-battle-for-cash-in-house-open-seats |title=Candidates Battle for Cash in House Open Seats |publisher=The Rothenberg Political Report |date=February 7, 2006 |accessdate=2012-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of Bush administration===
On July 10, 2007, Carmona, along with former Surgeons General [[C. Everett Koop]] and [[David Satcher]], testified before the [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform]] about political and ideological interference with the Surgeon General's mission. Carmona accused the [[George W. Bush Administration|Bush Administration]] of preventing him from speaking out on certain public health issues such as [[embryonic stem cell research]], [[global climate change]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Julie |last=Rovner |title=Ex-Surgeon General Says Administration Interfered |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=11854247 |work=Politics |publisher=NPR |date=2007-07-10 |accessdate=2007-07-12  |quote=He recalled a meeting where senior White House officials talked about global warming as a liberal cause with no merit.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[emergency contraception]], and  [[abstinence-only sex education]], where the Administration's political stance conflicted with scientific and medical opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Harris |first=Gardiner |title=White House Is Accused of Putting Politics Over Science |newspaper=New York Times |date=July 10, 2007 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/10/washington/11cnd-surgeon.html?_r=1&amp;hp=&amp;oref=slogin&amp;pagewanted=print |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carmona also testified that the Bush Administration had attempted for years to &quot;water down&quot; his report on the dangers of [[passive smoking|secondhand smoke]] and pressured him not to testify in the tobacco industry's racketeering trial: &quot;Anything that doesn't fit into the political appointees' ideological, theological or political agenda is ignored, marginalized or simply buried.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Will |last=Dunham |title=Former Bush surgeon general says he was muzzled |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/politicsNews/idUSN1034212120070710 |publisher=Reuters |date=2007-07-10 |quote=‘Anything that doesn't fit into the political appointees' ideological, theological or political agenda is ignored, marginalized or simply buried’}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cjr&gt;{{cite news |first=Gal |last=Beckerman |title=Surgeon General's Warning: Politics always trumps science in the Bush White House|url=http://www.cjr.org/the_kicker/surgeon_generals_warning.php |work=The Kicker |publisher=Columbia Journalism Review |date=2007-07-11 |accessdate=2007-07-11 |quote=‘The problem with this approach is that in public health, as in a democracy, there is nothing worse than ignoring science or marginalizing the voice of science for reasons driven by changing political winds.’}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Carmona, he was even ordered not to attend the [[Special Olympics]] because the event was sponsored by the [[Kennedy family]], and was told to mention President Bush three times on every page of his speeches.&lt;ref name=&quot;nzherald&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Leonard |last=Doyle |title=White House 'gagged' Surgeon General |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/2/story.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=10451275 |work=Politics |publisher=New Zealand Herald |date=2007-07-13 |accessdate=2007-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[Washington Post]]'' subsequently identified [[William R. Steiger]] as the Bush Administration official who had blocked release of Carmona's report on global health because it conflicted with the Administration's political priorities.&lt;ref name=Post29&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/28/AR2007072801420.html?nav=hcmodule Bush Aide Blocked Report], Christopher Lee and Marc Kaufman, The Washington Post, July 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reuters reported that Carmona's predecessors as Surgeon General had acknowledged the high level of political interference he experienced, saying: &quot;We have never seen it as partisan, as malicious, as vindictive, as mean-spirited as it is today, and you clearly have worse than anyone's had.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters1&quot;/&gt;

==2012 U.S. Senate election==
{{Main|United States Senate election in Arizona, 2012}}
Carmona was the Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate in Arizona in the race to replace retiring Republican Senator [[Jon Kyl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hotlineoncall.nationaljournal.com/archives/2011/11/carmona-will-ru.php|title=Carmona Will Run in Arizona|date=November 10, 2011|accessdate=November 10, 2011|work=[[National Journal]]|first=Sean|last=Sullivan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nowicki|first=Dan|title=Rival out, path clear for Carmona in Democrat race|url=http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/news/articles/2012/03/28/20120328arizona-democrat-drops-out-senate-race.html|newspaper=The Arizona Republic|date=March 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lost to  Republican nominee [[Jeff Flake]] in the general election on November 6, 2012. Carmona said that he would bring his experience in science and medicine to the Senate, which will inform his analytical approach to the issues. He has been harshly critical of politicians whose ideology outweighs scientific evidence, such as [[Todd Akin]], and said that health issues must not be politicized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.advocatesaz.org/2012/10/04/meet-our-candidates-dr-richard-carmona-for-u-s-senator/|title=Meet Our Candidates: Dr. Richard Carmona for U.S. Senator|date=October 4, 2012|accessdate=October 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
