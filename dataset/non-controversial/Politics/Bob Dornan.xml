'''Robert Kenneth &quot;Bob&quot; Dornan''' (born April 3, 1933) is a [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] and former member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] from [[California]] and a vocal advocate of [[pro-life]] and [[social conservative]] causes.

A boisterous former actor and television talk show host, Dornan had a flair for the dramatic that drew him supporters and detractors well beyond his congressional districts. Though never a major power in Washington, he became one of the most well-known members of the House of Representatives and has been described as &quot;one of the leading firebrands among American politicians.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AAP96&quot;&gt;[[Michael Barone (pundit)|Michael Barone]] and Grant Ujifusa, ''[[The Almanac of American Politics]]'' 1996, [[National Journal]] Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Dornan attended Loyola University of Los Angeles (later renamed [[Loyola Marymount University]]) until 1953. At age 19, Dornan volunteered to join the [[United States Air Force]]. During his time in the USAF, he survived two emergency [[parachute]] ejections and two [[Deadstick landing|&quot;dead stick&quot; forced landings]] (including one of an [[F-100 Super Sabre|F-100]]). Dornan also served as a photographer during the [[Vietnam War]] and flew relief flights into [[Biafra]]. He was an active duty serviceman in [[USAF]] until 1958, reaching the rank of Captain.&lt;ref name=CongressBio&gt;[http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=D000435 Biographical Directory of the United States Congress]&lt;/ref&gt; He then served in the [[Air Force Reserve]] until 1975.&lt;ref name=CongressBio/&gt;

Dornan was also involved in entertainment. He starred in the movie ''[[The Starfighters]]'' (playing an Air Force pilot whose father is a U.S. congressman), which was featured on ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''. He acted in television series, including a frequent role as Captain Fowler on ''[[Twelve O'Clock High (TV series)|Twelve O'Clock High]]'' and smaller roles on ''[[Bewitched]]'' and ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]].'' Dornan was also an [[Emmy]]-award winning television talk show host on ''Tempo'' and ''The Robert K. Dornan Show'' broadcast from [[Los Angeles]] from 1967 to 1973.

==Politics==
[[File:DornanF161988.JPEG|thumb|right|Dornan stands on the ladder of an F-16 Fighting Falcon aircraft during his visit to [[Torrejon Air Base]], 20 September 1988]]
Dornan moved into politics in 1973 as national spokesman for the Citizens for Decency Through Law advocacy group. He made an unsuccessful run for [[mayor of Los Angeles, California|mayor of Los Angeles]] the same year. In 1976, Dornan was elected to the House of Representatives, representing the 27th Congressional District in western [[Los Angeles County]]. He was re-elected twice. He was such an unswerving advocate for the development of the [[B-1 bomber]], that he was soon nicknamed &quot;B-1 Bob.&quot; 

After the 1980 census, California's congressional map was redrawn. Dornan's district, previously a Republican-leaning swing district, was made significantly more Democratic. Believing he had no chance of winning this new district, he opted to run for the [[United States Senate]] in 1982. He finished fourth in the Republican primary behind [[List of mayors of San Diego|San Diego mayor]] and future [[list of Governors of California|Governor]] [[Pete Wilson]], who won in November.

Dornan moved to [[Garden Grove, California|Garden Grove]], in the more Republican [[Orange County, California|Orange County]]. In 1984, he was elected to Congress from the 38th District in central Orange County, defeating 10-year Democratic incumbent [[Jerry M. Patterson]] by a 53% to 45% margin amid [[Ronald Reagan]]'s massive landslide that year. In 1986, he won a tough race against Democratic state Assemblyman Richard Robinson, winning by a 55% to 43% margin. He was re-elected four more times and served on the [[U.S. House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|Intelligence Committee]].  His district was renumbered as the 46th District after the 1990 Census.

Dornan made headlines in March 1985 for a confrontation with Representative [[Thomas Joseph Downey|Thomas Downey]] ([[US Democratic Party|D]]-[[New York|NY]]) on the House floor. Downey asked Dornan about comments he had made calling Downey &quot;a draft-dodging wimp.&quot; According to Downey, Dornan, grabbing him by collar and tie, said, &quot;It's good you're being protected by the [[United States House of Representatives Sergeant at Arms|sergeant-at-arms]]. If I saw you outside, it would be a different story&quot; and threatened him &quot;with some form of bodily harm.&quot; Dornan claimed he was merely straightening Downey's tie and refused to apologize for the incident or the derogatory comment. A Dornan aide said, &quot;It will be a cold day in hell before he gets an apology from Bob Dornan.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Dornan Won't Apologize for Wimp Remark&quot;, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Mar 5, 1985. pg. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dornan was staunchly conservative. However, he held some positions that some might call liberal, including sponsoring animal protection acts, earning recognition by [[PETA]].

In 1995, he received a minor reprimand from the House for stating in a floor speech that President [[Bill Clinton]] had &quot;given aid and comfort to the enemy&quot; during the Vietnam War. In 1996, Dornan ran for [[President of the United States]], using his campaign primarily as a vehicle to continue to criticize Clinton. In a GOP debate in Iowa on January 13, Dornan called Clinton a &quot;criminal&quot; and a &quot;pathological liar.&quot; When asked why voters should choose Dornan over his Republican rivals to challenge Clinton in the general election, he argued that he had more children and grandchildren than the others, with only [[Richard Lugar]] coming anywhere near him on that score. {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

In 1997, Dornan sought and received information concerning reports that [[Israel]] had purportedly received from former military men who had emigrated from the [[Soviet Union]], concerning an alleged successful water landing of the [[KAL 007]] airliner, shot down by the Soviet Union in 1983. These included what Dornan termed &quot;credible reports&quot; of the supposed survival of Congressman [[Larry McDonald]] of Georgia, who had been a passenger on KAL 007, and Dornan featured this on his radio program.

For his final successful run for Congress, Dornan had signs posted at polling places that warned voters in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] that they should be prepared to prove their citizenship in order to vote, suggesting that immigration officials would be present. The success of this action was believed to have kept enough Latino voters away from the polls to eke out a final victory for Dornan against Mike Farber in an election that featured allegations of domestic violence by Dornan.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Dornan Challenges Foe's Claims of Spousal Abuse&quot;, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', October 26, 1994. http://articles.latimes.com/1994-10-26/local/me-54824_1_spousal-abuse-charges&lt;/ref&gt;  A long court battle deemed these signs illegal and inappropriate, and he was not able to post them again at the next election, which he then lost to [[Loretta Sanchez]]. &lt;!-- Does someone have more specifics on the signs and the court ruling? --&gt;

==Controversial statements==
[[File:Shutupfag.gif|thumb|right|''Shut Up Fag!'']]
During his political career, Dornan became known for his colorful, controversial, or offensive statements.  Among his remarks:

*During a House debate in 1994, Dornan [[outing|outed]] fellow Republican representative [[Steve Gunderson]], accusing him of having a &quot;revolving door on his [[the closet|closet]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dina ElBoghdady, &quot;Dornan Accuses Fellow Republican of Being Gay&quot;, [[States News Service]], March 24, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;
*In a 1986 U.S. House speech, he called Soviet journalist [[Vladimir Posner]] a &quot;disloyal, betraying little [[Jew]] who sits there on television claiming that he is somehow or other a newsman.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[United Press International]], &quot;Lawmaker Apologizes for 'Inelegant' Words&quot;, ''[[New York Times]]'', Mar 1, 1986, pg. 1.11.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the only statement Dornan apologized for, saying, &quot;That's the only thing in my life I ever lost sleep over&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTJune95&quot;&gt;Francis X. Clines, [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE7DB163DF934A15755C0A963958260 &quot; Appearing Nightly: Robert Dornan, Master of the Put-Down&quot;], ''[[New York Times]]'', June 27, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Dornan also said that he intended &quot;to say '[[Judas Iscariot|Judas]],' not 'Jew,'&quot; as a rebuttal to Posner's insistence that the [[Soviet Union]] was free of [[anti-Semitism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTJune95&quot;/&gt;
*&quot;Every [[lesbian]] spear chucker in this country is hoping I get defeated.&quot; — to a [[Los Angeles]] television reporter in 1992 regarding a female challenger in the primary election.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTJune95&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Romano, Lois &quot;The Reliable Source&quot;, ''[[Washington Post]]'', June 4, 1992, pg. c.03.&lt;/ref&gt;
*On a January 28, 1994 appearance on ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'', Dornan declared it was &quot;The Year of the Penis&quot; due to recent events in the news. This was a joke in regard to the 1992 media and political reference as that election being referred to as &quot;[[The Year of the Woman]]&quot;, when 4 women won election to the United States Senate. In relation to this comment by Dornan, Representative [[Barney Frank]] noted &quot;Bob Dornan isn't even rational on the House floor. You can't expect him to be rational on ''Politically Incorrect''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Senior, &quot;When Politicians Get Silly&quot;, ''[[New York Times]]'', Mar 6, 1994. pg. A.1.&lt;/ref&gt;
*&quot;You are a slimy coward. Go register in another party.&quot; — to Orange County (CA) Republican Central Committee member William Dougherty after he supported Dornan's opponent in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Time Magazine]]'', December 2, 1996 v148 n25 p28(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, a 120-page book of quotations of Dornan was compiled by Nathan Callahan and William Payton and published as ''Shut Up, Fag!'' The quotation that gives the book the title was actually shouted by Dornan's wife, Sallie, at an [[AIDS]] activist during an Orange County town forum. Dornan claimed the book was backed by director [[Oliver Stone]], whom Dornan labeled &quot;a [[Bolshevik]] enemy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Faye Fiore, &quot;'Shut Up' Is Not in Dornan's Vocabulary,&quot; ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Jul 15, 1994, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dornan's comments and behavior have led his political opponents to question his [[mental health]]. Mike Kaspar of the Orange County Democratic Party said, &quot;The primary issue is Bob Dornan, himself. I think his character and his own [[sanity]] are an issue here.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Dana Parsons]], &quot;Democrats Unveil Weapon Against Dornan — Dornan,&quot; ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', May 4, 1994, pg. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; At a [[White House Correspondents Dinner]], [[Al Franken]] (who is actually a friend of Dornan) joked &quot;having [[Al D'Amato]] leading an [[ethics investigation]] is like getting Bob Dornan to head up a mental health task force.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Schapiro, [http://www.salon.com/07/features/franken2.html &quot;The Salon Interview: Al Franken&quot;], [[Salon.com]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Moore]] devoted an entire chapter of his book ''[[Downsize This!]]'' to his efforts to get Dornan involuntarily committed for psychiatric examination.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Moore, ''Downsize This! Random Threats from an Unarmed American,&quot; Harper, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defeat==
Dornan's district had always been considered the only Orange County district where a Democrat had a realistic chance of winning.  However, it became even more Democratic after the 1990 Census, when it absorbed a considerably larger number of Latino voters than he had previously represented. After failing to win the GOP presidential nomination in 1996, Dornan ran for reelection to the House against [[Loretta Sanchez]], a Latina and former Republican who had switched parties and run as a Democrat. Dornan lost by 979 votes.

Following the narrow defeat, Dornan alleged that Sanchez's winning margin was provided by illegal voting from non-U.S. citizens.  A thirteen-month House of Representatives investigation ensued, during which Sanchez was seated provisionally, pending the inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061220/NEWS/612200531 HeraldTribune.com - News - News stories about Sarasota, Manatee and Charlotte counties in Florida, from the newspapers of record. - HeraldTribune.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  A task force found 748 votes that had been cast illegally—624 from non-citizens in addition to 124 that had already been thrown out by California officials.  This was not enough to overturn Sanchez' margin of victory and she was allowed to keep her seat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/02/13/cq/sanchez.html Proof Of Illegal Voters Falls Short, Keeping Sanchez In House - February 7, 1998&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, in consultation with the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service|INS]], the House committee identified as many as 4,700 questionable registration affidavits.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, Peter (1997), &quot;Signature Lists Sought in Sanchez Probe&quot; ''Los Angeles Times'' November 17: A1.&lt;/ref&gt; The probe was dropped before these affidavits could be investigated.

==Attempt to revive political career==
Dornan sought a rematch against Sanchez in 1998, but was badly defeated.

In 2004, Dornan challenged Congressman [[Dana Rohrabacher]], a fellow Republican, in the primary. Dornan charged Rohrabacher with being soft on terrorism and being too close to Islamic extremists. However, he lost by an 84% to 16% margin. Dornan remained in his [[Virginia]] home, appearing at conservative functions and conservative talk radio shows. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

During the summer of 2005, Dornan briefly expressed interest in the [[California 48th Congressional District Election, 2005|48th Congressional District]] seat that became vacant when [[Christopher Cox]] resigned to become [[Chairman]] of the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]]. He was interested in running as the nominee of the [[American Independent Party]], but was rebuffed by party leaders in Orange County.

In December 2005, Dornan substituted for radio talk show host [[Michael Savage (commentator)|Michael Savage]], criticizing [[George W. Bush]] for not moving for a formal [[Declaration of War]] after [[9/11]]. He did so again on 12 April 2006. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Dornan currently works with the [[American Life League]], his primary mission as a member of the American Life League team will be refocusing attention on the Right to Life Act, a proposal that establishes the personhood of each human being as beginning at fertilization.
