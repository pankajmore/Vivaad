{{Segregation}}
{{Discrimination sidebar}}
'''Racial segregation''' is the separation of humans into [[race (human classification)|racial group]]s in daily life. It may apply to activities such as eating in a restaurant, drinking from a water fountain, using a public toilet, attending school, going to the movies, or in the rental or purchase of a home.&lt;ref&gt;''Principles to Guide Housing Policy at the Beginning of the Millennium'', Michael Schill &amp; Susan Wachter, [[Cityscape]]&lt;/ref&gt; Segregation itself is defined by the [[European Commission against Racism and Intolerance]] as &quot;the act by which a (natural or legal) person separates other persons on the basis of one of the enumerated grounds without an objective and reasonable justification, in conformity with the proposed definition of discrimination. As a result, the voluntary act of separating oneself from other persons on the basis of one of the enumerated grounds does not constitute segregation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/ecri/activities/GPR/EN/Recommendation_N7/Recommendation_7_en.asp ECRI General Policy Recommendation N°7: National legislation to combat racism and racial discrimination] — Explanatory memorandum, Para. 16&lt;/ref&gt; According to the UN Forum on Minority Issues, &quot;The creation and development of classes and schools providing education in minority languages should not be considered impermissible segregation, if the assignment to such classes and schools is of a voluntary nature&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/10session/A.HRC.10.11.Add.1.pdf Recommendations of the Forum on Minority Issues A/HRC/10/11/Add.1] — para. 27&lt;/ref&gt; 

Racial segregation is generally outlawed, but may exist through social norms, even when there is no strong individual preference for it, as suggested by [[Thomas Schelling]]'s models of segregation and subsequent work.  Segregation may be maintained by means ranging from discrimination in hiring and in the rental and sale of housing to certain races to [[vigilante]] violence (such as [[lynching]]s, e.g.) Generally, a situation that arises when members of different races mutually prefer to associate and do business with members of their own race would usually be described as ''separation'' or ''[[de facto]] separation'' of the races rather than ''segregation''. In the United States, legal segregation  was required in some states and came with &quot;[[anti-miscegenation laws]]&quot; (prohibitions against [[interracial marriage]]).&lt;ref&gt;E.g., Virginia [[Racial Integrity Act]], Virginia Code § 20–58 and § 20–59&lt;/ref&gt; Segregation, however, often allowed close contact in [[social hierarchy|hierarchical]] situations, such as allowing a person of one race to work as a servant for a member of another race. Segregation can involve [[wiktionary:spatial|spatial]] separation of the races, and/or mandatory use of different institutions, such as schools and hospitals by people of different races.

==Historical cases==
Racial segregation has appeared in all parts of the world where there are multiracial communities. Where racial amalgamation has occurred on a large scale, as in Hawaii and Brazil, there was no legal segregation, however, there has been occasional social discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/488135/racial-segregation Racial segregation]. Britannica Online Encyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== A racial basis for the Indian caste system? ===
[[Indo-European]]-speaking nomadic groups from Europe, the Near East, Anatolia, and the Caucasus migrated to India. According to 19th century British historians, it was these &quot;Aryans&quot; who &quot;invaded&quot; India and established the [[caste system]], an [[elitist]] act of social organization that (according to the British) separated the &quot;light-skinned&quot; Indo-Aryan conquerors from the &quot;conquered dark-skinned&quot; indigenous [[Dravidian people|Dravidian]] tribes through enforcement of &quot;racial [[endogamy]]&quot;. This claim was used by the British, defining themselves as &quot;purely Aryan&quot;, to justify [[British Raj|British Rule in India]]. Much of this was simply [[conjecture]], fueled by [[British Empire|British]] [[imperialism]]&lt;ref name=&quot;NehruIndia&quot;&gt;From [[Discovery of India]] by [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], reproduced from &quot;History : Modern India&quot; (p108) by S.N. Sen, New Age Publishers, ISBN 81-224-1774-4.&lt;/ref&gt; British policies of [[divide and rule]] as well as enumeration of the population into rigid categories during the tenure of British rule in India contributed towards the hardening of these segregated caste identities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Corbridge |first=Staurt |coauthors=Harriss, John |title= Reinventing India: Liberalization, Hindu Nationalism and Popular Democracy|year=2000 |publisher= Polity press |page=8}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Since the independence of [[India]] from British rule, the British [[fantasy]] of an &quot;Aryan Invasion and subjugation of the dark skinned Dravidians in India&quot; has become a staple polemic in South Asian geopolitics, including the propaganda of [[Indophobia]] in Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ayesha Jalal]]. (1995). [http://www.jstor.org/sici?sici=0020-7438(199502)27:1%3C73:CPHAOI%3E2.0.CO;2-0 Conjuring Pakistan: History as Official Imagining]. ''International Journal of Middle East Studies''. 27(1). pp. 73–89.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no decisive theory as to the origins of the caste system in India, and globally renowned historians and archaeologists like [[Jim Shaffer]], [[J.P. Mallory]], [[Edwin Bryant (author)|Edwin Bryant]], and others, have disputed the claim of &quot;Aryan Invasion&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
*[[Jim Shaffer]] – &quot;Current archaeological data do not support the existence of an Indo-Aryan or European invasion into South Asia any time in the pre- or protohistoric periods. Instead, it is possible to document archaeologically a series of cultural changes reflecting indigenous cultural developments from prehistoric to historic periods&quot;{{cite book |title = The Indo-Aryan Invasions : Cultural Myth and Archaeological Reality |author = Jim Shaffer}}
*[[J.P. Mallory]] – &quot;... the extraordinary difficulty of making a case for expansions from Andronovo to northern India, and that attempts to link the Indo-Aryans to such sites as the Beshkent and Vakhsh cultures only gets the Indo-Iranian to Central Asia, but not as far as the seats of the Medes, Persians or Indo-Aryans&quot;. As quoted in Bryant (see below)
*[[Edwin Bryant (author)|Edwin Bryant]] – &quot;India is not the only Indo-European-speaking area that has not revealed any archaeological traces of immigration.&quot;there is at least a series of archaeological cultures that can be traced approaching the Indian subcontinent, even if discontinuous, which does not seem to be the case for any hypothetical east-to-west emigration&quot;

Chaudhuri]] still maintain the old-style colonialist narrative that the Aryans were Germannic Europeans who invaded India and conspired to create the &quot;caste system&quot; and &quot;Hinduism&quot; in order to secure their position in the region against the so-called &quot;aboriginals&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Hinduism and the Aboriginals&quot;, ''Hinduism: A Religion to Live By'', Oxford University Press, USA; New Edition, 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;97.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some researchers from India, Europe and the U.S. claim that genetic similarities to Europeans were more common in members of the higher ranks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/full/11/6/994 Genetic Evidence on the Origins of Indian Caste Populations – Bamshad et al. 11 (6): 994]. [[Genome Research]].&lt;/ref&gt; Their findings, published in ''[[Genome Research]]'', claimed the idea that members of higher castes are more closely related to Europeans than are the lower castes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=scientists-connect-indian Scientists Connect Indian Castes and European Heritage].

A study conducted by the [[Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology]] in 2009 (in collaboration with [[Harvard Medical School]], [[Harvard School of Public Health]] and the [[Broad Institute of Harvard]] and [[MIT]]) analyzed half a million genetic markers across the genomes of 132 individuals from 25 ethnic groups from 13 states in India across multiple caste groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/scitech/report_indians-are-one-people-descended-from-two-tribes_1292864 |title=Indians are one people descended from two tribes |publisher=Dnaindia.com |date=25 September 2009 |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study establishes, based on the impossibility of identifying any genetic indicators across caste lines, that castes in South Asia grew out of traditional tribal organizations during the formation of Indian society, and was not the product of any mythical &quot;Aryan Invasion&quot; and &quot;subjugation&quot; of Dravidian people, unlike what British racial-[[revanchist]] and [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|revisionist]] claims would have one believe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/news/india/Aryan-Dravidian-divide-a-myth-Study/articleshow/5053274.cms Aryan-Dravidian divide a myth: Study], [[Times of India]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewish segregation===
Jews in Europe generally were forced, by decree or by informal pressure, to live in highly segregated [[ghettos]] and [[shtetls]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Wirth, Louis]]. ''The Ghetto''. Transaction Publishers (1997), pp. 29–40. ISBN 1-56000-983-7.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1204 the [[papacy]] required Jews to segregate themselves from Christians and to wear distinctive clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.kenyon.edu/projects/margin/jew.htm |title=A Short History of the Jewish Tradition |publisher=.kenyon.edu |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forced segregation of Jews spread throughout Europe during the 14th and 15th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/232679/ghetto Ghetto]. Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Russian Empire]], Jews were restricted to the so-called [[Pale of Settlement]], the Western frontier of the Russian Empire corresponding roughly to the modern-day countries of Poland, Lithuania, Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Encyclop&amp;aelig;dia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-215022/anti-Semitism |title=Anti-Semitism in modern Europe |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 20th century, the majority of European Jews lived in the Pale of Settlement.

Jewish population were confined to [[mellah]]s in [[Morocco]] beginning from the 15th century. In cities, a ''mellah'' was surrounded by a wall with a fortified gateway. In contrast, rural ''mellahs'' were separate villages inhabited solely by the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sefarad.org/publication/lm/017/morocco.html |title=The Jews of Morocco, by Ralph G. Bennettett |publisher=Sefarad.org |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the middle of the 19th century, [[J. J. Benjamin]] wrote about the life  of [[History of Jews in Iran|Persian Jews]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;…they are obliged to live in a separate part of town…; for they are considered as unclean creatures…  Under the pretext of their being unclean, they are treated with the greatest severity and should they enter a street, inhabited by Mussulmans, they are pelted by the boys and mobs with stones and dirt…  For the same reason, they are prohibited to go out when it rains; for it is said the rain would wash dirt off them, which would sully the feet of the Mussulmans…  If a Jew is recognized as such in the streets, he is subjected to the greatest insults.  The passers-by spit in his face, and sometimes beat him… unmercifully…  If a Jew enters a shop for anything, he is forbidden to inspect the goods… Should his hand incautiously touch the goods, he must take them at any price the seller chooses to ask for them... Sometimes the Persians intrude into the dwellings of the Jews and take possession of whatever please them. Should the owner make the least opposition in defense of his property, he incurs the danger of atoning for it with his life... If... a Jew shows himself in the street during the three days of the Katel (Muharram)…, he is sure to be murdered.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1984), pp. 181–183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Canada===
In Canada, the [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] tribe of [[Kahnawake]] has been criticized for evicting non-Mohawks from the Mohawk reserve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalpost.com/news/canada/story.html?id=2529314#ixzz0gEyxbZlC |title=Natives only, please: A look into the eviction of non-natives from the Kahnawake reserve |work=National Post |location=Canada |accessdate=15 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mohawks who marry outside of their race lose their right to live in their homelands.&lt;ref name=&quot;nationalpost.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalpost.com/news/a9/3288607/story.html |title=Mohawk role model faces eviction over non-native fiancé |work=National Post |location=Canada |accessdate=15 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;thestar.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/768952--evicting-26-non-natives-splits-reserve | location=Toronto | work=The Star | first=Richard | last=Brennan | title=Evicting 26 non-natives splits reserve | date=21 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mohawk government claims that its policy of racially exclusive membership is for the preservation of its identity,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalpost.com/news/canada/native+Then+leave+reserve+Mohawks/2515716/story.html |title=Not native?

Although some concerned Mohawk citizens have contested the racially-exclusive membership policy, the [[Canadian Human Rights Tribunal]] has ruled that the Mohawk government may adopt policies it deems necessary to ensure the survival of its people.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

A long standing practice of segregation has also been imposed upon the commercial salmon fishery in British Columbia since 1992 when separate commercial fisheries were created for select aboriginal groups on three B.C. river systems.  Canadians of other races who fish in the separate fisheries have been arrested, jailed and prosecuted.  Although the fishermen who were prosecuted were successful at trial (see the decision in R. v. Kapp),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.provincialcourt.bc.ca/judgments/pc/2003/02/p03_0279.htm |title=R. v. Kapp et al – Reasons for Judgment |publisher=Provincialcourt.bc.ca |accessdate=15 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the decision was overturned on appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courts.gov.bc.ca/jdb-txt/sc/04/09/2004bcsc0958.htm |title=2004 BCSC 958 R. v. Kapp et al |publisher=Courts.gov.bc.ca |date=12 July 2004 |accessdate=15 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On final appeal, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in favour of the program on the grounds that segregation of this workplace is a step towards equality in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/2008/2008scc41/2008scc41.htm ]{{dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Affirmative action programs in Canada are protected from equality rights challenges by s. 15(2) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  The segregation continues today though more than 35 percent of the fishermen in the B.C. commercial fishery are of aboriginal ancestry, yet Canadians of aboriginal ancestry comprise less than 4 percent of B.C.'s population.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Canada also systematically forced [[First Nations]] children to attend [[Canadian Indian residential school system]] in order to disconnect them from their indigenous language and culture.

Since the 1970s, there has only been a concern expressed by some academics that major Canadian cities are becoming more segregated on income and ethnic lines.  Reports have indicated that the inner suburbs of post-merger Toronto&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/03/12/vancouver-income-inequality-study_n_1334796.html&lt;/ref&gt; and the southern bedroom communities of Greater Vancouver&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/03/12/vancouver-income-inequality-study_n_1334796.html&lt;/ref&gt; have become steadily more immigrant and [[visible minority]] dominated communities and have laged other neighbourhoods in average income.  A CBC panel in Vancouver in 2012 discussed the growing public fear that the profileration of [[ethnic enclaves]] in Greater Vancouver (e.g. Han Chinese in [[Richmond, BC|Richmond]], Punjabis [[Surrey, BC|Surrey]]) amounted to a type of [[self-segregation]].  In response to theses fears, many minority activists have pointed out that most Canadian neighbourhoods remain predominately White, and yet Whites are never accused of &quot;self-segregation&quot;, rather the

===China===

====Tang dynasty====
Several laws enforcing racial segregation of foreigners from Chinese were passed by the [[Han chinese]] during the [[Tang dynasty]]. In 779 the Tang dynasty issued an edict which forced [[Uyghur people|Uighurs]] to wear their ethnic dress, stopped them from marrying Chinese females, and banned them from pretending to be Chinese. Chinese disliked Uighurs because they practiced [[usury]]. The magristrate who issued the orders may have wanted to protect &quot;purity&quot; in Chinese custom. In 836 Lu Chun was appointed as governor of Canton, he was disgusted to find Chinese living with foreigners and intermarriage between Chinese and foreigners.

====Qing dynasty====
The [[Qing Dynasty]] was founded not by the Han Chinese who form the majority of the Chinese population, but the Manchus, who are today an ethnic minority of China.  The [[Manchu people|Manchu]]s were keenly aware of their minority status and during the early eras of their reign, they implemented a strict policy of racial segregation between the Manchus and Han Chinese. This ethnic segregation had cultural and economic reasons: intermarriage was forbidden to keep up the Manchurian heritage and minimize [[sinicization]].  Han Chinese and Mongols [[Willow Palisade|were banned]] from settling in Manchuria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~inaasim/Mingqing04/Qing2.htm |title=From Ming to Qing |publisher=Darkwing.uoregon.edu |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Qing Dynasty started [[Chuang Guandong|colonizing Manchuria with Han Chinese]] later on in the dynasty's rule, but the Manchu area was still separated from modern-day Inner Mongolia by the [[Willow Palisade|Outer Willow Palisade]], which kept the Manchu and the Mongols in the area separate.

The policy of segregation applied directly to the [[Eight Banners|banner]] garrisons, most of which occupied a separate walled zone within the cities in which they were stationed. While the Manchus followed the governmental structure of the preceding [[Ming dynasty]], their ethnic policy dictated that appointments were split between Manchu noblemen and Han Chinese officials who had passed the highest levels of the [[Imperial examinations|state examinations]], and because of the small number of Manchus, this insured that a large fraction of them would be government officials.

===England and Ireland===
Segregation may have existed in early [[Timeline of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon England]], restricting intermarriage and resulting in the displacement of the native [[Brython|British]] population by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] incomers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/07/060721-england.html |title=Ancient Britain Had Apartheid-Like Society, Study Suggests |publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to research led by the [[University College London]], Anglo-Saxon settlers enjoyed substantial social and economic advantages over [[Celt|Celtic Britons]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Mark G. et al.

''[[Proceedings of the Royal Society]] B: Biological Sciences'' 273(1601): 2651–2657.&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Stephen Oppenheimer]] and [[Bryan Sykes]] argue that there was no population displacement, as the Anglo-Saxons had relatively little genetic impact on England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2006/09/blood_of_the_british.php |title=Gene Expression: Blood of the Wakas Wakas |publisher=Scienceblogs.com |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/article_details.php?search_term=oppenheimer&amp;id=7817 |title=Special report: 'Myths of British ancestry' by Stephen Oppenheimer &amp;#124; Prospect Magazine October 2006 issue 127 |publisher=Prospect-magazine.co.uk |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the [[BBC]] used the headline &quot;English and Welsh are races apart&quot; to report a genetic survey of test subjects from [[market town]]s in England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/2076470.stm &quot;English and Welsh are Races Apart&quot;], ''[[BBC]]'', 30 June 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Statutes of Kilkenny]] were a series of thirty-five acts passed at [[Kilkenny]] in 1366. They forbad the intermarriage between the native Irish and the English settlers in Ireland, the English fostering of Irish children, the English adoption of Irish children and use of Irish names and dress.&lt;ref&gt;Simms, Katherine. &quot;Gaelicization.&quot; Medieval Ireland An Encyclopedia. 1st ed.

===Germany===

[[File:No entrance for poles1.jpeg|thumb|German warning in occupied Poland 1939 - &quot;No entrance for Poles!&quot;]]
In the early 14th century, some [[guild]]s in the cities of North-East Germany introduced statutes, under which persons of [[Wends|Wend]]ish, i.e. [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]], origin were forbidden from joining the guild.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.ifl-leipzig.com/fileadmin/daten/downloads/DOWNLOADCENTER/Publikationen/internationale%20Zusammenfassungen%20Europa%20Regional/2002/Heft2/en.pdf The Situation with the Sorbs in the Past and Present]&quot; (pdf).&lt;/ref&gt; According to Wilhelm Raabe, ''&quot;down into the eighteenth century no German guild accepted a Wend.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;Raabe, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ban of interracial marriage was part of the [[Nuremberg Laws]] enacted by the [[Nazi Party|Nazis]] in Germany against the German Jewish community during the 1930s. The laws prohibited marriages between Jews and [[Aryan]] Germans, which were classified as different races.&lt;ref&gt;The Laws for the Protection of German Blood and German Honour (15 September 1935), section 1. &quot;Marriages between Jews and citizens of German or kindred blood are forbidden. Marriages concluded in defiance of this law are void, even if, for the purpose of evading this law, they were concluded abroad.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the General Government of occupied [[Poland]] in 1940, the Nazis divided the population into different groups, each with different rights, food rations, allowed housing strips in the cities, public transportation, etc. In an effort to split Polish identity they attempted to establish ethnic divisions of [[Kashubians]] and [[Gorals]] ([[Goralenvolk]]), based on these groups' alleged &quot;Germanic component&quot;.

During the 1930s and 1940s, Jews in Nazi-controlled states were made to wear yellow ribbons or stars of David, and were, along with [[Romani people|Romas]] (Gypsies), discriminated against by the racial laws. Jewish doctors and professors were not allowed to treat Aryan (effectively, [[gentile]]) patients or teach [[Aryan race|Aryan]] pupils, respectively.
The Jews were not allowed to use any public transportation, besides the ferry, and were able to shop only from 3–5 pm in Jewish stores.  After ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' (&quot;The Night of Broken Glass&quot;), the Jews were fined 1,000,000 [[German reichsmark|marks]] for damages done by the Nazi troops and [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] members.

[[File:Lwow Ghetto (spring 1942).jpg|thumb|right|230px|Women behind the barbwire fence of the [[Lvov Ghetto]] in occupied Poland. Spring 1942]]
Jews and Roma were subjected to [[genocide]] as &quot;undesirable&quot; &quot;racial&quot; groups in the [[Holocaust]]. The Nazis established [[Ghettos in occupied Europe 1939-1944|ghetto]]s to confine Jews and sometimes Romas into tightly packed areas of the cities of Eastern Europe, turning them into ''de facto'' [[concentration camp]]s. The [[Warsaw Ghetto]] was the largest of these ghettos, with 400,000 people.  The [[Ghetto Litzmannstadt]] was the second largest, holding about 160,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fcit.usf.edu/HOLOCAUST/timeline/ghettos.htm |title=Holocaust Timeline: The Ghettos |publisher=Fcit.usf.edu |date=23 November 1939 |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1939 and 1945, at least 1.5 million [[Poland|Polish]] citizens were transported to the Reich for [[forced labour]] (in all, about 12 million forced laborers were employed in the German war economy inside the [[Nazi Germany]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Michael Marek (nda) |url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,1757323,00.html |title=Final Compensation Pending for Former Nazi Forced Laborers |publisher=Dw-world.de |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://summeroftruth.org/enemy/barracks.html |title=Forced Labor at Ford Werke AG during the Second World War |publisher=Summeroftruth.org |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Nazi Germany also used forced laborers from Western Europe, [[Poles]], along with other Eastern Europeans viewed as racially inferior,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dac.neu.edu/holocaust/Hitlers_Plans.htm |title=Hitler’s Plans |publisher=Dac.neu.edu |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; were subject to deeper discriminatory measures. They were forced to wear identifying red tags with &quot;P&quot;s sewn to their clothing, subjected to a [[curfew]], and banned from [[public transportation]].

While the treatment of factory workers or farm hands often varied depending on the individual employer, Polish laborers as a rule were compelled to work longer hours for lower wages than Western Europeans – in many cities, they were forced to live in segregated barracks behind barbed wire. Social relations with [[Germans]] outside work were forbidden, and sexual relations (''Rassenschande'' or &quot;racial defilement&quot;) were punishable by death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.holocaust-trc.org/poles.htm |title=Poles: Victims of the Nazi Era |publisher=Holocaust-trc.org |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
In 1938, the [[Italian Fascism|fascist regime led by Benito Mussolini]] introduced a series of laws instituting an official segregationist policy in the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italian Empire]], especially aimed against the Jews. This policy enforced various segregationist norms, like the prohibition for Jews to teach or study in ordinary schools and universities, to own industries reputed of major national interest, to work as journalists, to enter the military, and to wed non-Jews.
Some of the immediate consequences of the introduction of the 'provvedimenti per la difesa della razza' (norms for the defence of the race) included many of the best Italian scientists leaving their job, or even Italy. Amongst these, world-renowned physicists [[Emilio Segrè]], [[Enrico Fermi]] (whose wife was Jewish), [[Bruno Pontecorvo]], [[Bruno Rossi]], [[Tullio Levi-Civita]], mathematicians [[Federigo Enriques]] and [[Guido Fubini]] and even the fascist propaganda director, art critic and journalist [[Margherita Sarfatti]], who was one of Mussolini's mistresses. [[Rita Levi-Montalcini]], who would successively win the [[Nobel Prize for Medicine]], was forbidden to work at the university. [[Albert Einstein]], upon approval of the racial law, resigned from honorary membership of the [[Accademia dei Lincei]].

Later, [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Fascist Italy]] participated actively in the persecution of the Italian Jews, arresting and handing over tens of thousands of Jews to [[Nazi Germany]]. The persecution of the Jews ended in [[Southern Italy]] (controlled by the Kingdom of Italy) after the armistice with the Allies (8 September 1943), while in [[Central Italy|Central]] and [[Northern Italy]] (controlled by the [[Italian Social Republic]], a puppet state of Nazi Germany led by Mussolini) the persecution continued until the definitive fall of Mussolini's regime (25 April 1945).

===Latin America===
Spanish colonists created [[casta|caste systems]] in [[Latin American]] countries based on classification by race and race mixture.  An entire nomenclature developed, including the familiar terms &quot;[[mulatto]]&quot;, &quot;[[mestizo]]&quot;, and &quot;[[zambo]]&quot; (the latter the origin of &quot;[[sambo (racial term)|sambo]]&quot;).  The Spanish had practiced a form of caste system in [[Hispania]] prior to their expulsion of the Jews and Muslims. While many Latin American countries have long since rendered the system officially illegal through legislation, usually at the time of independence, [[prejudice]] based on degrees of perceived racial distance from European ancestry combined with one's socioeconomic status remain, an echo of the colonial caste system.&lt;ref&gt;Soong, Roland. [http://www.zonalatina.com/Zldata55.htm &quot;Racial Classifications in Latin America&quot;], 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cline, Howard F., [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0002-8762(197112)76%3A5%3C1626%3ARACILA%3E2.0.CO%3B2-6 &quot;Review&quot;], ''The American Historical Review'', Vol. 76, No. 5 (Dec. 1971), 1626–1628.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norway===

On 16 May 1940 the ''[[Administrasjonsrådet]]'' asked [[Rikskommisariatet]] why radio receivers had been confiscated from Jews in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aftenposten.no/meninger/kronikker/Folk-frer-og-frifinnelse-6730068.html &quot;Population, Führer and acquittal. Racial segregation between Norwegian citizens quietly accepted May 17, 1940]&lt;/ref&gt; That ''Administrasjonsrådet'' thereafter &quot;quietly&quot; accepted&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aftenposten.no/meninger/kronikker/Folk-frer-og-frifinnelse-6730068.html&lt;/ref&gt; racial segregation between Norwegian citizens, has been claimed by [[Tor Bomann-Larsen]]. Furthermore he claimed that this segregation &quot;created a [[precedent]]. 2 years later ( with ''NS-styret'' in the ministries of Norway) [[Jewish deportees from Norway during World War II|Norwegian police picked up those who had listened to the radios at the addresses where radios were previously confiscated from Jews. November 26, 1942]] it was time for departure and extermination&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aftenposten.no/meninger/kronikker/Folk-frer-og-frifinnelse-6730068.html &quot;Saken dannet presedens. Drøye to år senere (og nå med NS-styret på plass i departementene) rykket norske politimyndigheter ut på ny, denne gang for å hente lytterne på de samme adresser som radioapparatene. 26. november 1942 var det tid for avreise og utradering. Men politifolkene hadde altså vært ute en vårdag før. Raseskillet mellom norske borgere var blitt stilltiende akseptert den 17. mai 1940.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rhodesia===
Following a dispute over the terms for the granting of full sovereignty, the British [[self-governing colony]] of [[Rhodesia]], governed by a predominantly white minority government, [[Unilateral Declaration of Independence|unilaterally declared independence]] in 1965. Led by Prime Minister [[Ian Smith]], it endured as an [[list of historical unrecognized states|unrecognized state]] under white rule for the next 14 years, with majority rule coming in 1979 with the [[Internal Settlement]] between Smith's government and moderate black nationalists, the associated [[Zimbabwe Rhodesia general election, 1979|multiracial]] elections and the reconstitution of the country as [[Zimbabwe Rhodesia]], with Bishop [[Abel Muzorewa]] at the helm of a [[Government of Zimbabwe Rhodesia|coalition cabinet]] comprising 12 blacks and five whites. This new order also failed to gain legitimacy in the eyes of the world, and British control returned to the country in December 1979, following the [[Lancaster House Agreement]]. New elections were held [[Southern Rhodesian general election, 1980|in 1980]], and Zimbabwe gained recognized independence in April 1980, with [[Robert Mugabe]] as prime minister. 

[[File:DurbanSign1989.jpg|thumb|upright|right|&quot;Petty [[apartheid]]&quot;: sign on Durban beach in English, [[Afrikaans]] and [[Zulu language]]s]]
Laws enforcing segregation had been around before 1965, although many institutions simply ignored them. One highly publicized legal battle occurred in 1960 involving the opening of a new theatre that was to be open to all races; the proposed unsegregated restrooms at the newly-built [[Reps Theatre]] in 1959 caused an argument called &quot;The Battle of the Toilets&quot;.

===South Africa===
{{Main|South Africa under apartheid}}
The [[Apartheid]] system enacted a nation-wide social policy &quot;[[separate development]]&quot; with the National Party victory in 1948, following the &quot;colour bar&quot;-discriminatory legislation dating back to the beginning of the [[Union of South Africa]] and the Boer republics before which, while repressive to black South Africans along with other minorities, had not gone nearly so far. 

[[South_Africa_under_apartheid#Internal_resistance|Apartheid]] laws can be generally divided into following acts. Firstly, the Population Registration Act in 1950 classified residents in South Africa into four racial groups: &quot;black&quot;, &quot;white&quot;, &quot;colored&quot;, and &quot;Indian&quot; and noted their racial identities on their identifications. Secondly, the Group Areas Act in 1950 assigned different regions according to different races. People were forced to live in their corresponding regions and the action of passing the boundaries without a permit was made illegal, extending pass laws that had already curtailed black movement. Thirdly, Under the Reservation of Separate Amenities Act in 1953, amenities in public area, like hospitals, universities and parks, were labeled separately according to particular races. What is more, the Bantu Education Act in 1953 segregated national education in South Africa as well.

Uprisings and protests against [[Apartheid]] appeared immediately when [[Apartheid]] arose. As early as 1949, the youth wing of the African National Congress (ANC) advocated the abolishment of [[Apartheid]] and suggested fighting against racial segregation by various methods. During the following decades, hundreds of anti-Apartheid actions occurred, including those of the Black Consciousness Movement, students’ protests, labor strikes, and church group activism etc. In 1994, Nelson Mandela won in the first multiracial democratic election in South Africa. His success fulfilled the ending of [[Apartheid]] in South African history.

===United States===
{{Main|Racial segregation in the United States}}

After the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] abolished [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] in America, racial discrimination became regulated by the so-called [[Jim Crow laws]], which mandated strict segregation of the races. Though such laws were instituted shortly after fighting ended in many cases, they only became formalized after the end of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]-enforced [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] in the 1870s and 80s during a period known as the [[nadir of American race relations]]. This legalized segregation lasted up to the mid 1960s.
[[File:Segregation 1938b.jpg|thumb|left|thumb|An African-American youth at a segregated drinking fountain in [[Halifax, North Carolina]], in 1938.]]
While the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] majority in 1896 ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson|Plessy]]'' explicitly upheld only &quot;[[separate but equal]]&quot; facilities (specifically, transportation facilities), Justice [[John Marshall Harlan]] in his [[dissenting opinion|dissent]] protested that the decision was an expression of [[white supremacy]]; he predicted that segregation would &quot;stimulate aggressions … upon the admitted rights of colored citizens,&quot; &quot;arouse race hate&quot; and &quot;perpetuate a feeling of distrust between [the] races. Feelings between whites and blacks were so tense, even the jails were segregated.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20040503/fonerkennedy |title=Brown at 50 |publisher=Thenation.com |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Eric Foner and Randall Kennedy, &quot;Brown at 50&quot;, ''The Nation'', posted 15 April 2004 (3 May 2004 issue)--&gt;

Institutionalized racial segregation was ended as an official practice by the efforts of such [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|civil rights]] [[activism|activists]] as [[Clarence M. Mitchell, Jr.]], [[Rosa Parks]] and [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], working during the period from the end of World War II through the passage of the [[Voting Rights Act]] and the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] supported by President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. Many of their efforts were acts of [[Nonviolence|non-violent]] [[civil disobedience]] aimed at disrupting the enforcement of racial segregation rules and laws, such as refusing to give up a seat in the black part of the bus to a white person ([[Rosa Parks]]), or holding [[sit-in]]s at all-white [[wikt:diner|diners]].

By 1968 all forms of segregation had been declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, and by 1970 support for formal legal segregation had dissolved. [[Brown v. Board of Education]] of Topeka, [[Kansas]] in 1954 outlawed segregation in public schools. The [[Fair Housing Act]] of 1968, administered and enforced by the [[Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity]], prohibited discrimination in the sale and rental of housing on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, and disability.  Formal racial discrimination was illegal in school systems, businesses, the American military, other civil services and the government. Separate bathrooms, water fountains and schools all disappeared and the civil rights movement had the public's support.

===Bahrain===
{{See also|Oppression of Shia in Bahrain|Bandargate scandal|Human_rights_in_Bahrain#Migrant_workers|l3=Migrant workers}}
On 28 April 2007, the [[Council of Representatives of Bahrain|lower house]] of [[National Assembly of Bahrain|Bahraini Parliament]] passed a law banning unmarried migrant workers from living in residential areas. To justify the law MP Nasser Fadhala, a close ally of the government said &quot;bachelors also use these houses to make alcohol, run prostitute rings or to rape children and housemaids&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;migrantworkers3&quot;/&gt; 

Sadiq Rahma, technical committee head, who is a member of [[Al Wefaq]] said: &quot;The rules we are drawing up are designed to protect the rights of both the families and the Asian bachelors (..) these labourers often have habits which are difficult for families living nearby to tolerate (..) they come out of their homes half dressed, brew alcohol illegally in their homes, use prostitutes and make the neighbourhood dirty (..) these are poor people who often live in groups of 50 or more, crammed into one house or apartment,&quot; said Mr Rahma. &quot;The rules also state that there must be at least one bathroom for every five people (..) there have also been cases in which young children have been sexually molested.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GDN 23.1.2006&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author = [[Tariq Kkonji]] | url = http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/NewsDetails.aspx?storyid=133367 | title = 'No go' rule for bachelor labourers | publisher = [[Gulf Daily News]] | date=23 January 2006 | accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
India has passed multiple laws to penalise the caste system present in the society. These laws have been enshrined in the Indian constitution.

Some activists consider that the [[Indian caste system]] is a form of [[racial discrimination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;npr&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/programs/specials/racism/010828.caste.html |title=An Untouchable Subject? |publisher=Npr.org |date=29 August 2001 |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The participants of the United Nations Conference Against Racism in [[Durban]], South Africa in March 2001, condemned discrimination due to the caste system, and tried to pass a resolution declaring that caste as a basis for the segregation and oppression of peoples in terms of their descent and occupation is a form of [[apartheid]]. However, no formal resolution was passed to that effect&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hri.ca/racism/Submitted/Theme/castedeclaration.shtml Final Declaration of the Global Conference Against Racism and Caste-based Discrimination]{{Dead link|date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Treatment of Dalits by members of some upper castes has been described by some authors as &quot;India's hidden apartheid&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Gopal Guru, with Shiraz Sidhva.

Controversy exists as to whether caste-based discrimination is equivalent to racial discrimination. Such allegations have been rejected by some scholars such as [[Andre Béteille]], an Indian sociologist, who writes that treating caste as a form of racism is &quot;politically mischievous&quot; and worse, &quot;scientifically nonsense&quot; since there is no discernible difference in the racial characteristics between [[Brahmins]] and [[Scheduled Castes]]. While he admits the existence of caste-based discrimination, he writes that &quot;Every social group cannot be regarded as a race simply because we want to protect it against prejudice and discrimination&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wcar.alrc.net/mainfile2.php/For+the+negative/14/ Race and caste] by [[Andre Beteille]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pakistan]]i-American sociologist [[Ayesha Jalal]] also rejects these allegations. In her book, ''Democracy and Authoritarianism in South Asia'', she writes that &quot;As for [[Hinduism]], the hierarchical principles of the [[Brahmin|Brahmanical]] social order have always been contested from within Hindu society, suggesting that equality has been and continues to be both [[Hindu reform movements|valued and practiced]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;A.

===Israel===
[[Image:Barrier Gate at Bilin Palestine.jpg|thumb|right|A barrier gate at [[Bil'in]], [[West Bank]], 2006]]
South African Archbishop the Nobel peace laureate [[Desmond Tutu]] said he was &quot;very deeply distressed&quot; by a visit to the Holy Land, adding that &quot;it reminded me so much of what happened to us black people in South Africa&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1957644.stm Tutu condemns Israeli 'apartheid'] by [[BBC News]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Israeli Declaration of Independence]] proclaims equal rights to all citizens regardless of ethnicity, denomination or race.  Israel has a substantial list of laws that demand racial equality (such as prohibition of [[Prohibition of Discrimination in Products, Services and Entry into Places of Entertainment and Public Places Law, 2000|discrimination]],  [[Employment (Equal Opportunities) Law, 1988|equality in Employment]], libel based on race or ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%97%D7%95%D7%A7_%D7%90%D7%99%D7%A1%D7%95%D7%A8_%D7%9C%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9F_%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%A2|title= Section 1 of the Israeli ‘Libel Law 1965’ defines libel as a publication that may humiliate a person (individual or corporation) in the eyes of people, or to deem him/her/it object of hatred, contempt or ridicule their part; degrade a person for the acts, conduct or attributed qualities; damage ones job, whether public office or another job, damage ones business, trade, profession; degrade a person because of race, national origin, religion, place of residence, gender or sexual orientation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;). However due to many cultural differences, and animosity towards a minority perceived to wish to annihilate Israel, a system of passively co-existing communities, segregated along ethnic lines has emerged in Israel, with Arab-Israeli minority communities being left &quot;marooned outside the mainstream&quot;. 

Support for segregation and suspicion of Arabs in Israel is on the rise. A 2007 poll commissioned by the [[Center Against Racism]] (2008) found a worsening of Jewish citizens' perceptions of their Arab counterparts:&lt;ref name=&quot;autogeneratedil&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3381836,00.html |title= יותר ממחצית היהודים: נישואים לערבי הם בגידה – חדשות היום |publisher=ynet.co.il |date=27 March 2007 |accessdate=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, 75% of Israeli Jews would not agree to live in a building with Arab residents, 60% would not accept any Arab visitors at their homes, 40% believed that Arabs should be stripped of their right to vote, and 59% believe that the culture of Arabs is primitive.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogeneratedil&quot;/&gt;

Segregation of women in the [[Gender separation in Judaism|Jewish]] [[Orthodox Judaism|orthodox]] and [[Gender segregation and Islam|Muslim]]  [[Islamic fundamentalism|fundamentalist]]  minorities in Israel is becoming more and more of a problem. 
In the [[Israeli-occupied territories]] the situation is different, Israeli [[Israeli Military Orders]] apply; ethnic segregation exists supposedly on grounds of security measures. In the Jewish settlements, Palestinians are welcome only as workforce; they are often mistreated, and occasionally suffer violence. On the other hand Jews are not welcome in a Palestinian controlled territory. In few rare occasions when Jews entered by mistake they were, [[2000 Ramallah lynching|lynched]] or taken hostage. Jews and/or Israelis are banned by law from entering [[Freedom of religion in Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia]] unless approved by the king.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Prophets and Princes: Saudi Arabia from Muhammad to the Present | publisher=Wiley | author=Mark Weston, | authorlink=Mark Weston | pages=201 | isbn=978-0470182574}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malaysia===
{{Main|Bumiputra|Ketuanan Melayu}}
[[Malaysia]] has an [[Article 153 of the Constitution of Malaysia|article in its constitution]] which distinctly segregates the ethnic [[Malay people|Malay]]s and indigenous peoples of Malaysia—i.e. [[bumiputra]]—from the non-Bumiputra such as the Chinese and the [[Person of Indian Origin|East Indian]]s under the [[social contract (Malaysia)|social contract]], of which by law would guarantee the former certain special rights and privileges. To question these rights and privileges however is strictly prohibited under the Internal Security Act, legalised by the 10th Article(IV) of the Constitution of Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;[[Constitution of Malaysia#Article 10|Constitution of Malaysia, Article 10]]&lt;/ref&gt; The privileges mentioned herein covers—few of which—the economical and education aspects of Malaysians, e.g. the [[Malaysian New Economic Policy]]; an economic policy recently criticised by Thierry Rommel—who headed a European Commission's delegation to Malaysia—as an excuse for &quot;significant protectionism&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6237328.stm |title=Asia-Pacific |publisher=BBC News |date=25 June 2007 |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infernalramblings.com/articles/Malaysian_Politics/496/ |title=Infernal ramblings |publisher=Infernal ramblings |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a quota maintaining higher access of Malays into public universities. This system of segregation is seen as a form of apartheid by its opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.limkitsiang.com/2007/06/26/if-not-for-people-like-rommel-south-africa-would-still-have-apartheid/ |title=Blog entry 2007-06-26 |publisher=Blog.limkitsiang.com |date=26 June 2007 |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mauritania===
[[Slavery in Mauritania]] was finally criminalized in August 2007&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6938032.stm Mauritanian MPs pass slavery law] by [[BBC News]]&lt;/ref&gt; It was already abolished in 1980 though it was still affecting the descendants of black Africans abducted into slavery before generations, who live now in Mauritania as &quot;black [[Moors]]&quot; or ''haratin'' and who partially still serve the &quot;white Moors&quot;, or ''bidhan'' (the name means literally white-skinned people), as slaves. The number of slaves in the country was not known exactly, but is was estimated to be up to 600,000 men, women and children, or 20% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saiia.org.za/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1141 Mauritania made slavery illegal last month]{{Dead link|date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/specials/1458_abolition/page4.shtml The Abolition season] on [[BBC World Service]]&lt;/ref&gt;

For centuries, the so-called [[Haratin]] lower class, mostly poor black Africans living in rural areas, have been considered natural slaves by white Moors of Arab/Berber ancestry. Many descendants of the [[Arab]] and [[Berber people|Berber]] tribes today still adhere to the [[supremacist]] ideology of their ancestors. This ideology has led to oppression, discrimination and even enslavement of other groups in the region of [[Sudan]] and Western [[Sahara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?ReportId=70522 |title=Fair elections haunted by racial imbalance |publisher=Irinnews.org |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iabolish.org/slavery_today/in_depth/sudan-genocide.html |title=War and Genocide in Sudan |publisher=Iabolish.org |accessdate=18 January 2010 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070927031133/http://www.iabolish.org/slavery_today/in_depth/sudan-genocide.html |archivedate = 27 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In certain villages in [[Mauritania]] there are mosques for lighter-skinned nobles and mosques for black slaves, who are still buried in separate cemeteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=75756 |title=Mauritania: The real beginning of the end of slavery? |publisher=Irinnews.org |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Arab Emirates===
There is considerable racial segregation in the [[United Arab Emirates]], where there are areas that house large numbers of [[South Asian]] migrant workers (primarily [[India]]n, as well as [[Pakistan]], Bangladesh, [[Nepal]], and [[Sri Lanka]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://lib.ohchr.org/HRBodies/UPR/Documents/Session3/AE/Mafiwasta_ARE_UPR_S3_2008anx_EnforcingMigrantWorkersRightsinTheUnitedArabEmirates.pdf PDF document]&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

The United Kingdom has no legally sanctioned system of racial segregation and has a substantial list of laws that demand racial equality.  However due to many cultural differences a system of passively co-existing communities, segregated along racial lines has emerged in parts of the United Kingdom, with minority communities being left &quot;marooned outside the mainstream”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4273414.stm |work=BBC News | title=Britons warned over 'segregation' | date=22 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The affected and ‘ghettoised’ communities are often largely representative of [[Pakistanis]], Indians and other Sub-Continentals as well as [[British African-Caribbean community|Afro-Caribbeans]] and other [[Black people|blacks]], with skin colour often being a determinant, although the percentage of The United Kingdom's working and poorer class is predominantly white.  Such racial segregation has widely been thought to be the basis of growing ethnic tensions, a measurable deterioration in race relations in poorer areas, a deterioration of the [[standard of living]] and levels of education and employment among ethnic minorities in poorer areas as well as being a main precursor to recent [[race riot]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1702799.stm |work=BBC News | title=Race 'segregation' caused riots | date=11 December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ccsr.ac.uk&quot;&gt;[http://www.ccsr.ac.uk/staff/Ludi/documents/UrbS_41_3_2004.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;  Most British commentators claim it is false the riots were due to a breakdown of multiculturalism alone and instead is more likely to have been caused by other factors such as disillusioned youth, high unemployment and a growing attraction to 'gangsta' culture by a sizeable proportion of the youth, across all ethnicities, of The United Kingdom.

There may be some indication that such segregation, particularly in residential terms, seems to be the result of the unilateral ‘steering’ of ethnic groups into particular areas as well as a culture of vendor discrimination and distrust of ethnic minority clients by some estate agents and other property professionals.&lt;ref&gt;PHILLIPS, D. (2002) Movement to opportunity? South Asian relocation in northern cities. End of Award report, ESRC R000238038. School of Geography, University of Leeds. Pg.7.&lt;/ref&gt; This may be indicative of a market preference amongst the more wealthy to reside in areas of less ethnic mixture; less ethnic mixture being perceived as increasing the value and desirability of a residential area.  This is likely as other theories such as “ethnic [[Auto-segregation|self segregation]]” have sometimes been shown to be baseless, and a majority of ethnic respondents to a few surveys on the matter have been in favour of wider social and residential integration.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccsr.ac.uk&quot;/&gt;

===United States===
[[De facto#Segregation (during the Civil Rights Era in the United States)|De facto segregation]] in the United States has increased since the [[Civil rights movement|civil rights era]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=Kozol2005&gt;{{cite book|last=Kozol|first=Jonathan|title=The Shame of the Nation|year=2005|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-4000-5245-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court ruled in [[Milliken v. Bradley]] (1974) that de facto racial segregation was acceptable, as long as schools were not actively making policies for racial exclusion; since then, schools have been segregated due to myriad indirect factors.&lt;ref name=Kozol2005/&gt;

[[Redlining]] is the practice of denying or increasing the cost of services, such as banking, insurance, access to jobs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.core.ucl.ac.be/services/psfiles/dp99/dp9913.pdf |title=Racial Discrimination and Redlining in Cities |format=PDF |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; access to health care,&lt;ref&gt;See: [[Race and health]]&lt;/ref&gt;  or even supermarkets&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/ptc5hvexthe7wrye/ In poor health: Supermarket redlining and urban nutrition], Elizabeth Eisenhauer, [[GeoJournal]] 	Volume 53, Number 2 / February 2001&lt;/ref&gt; to residents in certain, often racially determined,&lt;ref name=&quot;eastny&quot;&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=TWo8OFJpFtAC How East New York Became a Ghetto] by Walter Thabit. ISBN 0-8147-8267-1. Page 42.&lt;/ref&gt; areas. The most devastating form of redlining, and the most common use of the term, refers to [[Mortgage Discrimination|mortgage discrimination]]. Over the next twenty years, a succession of further court decisions and federal laws, including the ''[[Home Mortgage Disclosure Act]]'' and measure to end [[Mortgage Discrimination|mortgage discrimination]] in 1975, would completely invalidate ''[[de jure]]'' racial segregation and discrimination in the U.S., although ''de facto'' segregation and discrimination have proven more resilient.  According to the Civil Rights Project at [[Harvard University]], the actual de facto desegregation of U.S. public schools peaked in the late 1980s; since that time, the schools have, in fact, become more segregated mainly due to the ethnic segregation of the nation with whites dominating the suburbs and minorities the urban centers. According to Rajiv Sethi, an economist at Columbia University, black-white segregation in housing is slowly declining for most metropolitan areas in the US&lt;ref&gt;''Inequality and Segregation''

ISBN 1-56639-147-4&lt;/ref&gt;  Thirty years (the year 2000) after the civil rights era, the United States remained in many areas a residentially segregated society, in which blacks, whites and [[Hispanics in the United States|Hispanics]] inhabit different neighborhoods of vastly different quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/meltingpot/melt0222.htm |title=Myth of the Melting Pot: America's Racial and Ethnic Divides |publisher= Washington post.com |date=22 February 1998 |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Massey Douglas S.

The desire of many whites to avoid having their children attend integrated schools has been a factor in [[white flight]] to the suburbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761580651_3/Segregation_in_the_United_States.html#s15 |title=VI  De Facto Segregation  |accessdate=9 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 study in San Francisco showed that groups of homeowners of all races tended to self-segregate in order to be with people of the same education level and race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bayer|first=Patrick|coauthors=Fernando Ferreira, and Robert McMillan|title=A Unified Framework for Measuring Preferences for Schools and Neighborhoods|journal=Journal of Political Economy|year=2007|month=August|volume=115|issue=4|pages=588–638|doi=10.1086/522381|url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=466280}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1990, the legal barriers enforcing segregation had been mostly replaced by decentralized racism, where whites pay more than blacks to live in predominantly white areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;vigdor&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cutler|first=David M.|coauthors=Edward L. Glaeser, and Jacob L.

Equivalent housing in white areas commands a higher rent. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kiel K.A., Zabel J.E. |title=Housing Price Differentials in U.S. Cities: Household and Neighborhood Racial Effects |journal=Journal of Housing Economics |volume=5 |year=1996 |page=143 |doi=10.1006/jhec.1996.0008 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; These higher rents are largely attributable to [[exclusionary zoning]] policies that restrict the supply of housing. Regulations ensure that all housing units are expensive enough to prevent access by undesirable groups. By bidding up the price of housing, many white neighborhoods effectively shut out blacks, because blacks are unwilling, or unable, to pay the premium to buy entry into these expensive neighborhoods. Conversely, equivalent housing in black neighborhoods is far more affordable to those who are unable or unwilling to pay a premium to live in white neighborhoods. Through the 1990s, residential segregation remained at its extreme and has been called &quot;[[hypersegregation]]&quot; by some sociologists or &quot;American Apartheid&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Massey D.S., Denton N. A. |title=American Apartheid. |place=Cambridge |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2005, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in ''Johnson v. California'' {{ussc|543|499|2005}} that the California Department of Corrections' unwritten practice of racially segregating prisoners in its prison reception centers – which California claimed was for inmate safety (gangs in California, as throughout the U.S., usually organize on racial lines)— is to be subject to [[strict scrutiny]], the highest level of constitutional review.
