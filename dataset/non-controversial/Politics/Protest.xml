A '''protest''' is an expression of objection, by words or by actions, to particular events, policies or situations. Protests can take many different forms, from individual statements to mass demonstrations. Protesters may organize a protest as a way of publicly making their opinions heard in an attempt to influence public opinion or [[government]] policy, or they may undertake [[direct action]] in an attempt to directly enact desired changes themselves.&lt;ref&gt;St. John Barned-Smith, &quot;How We Rage: This Is Not Your Parents' Protest,&quot; ''Current'' (Winter 2007): 17-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Where protests are part of a systematic and peaceful campaign to achieve a particular objective, and involve the use of pressure as well as persuasion, they go beyond mere protest and may be better described as cases of [[civil resistance]] or [[nonviolent resistance]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam Roberts (scholar)|Adam Roberts]], Introduction, in Adam Roberts and Timothy Garton Ash (eds.), [http://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&amp;dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present''], Oxford University Press, 2009, pp. 2-3, where a more comprehensive definition of &quot;civil resistance&quot; may be found.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Various forms of self-expression and protest are sometimes restricted&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Controlling+public+protest%3a+First+Amendment+implications.-a016473804 | title = Controlling Public Protest: First Amendment Implications | accessdate = 2009-12-16 | author = Daniel L. Schofield, S.J.D. | date=November 1994 | publisher= in the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]'s ''[[FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin|Law Enforcement Bulletin]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[government]]al policy, economic circumstances, religious orthodoxy, social structures, or [[mass media|media]] [[monopoly]]. When such restrictions occur, protests may assume the form of open [[civil disobedience]], more subtle forms of resistance against the restrictions, or may spill over into other areas such as [[culture]] and [[emigration]].

A protest can itself sometimes be the subject of a [[counter-protest]]. In such a case, counter-protesters demonstrate their support for the person, [[policy]], action, etc. that is the subject of the original protest.

==Historical notions==
[[File:9.12 tea party in DC.jpg|right|thumb|220px|Big government protesters fill the West Lawn of the [[U.S. Capitol]] and the [[National Mall]] on September 12, 2009.]]

Unaddressed protests may grow and widen into [[civil resistance]], [[dissent]], [[activism]], [[riot]]s, [[insurgency]], [[revolt]]s, and political and/or social [[revolution]]. Some examples of protests include:
* [[Northern Europe]] in the early 16th century ([[Protestant Reformation]])
* [[North America]] in the 1770s ([[American Revolution]])
* [[France]] in 1789 ([[French Revolution]])
* The [[Haymarket riot]], 1886, a violent labor protest led by the [[Anarchism in the United States|Anarchist Movement]]
* [[Martin Luther King]]'s 1963 [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]], a key moment in the [[American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|Civil Rights Movement]]
* SOS ([[Save Our Sons]]) an Australian [[Conscription in Australia|anti-conscription organization]]
* The [[Stonewall riots]] in 1969 protesting the treatment of homosexuals in [[New York City]]
* The [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]
* The many [[AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power|ACT-UP]] AIDS protests of the late 1980s and early 1990s
* The [[Seattle]] [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity]] against the [[World Trade Organization]]
* [[Anti-globalization Protests in Prague]] in 2000
* [[February 15, 2003 anti-war protest|Feb. 15, 2003 Iraq War Protest]]
* [[Tea Party protests]]
* Palestinian [[First Intifada]] [[Second Intifada]] 
* [[2011 Iranian protests]]
* [[Arab Spring |Arab Spring protests]]
* [[Impact of the Arab Spring]]
* [[Occupy Wall Street|2011 Occupy Wall Street protests]]

==Forms of protest==
{{seealso|Repertoire of contention}}
Commonly recognized forms of protest include:

===Public demonstration or political rally===
[[File:RNC2008 day2 protest by matt sandy.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Demonstrators marching outside the [[2008 Republican National Convention]] in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]].]]
[[File:Rally_Against_Asset_Sales,_Palmerston_North,_14_July_2012_07.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Protest march in [[Palmerston North|Palmerston North, New Zealand]].]]
[[File:Occupy the Dáil - We are the 99 per cent.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Protesters outside the [[Oireachtas]] in [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland]].]]
Some forms of [[direct action]] listed in this article are also [[Demonstration (people)|public demonstrations]] or rallies.
* [[Demonstration (people)|Protest march]], a historically and geographically common form of [[nonviolent]] action by groups of people.
* [[Picketing (protest)|Picketing]], a form of protest in which people congregate outside a place of work or location where an event is taking place. Often, this is done in an attempt to dissuade others from going in (&quot;crossing the picket line&quot;), but it can also be done to draw public attention to a cause.
* [[Street protester]]s, characteristically, work alone, gravitating towards areas of high foot traffic, and employing handmade [[wikt:placard|placards]] such as [[sandwich board]]s or picket signs in order to maximize exposure and interaction with the public.
* [[Lockdown]]s and [[lock-on]]s are a way to stop movement of an object, like a structure or tree and to thwart movement of actual protesters from the location. Users employ various chains, locks and even the [[sleeping dragon]] for impairment of those trying to remove them with a matrix of composted materials.
* [[Die-in]]s are a form of protest where participants simulate being dead (with varying degrees of realism). In the simplest form of a die-in, protesters simply lie down on the ground and pretend to be dead, sometimes covering themselves with signs or banners. Much of the effectiveness depends on the posture of the protesters, for when not properly executed, the protest might look more like a &quot;sleep-in&quot;. For added realism, simulated wounds are sometimes painted on the bodies, or (usually &quot;bloody&quot;) bandages are used.
* [[Protest song]] is a song which protests perceived problems in society. Every major movement in Western history has been accompanied by its own collection of protest songs, from slave [[emancipation]] to women's [[suffrage]], the [[labor movement]], [[civil rights]], the anti-war movement, the [[feminist]] movement, the environmental movement. Over time, the songs have come to protest more abstract, moral issues, such as [[injustice]], [[racial discrimination]], the morality of [[war]] in general (as opposed to purely protesting individual wars), [[globalization]], [[inflation]], [[social inequalities]], and [[incarceration]].
* [[Radical cheerleading]]. The idea is to ironically reappropriate the aesthetics of cheerleading, for example by changing the [[chant]]s to promote [[feminism]] and [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] causes. Many radical cheerleaders (some of whom are male, [[transgender]] or non-gender identified) are in appearance far from the stereotypical image of a cheerleader.
* &lt;!-- -Copied from Critical Mass wikipedia page April 2009- --&gt; [[Critical Mass]] bike rides have been perceived as protest activities. A 2006 ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' magazine article described Critical Mass' activity in [[New York City]] as &quot;monthly political-protest rides&quot;, and characterized Critical Mass as a part of a [[social movement]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Holy Rollers | first=Ben | last=Mcgrath | date=November 13, 2006 | url=http://www.newyorker.com/printables/fact/061113fa_fact}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[UK]] [[e-zine]] [[Urban75]], which advertises as well as publishes photographs of the Critical Mass event in [[London]], describes this as &quot;the monthly protest by cyclists reclaiming the streets of London.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Critical Mass London | publisher=[[Urban75]] | year=2006 | url=http://www.urban75.org/photos/critical}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Critical Mass participants have insisted that these events should be viewed as &quot;celebrations&quot; and spontaneous gatherings, and not as protests or organized demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Pittsburgh Critical Mass | url=http://pghcriticalmass.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Critical Mass: Over 260 Arrested in First Major Protest of RNC | date=August 30, 2004 | publisher=Democracy Now! | url=http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=04/08/30/1453256}}&lt;/ref&gt; This stance allows Critical Mass to argue a legal position that its events can occur without advance notification of local police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Critical crackdown | first=Matt | last=Seaton | publisher =The Guardian| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,3604,1600570,00.html | location=London | date=October 26, 2005 | accessdate=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=[*BCM*] Hong Kong Critical Mass News | first=Adam | last=Rosi-Kessel | date=August 24, 2004 | url=http://www.bostoncriticalmass.org/pipermail/bostoncriticalmass/2004-August/000146.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Toyi-toyi]] is a Southern African dance originally from [[Zimbabwe]] that became famous for its use in political protests in the apartheid-era South Africa, see [[Protest in South Africa]].

===In sports===
During a [[sport]]ing event, under certain circumstances, one side may choose to play a game &quot;under protest&quot;, usually when they feel the rules are not being correctly applied. The event continues as normal, and the events causing the protest are reviewed after the fact. If the protest is held to be valid, then the results of the event are changed. Each sport has different rules for protests.

==Economic effects of protests against companies==
A study of 342 US protests covered by the [[New York Times]] newspaper in the period 1962 and 1990 showed that such public activities usually had an impact on the company's publicly-traded [[stock]] price. The most intriguing aspect of the study's findings is that what mattered most was not the number of protest participants, but the amount of media coverage the event received. Stock prices fell an average of one-tenth of a percent for every paragraph printed about the event.&lt;ref&gt;[[Deseret Morning News]], 13 Nov. 2007 issue, p. E3, ''Coverage of protests hurts firms, Cornell-Y. study says'', Angie Welling&lt;/ref&gt;
