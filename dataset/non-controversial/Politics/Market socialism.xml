{{Socialism sidebar |expanded=Currents}}

'''Market socialism''' refers to various [[economic system]]s where the [[means of production]] are either publicly owned or cooperatively owned and operated for a profit in a [[market economy]]. The profit generated by the firms would be used to directly remunerate employees or would be the source of [[public finance]] or could be distributed amongst the population through a [[social dividend]].&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, Alan E. Ethics, Efficiency and the Market. Oxford University Press US. 1985. ISBN 978-0-8476-7396-4, [http://books.google.com/books?id=dqcoCqFrZFYC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;dq=ethics,efficiency+and+the+market+Two.types.of.market.socialism&amp;ei=04CPSsGIEJi-lATShbijBw#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false pp. 104-105]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century'', 2003, by Gregory and Stuart. ISBN 0-618-26181-8. (P.142): &quot;It is an economic system that combines social ownership of capital with market allocation of capital...The state owns the means of production, and returns accrue to society at large.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretically, the fundamental difference between market socialism and a [[Economic planning|non-market]] socialism is the existence of a market for the means of production and [[capital good]]s. Market socialism is distinguished from models of mixed economies, because unlike the [[mixed economy]], models of market socialism are complete and self-regulating systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Bockman|first= Johanna |title= Markets in the name of Socialism: The Left-Wing origins of Neoliberalism|publisher= Stanford University Press|year= 2011|month= |isbn= 978-0-8047-7566-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, market socialism is contrasted with [[Social democracy|social democratic]] policies implemented in capitalist market economies. While social democracy aims to achieve greater equality through taxes, subsidies and social welfare projects, market socialism does so through changes in patterns of enterprise ownership and management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Roosevelt|first= Frank |coauthors= David Belkin |title= [[Why Market Socialism?]] |publisher= [[M.E. Sharpe, Inc.]] |year= 1994|month= |isbn= 1-56324-465-9|page = 314|quote=Social democracy achieves greater egalitarianism via ex post government taxes and subsidies, where market socialism does so via ex ante changes in patterns of enterprise ownership.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Early forms of market socialism consisted of proposals for cooperative enterprises operating in a free-market economy, so that exploitation would be eliminated and individuals would receive the [[To each according to his contribution|full product of their labor]]. Early market socialism was expressed by [[Ricardian socialism|Ricardian socialist]]s, [[mutualism (economic theory)|mutualists]] and [[individualist anarchist]]s and was based on the theories of [[classical economics]].

Contemporary models of market socialism are based on [[neoclassical economic theory]] beginning in the early twentieth century. Early neoclassical models of socialism include a role for a central planning board (CPB) in setting prices to equal [[marginal cost]] in order to achieve [[pareto efficiency]]. Alternative models of market socialism outlined models where socially-owned enterprises operate [[free market]]s to maximize economic profit. In contemporary models proposed by economists such as [[John Roemer]] and James Yunker, public ownership is achieved through public ownership of equity.

Market socialism has also been used to refer to reformed economic systems in [[Marxist-Leninist]] [[Socialist state|states]], such as the [[People's Republic of China]], where a [[free price system]] is utilized for the allocation and distribution of all resources in the state sector. In this model, state ownership is reserved for &quot;strategic&quot; sectors of the economy. Within this model, the state would utilize indirect market mechanisms ([[fiscal policy|fiscal]], [[monetary policy|monetary]] and [[Industrial policy]]) to influence economic activity in the same manner governments affect economic decisions in capitalist economies, including the use of (external) regulation over the otherwise autonomously-operating state enterprises. However, proponents of this model do not consider it to be a form of market socialism in the neoclassical sense, and instead describe it as an alternative economic model called the &quot;[[socialist market economy]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nodo50.org/cubasigloXXI/congreso06/conf3_zhonquiao.pdf Market Economy and Socialist Road]'' Duan Zhongqiao&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theoretical history ==
{{Economics sidebar}}

===Classical economics===
Proponents of early free-market socialism include the [[Ricardian socialism|Ricardian socialist economists]], the classical liberal philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]], and the anarchist philosopher [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]].

This form of market socialism has been termed &quot;free market socialism&quot; because it does not involve planners.&lt;ref&gt;''Property and Prophets: the evolution of economic institutions and ideologies'', E. K. Hunt, published by M.E. Sharpe, ISBN 978-0-7656-0609-9, [http://books.google.com/books?id=fMGjVbg_mOAC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq=free.market.socialism&amp;ei=FYmPSp62D4rgkwTLjbyvBw#v=onepage&amp;q=free.market.socialism&amp;f=false p.72]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mutualist.blogspot.com/2006/07/js-mill-market-socialist.html Mutualist Blog: Free Market Anti-Capitalism: &quot;J.S. Mill, Market Socialist&quot;&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] developed a theoretical system called [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]], which attacks the legitimacy of existing [[property rights]], [[subsidies]], [[corporations]], [[banking]], and [[Renting|rent]]. Proudhon envisioned a decentralized market where people would enter the market with equal power, negating [[wage slavery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mutualist.blogspot.com/2006/01/eugene-plawiuk-on-anarchist-socialism.html Mutualist Blog: Free Market Anti-Capitalism: Eugene Plawiuk on Anarchist Socialism&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents believe that cooperatives, credit unions, and other forms of worker ownership would become viable without being subject to the [[Sovereign state|state]]. Market socialism has also been used to describe some [[individualist anarchist]] works&lt;ref&gt;Murray Bookchin, ''Ghost of Anarcho-Syndicalism''; [[Robert Graham (historian)|Robert Graham]], ''The General Idea of Proudhon's Revolution''.&lt;/ref&gt; which argue that free markets help workers and weaken capitalists.

===Neoclassical economics===
The earliest models of this form of market socialism were developed by [[Leon Walras]], [[Enrico Barone]] (1908)&lt;ref&gt;F. Caffé (1987), &quot;Barone, Enrico&quot;, ''The [[New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]]'', ISBN 978-1-56159-197-8, v. 1, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Enrico Barone, &quot;Il Ministro della Produzione nello Stato Collettivista&quot;, ''Giornale degli Economisti'', 2, pp. 267-293, trans. as &quot;The Ministry of Production in the Collectivist State&quot;, in [[F. A. Hayek]], ed. (1935), ''Collectivist Economic Planning'', ISBN 978-0-7100-1506-8 pp. 245-90.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Oskar R. Lange]] (c. 1936).&lt;ref&gt;Robin Hahnel (2005), ''Economic Justice and Democracy'', Routlege, ISBN 978-0-415-93344-5, [http://books.google.com/books?id=m3QMGLrRbSAC&amp;pg=PA170&amp;dq=%22Economic+Justice+and+Democracy%22+Hahnel+%22usually+called+market+socialist+models%22&amp;ei=VoSPSp_PK5iSlQSElPirBw#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false p. 170]&lt;/ref&gt; Lange and [[Fred M. Taylor]]&lt;ref&gt;Fred M. Taylor (1929). &quot;The Guidance of Production in a Socialist State&quot;, ''American Economic Review'', 19(1), [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0002-8282%28192903%2919%3A1%3C1%3ATGOPIA%3E2.0.CO%3B2-0&amp;size=LARGE&amp;origin=JSTOR-enlargePage pp. 1-8].&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that central planning boards set prices through &quot;trial and error&quot;, making adjustments as shortages and surpluses occurred rather than relying on a [[free price mechanism]]. If there were shortages, prices would be raised; if there were surpluses, prices would be lowered.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Skousen (2001), ''Making Modern Economics'', M.E. Sharpe, ISBN 978-0-7656-0479-8,[http://books.google.com/books?id=QV2OJqbt45oC&amp;pg=PA414&amp;dq=Skousen+%22Making+of+Modern+Economics%22+%22channeled+through+a+central+planning+board%22&amp;ei=hIaPSp7dMIvKlQTO4tixBw#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false pp. 414-415].&lt;/ref&gt; Raising the prices would encourage businesses to increase production, driven by their desire to increase their profits, and in doing so eliminate the shortage. Lowering the prices would encourage businesses to curtail production to prevent losses, which would eliminate the surplus. Therefore, it would be a simulation of the market mechanism, which Lange thought would be capable of effectively managing supply and demand.&lt;ref&gt;[[János Kornai]] (1992), ''The Socialist System: the political economy of communism'', Oxford University Press, ISBN 978-0-19-828776-6, p. 476.&lt;/ref&gt; 

H. D. Dickinson published two articles proposing a form of market socialism: &quot;Price Formation in a Socialist Community&quot; (''The Economic Journal'' 1933) and &quot;The Problems of a Socialist Economy&quot; (''The Economic Journal'' 1934). Dickinson proposed a mathematical solution whereby the problems of a socialist economy could be solved by a central planning agency. The central agency would have the necessary statistics on the economy, as well as the capability of using statistics to direct production. The economy could be represented as a system of equations. Solution values for these equations could be used to price all goods at marginal cost and direct production. Hayek (1935) argued against the proposal to simulate markets with equations. Dickinson (1939) adopted the Lange-Taylor proposal to simulate markets through trial and error.

The Lange-Dickinson version of market socialism kept capital investment out of the market. Lange (1926 p65) insisted that a central planning board would have to set capital accumulation rates arbitrarily. Lange and Dickinson saw potential problems with bureaucratization in market socialism. According to Dickinson &quot;the attempt to check irresponsibility will tie up managers of socialist enterprises with so much red tape and bureaucratic regulation that they will lose all initiative and independence&quot; Dickinson 1938 p214). In the Economics of Control (1944) Abba Lerner admitted that capital investment would be politicized in market socialism.

More contemporary models include &quot;Coupon Socialism&quot; (by the economist [[John Roemer]]) and &quot;[[Economic Democracy#Market_models|Economic Democracy]]&quot; (by the philosopher [[David Schweickart]]).

Bardham and Roemer suggested a form of Market Socialism where there was a &quot;stock market&quot; that distributed capital fairly between the workers. In this stock market, there is no buying or selling of stocks, which leads to negative externalities associated with a concentration of capital ownership. The Bardham and Roemer model satisfied the main requirements of both Socialism (workers own all the factors of production{{spaced ndash}}not just labour) and market economies (prices determine efficient allocation of resources). A New Zealand Economist, Steven O'Donnell, expanded on the Bardham and Roemer model and decomposed the capital function in a general equilibrium system to take account of entrepreneurial activity in market socialist economies. O'Donnell (2003) set up a model that could be used as a blueprint for transition economies, and the results suggested that although market socialist models were inherently unstable in the long term, in the short term they would provide the economic infrastructure necessary for a successful transition from Socialist to market economy.

Yugoslav economists [[Jaroslav Vanek]] and [[Branko Horvat]] promoted a model of market socialism dubbed the ''Illyrian model'', where firms were socially-owned by their employees and based on worker's self-management, competing in open and free markets.

===Anti-Equilibrium economics===
Another form of market socialism was promoted by critics of [[central planning]] and [[general equilibrium theory]], the most notable economists being [[Alec Nove]] and [[Janos Kornai]]. In particular, Alec Nove's ''feasible socialism'' proposed a mixed economy consisting of state-run enterprises, autonomous publicly-owned firms, cooperatives, and small-scale private enterprise operating in an economy consisting of both markets and indirect macroeconomic planning.&lt;ref&gt;Feasible Socialism: Market or Plan – Or Both: http://www.whatnextjournal.co.uk/Pages/Ratner/Feassoc.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical basis==
The key theoretical basis for market socialism is the negation of the underlying expropriation of surplus value present in other, exploitative, modes of production. Socialist theories that favored the market date back to the [[Ricardian socialism|Ricardian socialists]], who advocated a free-market combined with state ownership of the means of production.

An important base for the first definition of market socialism in [[economic theory]] is the [[Lange Model]], which states that an economy in which all production is performed by the state, but in which there is a functioning price mechanism, has similar properties to a market economy under [[perfect competition]], in that it achieves [[Pareto efficiency]].

==Implementation==
[[Peter Drucker]] described the U.S. system of regulated pension funds providing capital to financial markets as &quot;pension fund socialism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''The unseen revolution: how pension fund socialism came to America'', Peter Ferdinand Drucker, Harper Collins, 1976, ISBN 978-0-06-011097-0&lt;/ref&gt;  [[William H. Simon]] characterized pension fund socialism as &quot;a form of market socialism&quot;, concluding that it was promising but perhaps with prospects more limited than those envisioned by its enthusiasts.&lt;ref&gt;William H. Simon, &quot;Prospects for Pension Fund Socialism&quot;, ''Corporate control and accountability: changing structures and the dynamics'' J McCahery, et al., Oxford University Press, 1995, ISBN [http://books.google.com/books?id=RPo4_dUeHAAC&amp;pg=PA167&amp;dq=pension.fund.socialism.is.a.form.of.market.socialism&amp;ei=r5KPSs3wGpPOlQSSwv27Bw#v=onepage&amp;q=pension.fund.socialism.is.a.form.of.market.socialism&amp;f=false p.167]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses of the term==
{{Marxism–Leninism sidebar}}
Although the name is similar, it markedly differs from the [[socialist market economy]] and [[Socialist-oriented market economy]], which is practiced within the [[People's Republic of China]] and [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]], respectively. 

Market socialism has also been used as a name for any attempt by a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-style economy to introduce market elements into its economic system. In this sense, &quot;market socialism&quot; was first attempted during the 1920s in the Soviet Union as the [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP), but soon abandoned. Later, elements of &quot;market socialism&quot; were introduced in [[Hungary]] (where it was nicknamed &quot;[[goulash communism]]&quot;), [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Yugoslavia]] (see [[Titoism]]) in the 1970s and 1980s. The [[Economy of Belarus]] has been described as a &quot;market socialist&quot; system. Modern [[Vietnam]] and [[Laos]] also describe themselves as market socialist systems. The [[Soviet Union]] attempted to introduce a market socialist system with its [[perestroika]] reforms under [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. During the later stages there was talk within top circles that the government should create the Socialist Market Economy; however, they never reached an agreement of how much socialism and market was to be featured.

Historically, these kinds of &quot;market socialist&quot; systems attempt to retain state ownership of the ''commanding heights of the economy'', such as heavy industry, energy, and infrastructure, while introducing decentralised decision making and giving local managers more freedom to make decisions and respond to market demands. Market socialist systems also allow private ownership and [[entrepreneur]]ship in the service and other secondary economic sectors. The [[market]] is allowed to determine prices for consumer goods and agricultural products, and farmers are allowed to sell all or some of their products on the open market and keep some or all of the profit as an incentive to increase and improve production.

===Socialist market economy===
The Chinese experience with [[socialism with Chinese characteristics]] is frequently referred to as a &quot;[[socialist market economy]]&quot; in which the &quot;commanding heights&quot; remain in state ownership, but a substantial portion of both the state and private sectors of economy are governed by free market practices, including a stock exchange for trading equity. The free-market is the arbitrator for most economic activity, with economic planning being relegated to macro-economic government indicative planning that does not encompass the microeconomic decision-making that is left to the individual organizations and state-owned enterprises. This model includes a significant amount of privately owned firms that operate as a business for profit, but only for consumer goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adb.org/Documents/Events/2004/PRC_Planning_System_Reform/chow1.pdf &quot;The Role of Planning in China's Market Economy&quot;], presented before the &quot;International Conference on China's Planning System Reform&quot;, March 24 and 25, 2004 in Beijing, by Prof. Gregory C. Chow, Princeton University.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Directive centralized planning composed of mandatory output requirements and production quotas have been displaced by the free-market mechanism (for most of the economy) and directive planning in larger state industries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adb.org/Documents/Events/2004/PRC_Planning_System_Reform/chow1.pdf &quot;The Role of Planning in China's Market Economy&quot;], presented before the &quot;International Conference on China's Planning System Reform&quot;, March 24 and 25, 2004 in Beijing, by Prof. Gregory C. Chow, Princeton University.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the major changes between the old [[planned economy]] and the socialist market model is the [[corporatization]] state institutions, with 150 of them reporting directly to the central government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.forbes.com/2008/07/08/china-enterprises-state-lead-cx_jrw_0708mckinsey.html | work=Forbes | title=Reassessing China's State-Owned Enterprises | date=July 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2008, these state-owned corporations have became increasingly dynamic and generated lots of revenue for the state,&lt;ref&gt;http://us.ft.com/ftgateway/superpage.ft?news_id=fto031620081407384075&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David A.

The [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]] pursued market-oriented reforms in 1986, resulting in what is officially called a &quot;[[Socialist-oriented market economy]]&quot;, a system that utilizes market forces to distribute consumer goods produced by state-run, collectively owned and privately owned enterprises.

Proponents of socialist market economic systems argue from a Marxist perspective, stating that a planned socialist economy can only be brought about by first establishing a comprehensive commodity market economy and letting it fully develop until it exhausts its historical stage and gradually transforms itself into a planned economy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.google.com/gview?a=v&amp;q=cache:tWl8XGM_vQAJ:www.nodo50.org/cubasigloXXI/congreso06/conf3_zhonquiao.pdf+Socialist+planned+commodity+economy&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us ''Market Economy and Socialist Road''], Duan Zhongqiao&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that the economic system of the USSR and its satellite states attempted to go from a natural economy to a planned economy by decree, without passing through the necessary market economy phase of development. Proponents of socialist-directed market economies distinguish themselves from market socialists, and state that market socialists believe that only through utilizing the market mechanism can socialism be achieved, and that planned economies are ineffective or undesirable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.google.com/gview?a=v&amp;q=cache:tWl8XGM_vQAJ:www.nodo50.org/cubasigloXXI/congreso06/conf3_zhonquiao.pdf+Socialist+planned+commodity+economy&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us ''Market Economy and Socialist Road''], Duan Zhongqiao&lt;/ref&gt;
