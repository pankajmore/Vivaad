'''Center for Science in the Public Interest''' ('''CSPI''') is a [[Washington, D.C.]]-based [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]] [[watchdog journalism|watchdog]] and [[consumer advocacy]] [[Advocacy group|group]] focusing on nutritional education and awareness.

==History and funding==
[[File:Universal North Building.JPG|thumb|CSPI headquarters in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
CSPI is a consumer advocacy organization. Its focus is nutrition and health, food safety, and alcohol policy. CSPI is headed by [[Michael F. Jacobson]], who founded the group in 1971 along with James Sullivan and Albert Fritsch, two fellow scientists from [[Ralph Nader]]'s Center for the Study of Responsive Law. In the early days, CSPI focused on various aspects such as nutrition, environmental issues, and nuclear energy. However, after the 1977 departure of Fritsch and Sullivan, CSPI began to focus exclusively on nutrition and food safety.&lt;ref&gt;James Bennett &amp; Thomas DiLorenzo, ''[http://www.heartland.org/healthpolicy-news.org/article/9271/Food_and_Drink_Police.html Food and Drink Police: Center for Science in the Public Interest wants government to control our eating habits]'', (Health Care News, May 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; 

CSPI has [[501(c)|501(c)(3)]] status. Its chief source of income is its ''Nutrition Action Health Letter'', which has about 900,000 subscribers and does not accept corporate advertising.&lt;ref name=NAHletter&gt;

== Programs and campaigns ==

===Nutrition and food labeling===
CSPI has advocated more accurately defined nutrition and food labeling.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
 |author=Masterson, K
 |title=Food cop: Love him or hate him
 |journal=Chicago Tribune
 |date=2007-10-14
}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, labeling of &quot;low-fat&quot; or &quot;heart healthy&quot; foods in restaurants must now meet specific requirements established by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] as of May 2, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;

|publisher=FDA Consumer magazine (May–June 1997)
|date=1997-07
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, the group first brought the issue of high saturated fat in movie [[popcorn]] to the public attention. In 2003, it worked with lawyer [[John F. Banzhaf III]] to pressure [[ice cream]] retailers to display nutritional information about their products. Most recently, CSPI has focused on nutrition labeling at [[Chain store#Restaurant chains|chain restaurants]] and has helped introduce menu labeling legislation in several U.S. cities and [[U.S. state|states]]. Its guidelines include detailed nutrition labeling, a prohibition on [[trans fat]]s additives, and reducing the amount of [[sodium]] in [[Food processing|processed foods]].  

In 1989, CSPI was instrumental in convincing fast-food restaurants to stop using animal fat for frying, promoting the use of trans fats instead. They would later reverse their position on the use of trans fats.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the Center published a report entitled ''[[Liquid Candy|Liquid Candy: How Soft Drinks are Harming Americans' Health]]''. It examined statistics relating to the soaring consumption of soft drinks, particularly by children, and the consequent health ramifications including tooth decay, nutritional depletion, obesity, type-2 (formerly known as &quot;adult-onset&quot;) diabetes, and heart disease. It also reviewed soft drink marketing and made various recommendations aimed at reducing soft drink consumption, in schools and elsewhere. A second, updated edition of the report was published in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Michael F Jacobson PhD, ''[http://www.cspinet.org/new/pdf/liquid_candy_final_w_new_supplement.pdf Liquid Candy: How Soft Drinks are Harming Americans' Health]'', (CSPI, Washington DC 1998; 2nd Ed. 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the actions they advocate [[soda tax|taxing soft drinks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cspinet.org/new/200909301.html|title=Taxing Soda Could Trim State Deficits (and Waistlines), Says Report|date=2010-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food Safety Initiative===
One of CSPI's largest projects is its Food Safety initiative, directed to reduce [[food contamination]] and [[foodborne illness]].  In addition to publishing ''Outbreak Alert!'', a compilation of food-borne illnesses and outbreaks, the project supports the establishment of a new Food Safety Administration that would combine the food safety functions of the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), and [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) into a single agency.

===Alcohol Policies Project ===
The group's &quot;Alcohol Policies Project&quot; advocates against what it considers adverse societal influences of alcohol, such as marketing campaigns that target young drinkers,&lt;ref&gt;Nat Ives. [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D04E4D6153FF935A35750C0A9659C8B63 &quot;The media business: Advertising; a trade group tries to wean the alcohol industry from full-figured twins and other racy images&quot;]. ''New York Times''. March 6, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and promotes turning self-imposed advertising bans by alcohol industry groups into law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DEFDB163BF93BA35752C1A960958260 &quot;Alcohol industry ends its ad ban in broadcasting&quot;], ''New York Times''. November 8, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;  The project is run by long-time director [[George Hacker]], a lawyer who also co-directs the [[Coalition for the Prevention of Alcohol Problems]].

One of the main activities of the project is the &quot;Campaign for Alcohol-Free Sports TV&quot;. Launched in 2003 with support of at least 80 other local and national groups, the campaign asked schools to pledge to prohibit [[alcohol advertising]] on local sports programming and to work toward eliminating alcohol advertising from televised college sports programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-11-16-colleges-alcohol_x.htm &quot;Colleges are reaching their limit on alcohol&quot;]. ''USAToday''. November 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  It also sought Congressional support for such a prohibition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/09/sports/ncaabasketball/09college.html &quot;Bill would ask N.C.A.A. to forgo alcohol ads&quot;]. ''New York Times''. March 9, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, CSPI has pressured alcoholic beverage companies with lawsuits. In one such lawsuit, filed in September 2008, the Center &quot;sue[d] [[MillerCoors|MillerCoors Brewing Company]] over its malt beverage [[Sparks (drink)|Sparks]], arguing that the [[caffeine]] and [[guarana]] in the drink are additives that have not been approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]],&quot; and that the combination of those ingredients with alcohol resulted in &quot;more [[drunk driving]], more injuries, and more [[sexual assault]]s.&quot;&lt;ref name=Reason&gt;[[Jacob Sullum|Sullum, Jacob]] (2011-02-16) [http://reason.com/archives/2011/02/15/loco-over-four-loko/singlepage Loco over Four Loko], ''[[Reason magazine|Reason]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
CSPI's public policy recommendations, and sometimes the organization's motivation for making them, have been challenged by various parties, particularly those within the food industry that have been the most directly affected.

=== Of past advocacy ===
One example surrounds the organization's reversal of position on the question of [[trans fat]]s during the 1980 and 1990s.  During the 1980s, CSPI's campaign &quot;Saturated Fat Attack&quot; advocated the replacement of beef tallow, palm oil and coconut oil at fast food restaurants,&lt;ref name=&quot;perfectsolution&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://columbia.academia.edu/DavidSchleifer/Papers/1478327/The_Perfect_Solution_How_Trans_Fats_Became_the_Healthy_Replacement_for_Saturated_Fats | title=The Perfect Solution: How Trans Fats Became the Healthy Replacement for Saturated Fats | author=David Schleifer | publisher=Columbia University | year=2012 | accessdate=September 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while maintaining that trans fat were comparatively benign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | accessdate=2008-10-10 | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0813/is_n2_v15/ai_6482599 | work=Nutrition Action Healthletter, published by CSPI | title=The truth about trans: hydrogenated oils aren't guilty as charged | author=Blume, Elaine | date=March 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1986 pamphlet entitled &quot;The Fast-Food Guide&quot;, it praised chains such as KFC that had converted to partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, which are lower in saturated fat but high in trans fat. As a result of this pressure, many restaurants such as McDonald's made the switch.&lt;ref name=&quot;perfectsolution&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | accessdate=2008-10-10 | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2002/09/04/MN96492.DTL | title=McDonald's Oil Change |work=San Francisco Chronicle | date=2002-09-04 | author=Severson, Kim}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the mid-1990s onward, however, CSPI identified trans fats as the greater public health danger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Trans+in+trouble.-a09099690 | title=Trans in trouble | author=Liebman, Bonnie | publisher=Nutrition Action Healthletter | date=October 1, 1990 | accessdate=September 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; CSPI executive director Michael Jacobson went on record saying, &quot;Twenty years ago, scientists (including me) thought trans [fat] was innocuous. Since then, we've learned otherwise.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;perfectsolution&quot;/&gt; 

In response, three trade groups &amp;mdash; the [[National Restaurant Association]], the National Association of Margarine Manufacturers and the Institute of Shortening and Edible Oils &amp;mdash; &quot;said the evidence was contradictory and inconclusive, and accused CSPI of jumping to a premature conclusion.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | accessdate=2008-10-08 | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E02E0D7143EF93BA3575BC0A960958260 | work=New York Times | title=Debate Flares on Fat From Hydrogenated Oils | date=1996-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Numerous studies and public health agencies have since supported the view that trans fats carry health risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Trans fat: Avoid this cholesterol double whammy | publisher = Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER) | url = http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/trans-fat/CL00032 | accessdate = 10-1-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Mozaffarian D, Katan MB, Ascherio A, Stampfer MJ, Willett WC|title= Trans Fatty Acids and Cardiovascular Disease|date=13 April 2006|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=354|issue=15|pages=1601–1613|url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/354/15/1601|doi= 10.1056/NEJMra054035| pmid = 16611951 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Trans Fat Task Force | title = TRANSforming the Food Supply (Appendix 9iii)| month = June | year = 2006 | url = http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/nutrition/gras-trans-fats/tf-ge/tf-gt_app9iii_e.html | accessdate = 10-01-09 }} (See Question #5.)&lt;/ref&gt;) A ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' editorial acknowledged the risks, but argued, based on its reversal, that CSPI itself was to blame for creating the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | accessdate=2008-10-10 | url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/weekend/hottopic/?id=110009366 | work=Wall Street Journal | title=The Bloomberg Diet: The nanny state reaches into the kitchen | date=2006-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Of policies ===
Other critics — such as the restaurant, food, and tobacco industry-funded [[Center for Consumer Freedom]]— refer to CSPI as &quot;the Food Police,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes_FoodPolice&quot;&gt;{{cite web | accessdate=2008-10-08 | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/12/business/yourmoney/12food.html | work=New York Times | author=Warner, Melanie | title=Striking Back at the Food Police | date=2005-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WATimes_Ruse&quot;&gt;{{cite web | accessdate=2008-10-08 | url=http://www.washtimes.com/news/2006/sep/17/20060917-094117-3953r/ | work=Washington Times | author=Barr, Bob | title=Scientific Research Ruse | date=2006-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and suggest its focus on food manufacturers and retailers distracts from &quot;real culprits... a lack of exercise and people's unwillingness to take personal responsibility for their own diets.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes_FoodPolice&quot;/&gt; Former [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Bob Barr]] (a libertarian-leaning Republican) accused CSPI of pursuing &quot;a pre-existing political agenda&quot; and pointed to individual responsibility for dietary choices.&lt;ref name=&quot;WATimes_Ruse&quot;/&gt; [[Cato Institute]] (a Washington D.C.-based libertarian think tank) scholar [[Walter Olson]] wrote that the group's &quot;longtime [[shtick]] is to complain that businesses like [[McDonald’s]], rather than our own choices, are to blame for rising obesity,&quot; and called CSPI's suit against [[McDonald's]] on behalf of a [[California]] mother a &quot;new low in responsible parenting&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Olson|Olson, Walter]] (2010-12-15) [http://www.nydailynews.com/opinions/2010/12/15/2010-12-15_mcdonalds_suit_over_happy_meal_toys_by_california_mom_monet_parham_new_low_in_re.html McDonald's suit over Happy Meal toys by California mom Monet Parham new low in responsible parenting], ''[[New York Daily News]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, food industry [[lobbyist]] [[Richard Berman|Rick Berman]], who is also the [[executive director]] of the Center for Consumer Freedom,&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes_FoodPolice&quot;/&gt; announced a series of print and radio ads designed in part to drive traffic to the CCF [[website]]. A ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' article identified CSPI as &quot;one of two groups singled out [by the CCF] for full-on attack,&quot; and said, &quot;What's not mentioned on the [CCF] Web site is that it's one of [[Center for Consumer Freedom#Activism_websites|a cluster of such nonprofits]] started... by Berman.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/a/2002/05/11/MN119037.DTL | title=Hand that feeds bites back: Food industry forks over ad campaign to win hearts, stomachs | work=San Francisco Chronicle | author=Ness, Carol | date=2002-05-11 | accessdate=2008-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Of science ===
Criticism has even come, on occasion, from CSPI alumni. For instance, Doug Gurian-Sherman (former science director for CSPI's biotechnology project, now a member of the [[Union of Concerned Scientists]]) responded to a 2005 position paper on the regulation of genetically engineered crops by saying, &quot;CSPI’s assumption that these crops should take less time is inconsistent with its own positions and clearly misunderstands the science involved.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lobbywatch.org/archive2.asp?arcid=4867 | title=CSPI &quot;simply wrong on the science&quot; says its former science director | work=lobbywatch.org | author=lobbywatch.org | date=2005-03-02 | accessdate=2011-5-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
