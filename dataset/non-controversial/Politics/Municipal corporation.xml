      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8486">A '''municipal corporation''' is the legal term for a [[local government|local governing body]], including (but not necessarily limited to) [[city|cities]], [[county|counties]], [[town]]s, [[township]]s, [[charter township]]s, [[village]]s, and [[borough]]s. '''Municipal incorporation''' occurs when such [[municipality|municipalities]] become self-governing entities under the laws of the state or province in which they are located. Often, this event is marked by the award or declaration of a [[municipal charter]].

With the notable exception of the [[City of London Corporation]], the term has fallen out of favour in the [[United Kingdom]], but the concept remains central to [[local government in the United Kingdom]], as well as former [[British colonies]] such as [[India]] and Canada.

==Municipal charters==
A '''city charter''' or '''town charter''' (generically, '''municipal charter''') is a legal [[document]] establishing a [[municipality]] such as a [[city]] or [[town]].  The concept developed in [[Europe]] during the [[middle ages]]. It's considered to be a municipal version of a [[constitution]]. 

Traditionally the granting of a charter gave a settlement and its inhabitants the right to [[town privileges]] under the feudal system.  Townspeople who lived in chartered towns were [[Bourgeoisie|burghers]], as opposed to [[serfs]] who lived in villages.  Towns were often &quot;free&quot;, in the sense that they were [[Imperial immediacy|directly protected by the king or emperor]], and were not part of a feudal [[Fiefdom|fief]].

Today the process for granting charters is determined by the type of government of the state in question.  In monarchies, charters are still often a [[royal charter]] given by [[the Crown]] or the state authorities acting on behalf of the Crown.  In federations, the granting of charters may be within the jurisdiction of the lower level of government such as a [[State (administrative division)|state]] or [[province]].

==By country==
===Brazil===
In Brazil, municipal corporations are called ''municípios'' and are created by means of local legislation at state level, or after passing a [[referendum]] vote of the affected population. All municipal corporations must also abide by an Organic Municipal Law which is passed and amended (when needed) at municipal level.

===Canada===
{{Main|Local government in Canada}}
In Canada charters are granted by [[provinces and territories of Canada|provincial authorities]].

===Germany===
In [[Germany]], municipal corporations existed since antiquity and through [[medieval]] times, until they became out of favour during the absolutism. In order to strengthen the public spirit the city law of Prussia dated 19 November 1808 picked up this concept. It is the basis of today's municipal law.

===India===
{{Main article|Municipal Corporations in India}}
[[File:Municipal building bangalore.jpg|thumb|Municipal building in [[Bangalore]]]]
In [[India]] a Municipal Corporation is a local government body that administers a city of population 200,000 or more. Under the [[panchayati raj]] system, it interacts directly with the state government, though it is administratively part of the district it is located in. The largest Municipal Corporations in India currently are [[Mumbai]], followed by [[Delhi]], [[Kolkata]],  [[Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike|Bangalore]], [[Chennai]], [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], [[Ahmedabad]], [[Surat]] and [[Pune]]. The [[Corporation of Chennai]] is the oldest Municipal Corporation in the world outside UK.&lt;ref name=&quot;oldestcorp&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/mp/2003/04/02/stories/2003040200100300.htm|title=The first corporation |date=2003-04-02|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|language=English|accessdate=14 April 2012|location=Chennai}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Municipal Corporation consists of members elected from the [[Ward (country subdivision)|wards]] of the city. The [[Mayor]] and Deputy Mayor are elected by the members among themselves. A [[Municipal Commissioner]], who is from the [[Indian Administrative Service]] is appointed to head the administrative staff of the Municipal Corporation, implement the decisions of the Corporation and prepare its annual budget.

The Municipal Corporation is responsible for roads, public transportation, water supply, records of births and deaths (delegated from central government Births and Deaths Registration Act), sanitation that includes waste management, sewage, drainage and flood control, public safety services like fire and ambulance services, gardens and maintenance of buildings. The sources of income of the Corporation are property tax, entertainment tax, [[octroi]] (now abolished from many cities) and usage fees for utilities.

===Republic of Ireland===
{{Main|City status in Ireland}}

In Ireland, municipal corporations existed in [[boroughs]] since [[medieval]] times. The [[Dublin Corporation|Corporation of Dublin]], officially styled ''the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Burgesses of the City of Dublin'' had existed since the 13th century. Corporations were established under the [[royal charter]] establishing the city or borough. The [[Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840]] abolished all but ten of the boroughs and their corporations. The [[Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898]] created two different types of borough, [[county boroughs]] had essentially equal status to counties - these comprised [[Dublin]], [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[Limerick]], and [[Waterford]] (as well as [[Belfast]] and [[Derry]], which are now in [[Northern Ireland]]). The other boroughs were non-county boroughs.

The [[Local Government Act 2001]] abolished the title of municipal corporation. Corporations of county boroughs (renamed [[City status in Ireland|cities]]) were renamed City Councils. Non county boroughs were abolished, but those towns which were previously non-county boroughs were allowed to use the title of Borough Council. Royal charters remain in force for ceremonial and civic purposes only.

===South Africa===
The municipality of [[Durban]] was called the Durban Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fad.co.za/Resources/transport/transport.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
In [[Sweden]] until 1951, cities were established by [[royal charter]]; see [[City status in Sweden]].

===Philippines===
{{Main|Cities of the Philippines}}
From the beginning of American colonial rule, Philippines cities were formally established through laws enacted by the various national legislatures in the country. The [[Philippine Commission]] gave the city of Manila its charter in 1901, while the city of Baguio was established by the [[Philippine Assembly]] which was composed by elected members instead of appointed ones. During the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Commonwealth era]], the [[National Assembly of the Philippines|National Assembly]] established an additional ten cities. Since achieving independence from the United States in 1946 the [[Congress of the Philippines|Philippine Congress]] has established 124 more cities (as of September 2007), the majority of which required the holding of a [[plebiscite]] within the proposed city's jurisdiction to ratify the city's charter.

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]], cities are granted that status by Royal [[letters patent]]: see [[city status in the United Kingdom]].

===United States===
{{main|Local government in the United States}}
In the [[United States]], such municipal corporations are established by charters that are granted either directly by a [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]] by means of [[local legislation]], or indirectly under a general municipal corporation [[law]], usually after the proposed charter has passed a [[referendum]] vote of the affected population.
