'''Annexation''' ([[Latin]] ''ad'', to, and ''nexus'', joining) is the permanent acquisition and incorporation of some territory into another geo-political entity (either adjacent or non-contiguous).&lt;ref&gt;David M. Edelstein. Occupational Hazards: Why Military Occupations Succeed or Fail
''International Security'', Vol. 29, No. 1 (Summer, 2004), pp. 49-91&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, it is implied that the territory and population being ''annexed'' is the smaller, more peripheral, and weaker of the two merging entities, barring physical size. It can also imply a certain measure of coercion, [[expansionism]] or [[unilateralism]] on the part of the stronger of the merging entities. Because of this, more positive terms like [[political union]] or [[reunification]] are sometimes preferred. Annexation differs from [[cession]] and [[Amalgamation (politics)|amalgamation]], because unlike cession where territory is given or sold through treaty, or amalgamation (where the authorities of both sides are asked if they agree with the merge), annexation is a unilateral act where territory is seized and held by one state and legitimized via general recognition by the other international bodies (i.e. countries and intergovernmental organisations).&lt;ref name=EB-Annexation&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/ebi/article-9007693 Annexation], [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
During World War II the use of annexation deprived whole populations of the safeguards provided by [[international law]]s governing [[military occupation]]s. The authors of the Geneva Convention IV made a point of &quot;giving these rules an absolute character&quot;, thus making it much more difficult for a state to bypass international law through the use of annexation.&lt;ref name=GCIV&gt;Convention (IV) relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War. Geneva, 12 August 1949.[http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/WebPrint/380-600054-COM?OpenDocument Commentary on Part III : Status and treatment of protected persons #Section III : Occupied territories Art. 47] by the [[International Committee of the Red Cross|ICRC]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==International law after 1948==
The [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] (GCIV) of 1949 amplified the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]] in respect to the question of the protection of civilians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/WebPrint/380-600054-COM?OpenDocument &quot;it was obvious that they were in fact always subservient to the will of the Occupying Power. Such practices were incompatible with the traditional concept of occupation (as defined in Article 43 of the Hague Regulations of 1907)&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;  GCIV also emphasised the [[United Nations Charter]]&lt;ref name= GCIV/&gt;: the [[United Nations Charter]] (June 26, 1945) had prohibited war of aggression (See articles 1.1, 2.3, 2.4) and GCIV [[Wikisource:Fourth Geneva Convention#Article 47|Article 47]], the first paragraph in Section III: Occupied territories, restricted the effects of annexation on the rights of persons within those territories:

{{quotation|Protected persons who are in occupied territory shall not be deprived, in any case or in any manner whatsoever, of the benefits of the present Convention by any change introduced, as the result of the occupation of a territory, into the institutions or government of the said territory, nor by any agreement concluded between the authorities of the occupied territories and the Occupying Power, nor by any annexation by the latter of the whole or part of the occupied territory.}}

[[Wikisource:Fourth Geneva Convention#Article 49|Article 49]] prohibits mass movement of people out of or into occupied territory:&lt;ref&gt;Convention (IV) relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War. Geneva, 12 August 1949.[http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/380-600056?OpenDocument Commentary on Part III : Status and treatment of protected persons #Section III : Occupied territories Art. 49] by the [[International Committee of the Red Cross|ICRC]]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|Individual or mass forcible transfers, as well as deportations of protected persons from occupied territory to the territory of the Occupying Power or to that of any other country, occupied or not, are prohibited, regardless of their motive. ... The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.}}

[[Protocol I]] (1977): &quot;Protocol Additional to the [[Geneva Conventions]] of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts&quot; has additional articles which cover military occupation, but many countries including the United States are not signatory to this additional protocol.

==Examples since 1948==

===Portuguese India===
{{main|1961 Indian annexation of Goa}}
In 1954, the residents of [[Dadra and Nagar Haveli]], a Portuguese [[enclave]] within India, ended Portuguese rule with the help of nationalist volunteers. From 1954 to 1961, the territory enjoyed ''de facto'' independence. In 1961, the territory was merged with India after its government signed an agreement with the Indian government. 

In 1961, [[India]] and [[Portugal]] engaged in a brief military conflict over [[Goa]] and [[Daman and Diu]], Portuguese [[enclave]]s within India. India invaded and conquered the areas after 36 hours of fighting, ending 451 years of Portuguese colonial rule in India. The action was seen in India as a liberation of historically Indian territory. In Portugal however, the loss of Goa and the Daman and Diu was seen as a national tragedy. Goa and Daman and Diu were incorporated into India.

===Sikkim===
In 1947, a popular vote rejected [[Sikkim]]'s joining the Indian Union and the prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, agreed to a special protectorate status for Sikkim. Sikkim came under the suzerainty of India, which controlled its external affairs, defence, diplomacy and communications, but Sikkim otherwise retained autonomy. A state council was established in 1955 to allow for constitutional government under the [[Chogyal]]. Meanwhile trouble was brewing in the state after the Sikkim National Congress demanded fresh elections and greater representation for the Nepalese. In 1973, riots in front of the palace led to a formal request for protection from India. The Chogyal was proving to be extremely unpopular with the people. In 1975, the Kazi (Prime Minister) appealed to the Indian Parliament for a change in Sikkim's status so that it could become a state of India. In April, the Indian Army moved into Sikkim, seizing the city of Gangtok and disarming the Palace Guards. A referendum was held in which 97.5% of the voting people (59% of the people entitled to vote) voted to join the Indian Union. A few weeks later, on May 16, 1975, Sikkim officially became the 22nd state of the Indian Union and the monarchy was abolished.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Information and Public Relations, Government of Sikkim. 2005-09-29. http://www.sikkimipr.org/GENERAL/HISTORY/history_of_sikkim.htm. Retrieved on 2006-10-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ogaden===
In 1954, former British [[Ogaden]] (a [[Somali Region]]) was annexed by [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]]. Somali nationalists have waged wars of liberation since 1954. Currently, the [[Ogaden National Liberation Front]] (ONLF) leads this nationalist effort and is engaged in a fierce military confrontation with [[Ethiopia]], the new name of Abyssinia.

===Rockall===
On 18 September 1955 at precisely 10:16 am, in what would be the final territorial expansion of the [[British Empire]], [[Rockall]] was declared officially annexed by the British Crown when [[Lieutenant-Commander]] Desmond Scott [[Royal Navy|RN]], [[Sergeant]] Brian Peel [[Royal Marines|RM]], [[Corporal]] AA Fraser RM, and James Fisher (a civilian [[natural history|naturalist]] and former Royal Marine), were deposited on the island by a [[Royal Navy helicopter]] from {{HMS|Vidal}} (coincidentally named after the man who first charted the island). The team cemented in a brass plaque on Hall's Ledge and hoisted the [[Union Flag]] to stake the UK's claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=BBC staff |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/21/newsid_4582000/4582327.stm |title=On this day: 21 September 1955: Britain claims Rockall |publisher=BBC|accessdate=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However this annexation is not recognised by Denmark (for the [[Faroe Islands]]), the [[Republic of Ireland]] or [[Iceland]].

===East Timor===
Following an Indonesian invasion in 1975, [[East Timor]] was annexed by Indonesia and was known as Timor Timur. It was regarded by Indonesia as the country's 27th province, but this was never recognised by the [[United Nations]]. The people of East Timor was divided between resisted Indonesian forces in a prolonged guerilla campaign and accepted the process of integration. (See: [[History of East Timor#Indonesian rule|Indonesian rule in East Timor]]).

Following a [[East Timorese independence referendum, 1999|referendum]] held in 1999, under a [[UN]] sponsored agreement between [[Indonesia]] and the people of East Timor, 78.5% of voters rejected the offer of autonomy within Indonesia. East Timor achieved independence in 2002 and is now officially known as [[East Timor|Timor-Leste]].

===Western Sahara===
In 1975, and following the [[Madrid Accords]] (illegal according to international laws) between [[Morocco]], [[Mauritania]] and Spain, the latter withdrew from the territory and ceded the administration to Morocco and Mauritania. This was challenged by a [[national liberation movement]], the [[Polisario Front]], that waged a [[guerilla war]] against both Morocco and Mauritania. In 1979, and after a military [[putsch]], Mauritania withdrew from the territory which left it occupied by Morocco. A [[United Nations]] peace process was initiated in 1991, but it has been stalled, and as of mid-2010, the UN is holding direct negotiations between Morocco and the Polisario Front to reach a solution to the conflict.

===West Bank===
The part of former [[Mandatory Palestine]] occupied by the Jordanian Army during the [[Israeli War of Independence]], which some Israelis call &quot;[[Judea and Samaria]]&quot;, was renamed &quot;the [[West Bank]]&quot;. It was annexed to Jordan in 1950 at the request of a Palestinian delegation.&lt;ref name=jordan_annexation&gt;[http://www.jcpa.org.il/art/knesset6.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; It had been questioned, however, how representative that delegation was, and at the insistence of the [[Arab League]] Jordan was considered a trustee only.&lt;ref name=Jordan_trustee&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Peace/legsess.html Arab League Session: 12-II Date: May 1950]&lt;/ref&gt; Although only the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Pakistan]] recognized annexation by Jordan, the British did not consider it Sovereign to Jordan
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Jerusalem: a city and its future | publisher=Syracuse University Press | author=Marshall J. Berger, Ora Ahimeir | year=2002 | location=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=FGOY5oDGGLUC&amp;pg=PA145 | pages=145 | isbn=978-0-8156-2912-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not condemned by the UNSC and it  remained under Jordanian rule until 1967 when it was occupied, though not annexed ('INITIALLY' or 'OFFICIALLY'), by Israel. Jordan did not officially relinquish its claim to rule the West Bank until 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=A Historical Atlas of Jordan | publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group | author=Amy Romano | year=2003 | location=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=lGEkKBs9UT4C&amp;pg=PA51 | pages=51 | isbn=978-0-8239-3980-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel has not taken the step of annexing the territory, as that might have entailed giving the vote to its Palestinian inhabitants; rather, there were enacted a complex (and highly controversial) system of military government decrees in effect applying Israeli law in many spheres to [[Israeli settlements]] and to them alone.

===East Jerusalem===
During the 1967 [[Six Day War]], [[Israel]] captured the [[East Jerusalem]], then a part of the [[West Bank]], from [[Jordan]]. On June 27, 1967, Israel extended its law and jurisdiction to East Jerusalem and some of the surrounding area, incorporating about 70 square kilometers of territory  into the Jerusalem Municipality. Although at the time Israel informed the [[United Nations]] that its measures constituted administrative and municipal integration rather than annexation, later rulings by the Israeli Supreme Court indicated that East Jerusalem had become part of Israel. In 1980, Israel passed the [[Jerusalem Law]] as part of its [[Basic Laws of Israel|Basic Law]], which declared Jerusalem the &quot;complete and united&quot; capital of Israel. In other words, Israel purported to annex East Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;[[Avraham Sela|Sela, Avraham]].  &quot;Jerusalem.&quot; ''The Continuum Political Encyclopedia of the Middle East''.  Ed. Avraham Sela.  New York: Continuum, 2002.  pp. 391-498.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank, Mitch.  ''Understanding the Holy Land: Answering Questions about the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict''.  New York: Viking, 2005.  p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/1ce874ab1832a53e852570bb006dfaf6/07306ec80797cb170525654d00729005 &quot;A/35/508-S/14207 of 8 October 1980.&quot;] ''[[UNISPAL|UNISPAL - United Nations Information System on the Question of Palestine]]''.  8 October 1980.  8 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The annexation was declared null and void by UNSC Resolutions 252, 267, 271, 298, 465, 476 &lt;ref name=UNSC_res_476&gt;[http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/b86613e7d92097880525672e007227a7/6de6da8a650b4c3b852560df00663826?OpenDocument UNSC Resolutions referred to in UNSC res 476 - 252, 267, 271, 298, 465]&lt;/ref&gt; and  UNSC res 478&lt;ref name=UNSC_res_478&gt;[http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/DDE590C6FF232007852560DF0065FDDB UNSC res 478]&lt;/ref&gt;

Jewish neighborhoods have since been built in East Jerusalem, and Israeli Jews have since also settled in Arab neighborhoods there, though some Jews may have returned from their 1948 expulsion after the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1948)]].

No countries recognized Israel's annexation of East Jerusalem, except Costa Rica, and those who maintained embassies in Israel did not move them to Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Ian S. |last=Lustick |title=Has Israel Annexed East Jerusalem?| journal=Middle East Policy Council Journal|volume=5 |date=16 January 1997|number=1|doi=10.1111/j.1475-4967.1997.tb00247.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Not to be mistaken with International Law or Conventions, the [[United States Congress]] has passed the [[Jerusalem Embassy Act]], which recognizes Jerusalem as the united capital of Israel and instructs the government to relocate the U.S. embassy there, but the bill has been waived by Presidents [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]], [[George W. Bush|Bush]], and [[Barack Obama|Obama]] on national security grounds.

===Golan Heights===
Israel captured two-thirds of the [[Golan Heights]] from [[Syria]] during the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], and subsequently built Jewish settlements in the area. In 1981, Israel passed the [[Golan Heights Law]], which extended Israeli &quot;law, jurisdiction, and administration&quot; to the area, including the [[Shebaa farms]] area. This declaration was declared &quot;null and void and without international legal effect&quot; by [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 497]]. The only state that recognized the annexation is the [[Federated States of Micronesia]].

===Kuwait===
After being allied with [[Iraq]] during the [[Iran–Iraq War|Iran – Iraq War]] (largely due to desiring Iraqi protection from [[Iran]]), [[Kuwait]] was [[Invasion of Kuwait|invaded]] and declared annexed by Iraq (under [[Saddam Hussein]]) in August 1990. Hussein's primary justifications included a charge that Kuwaiti territory was in fact an Iraqi province, and that annexation was retaliation for &quot;economic warfare&quot; Kuwait had waged through [[slant drilling]] into Iraq's oil supplies. The monarchy was deposed after annexation, and an Iraqi governor installed.

United States President [[George H. W. Bush]] ultimately condemned Iraq's actions, and moved to drive out Iraqi forces. Authorized by the [[UN Security Council]], an American-led coalition of 34 nations fought the [[Gulf War]] to reinstate the Kuwaiti [[Emir]]. Iraq's invasion (and annexation) was deemed illegal and Kuwait remains an independent nation today.

==Subnational annexation==
{{see also|Municipal annexation in the United States}}
Within countries that are [[Country subdivision|subdivided]] noncontiguously, annexation can also take place whereby a lower-tier subdivision can annex territory under the jurisdiction of a higher-tier subdivision. An example of this is in the United States, where [[Municipality|incorporated]] cities and towns often expand their boundaries by annexing [[Unincorporated area|unincorporated]] land adjacent to them. Municipalities can also annex or be annexed by other municipalities, though this is less common in the United States. Laws governing the ability and the extent cities can expand in this fashion are defined by the individual [[U.S. state|states']] [[State constitution (United States)|constitutions]].

Annexation of neighbouring communities occurs in Canada, where the [[Unicity]] concept of city planning is popular. The city of Calgary, for example, has in the past annexed the communities of Bridgeland, Riverside, Sunnyside, Hillhurst, Hunter, Hubalta, Ogden, Forest Lawn, Midnapore, Shepard, Montgomery, and Bowness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucalgary.ca/cities/Places_and_People/Chapter%205%20-%20Annexation%20Policies%20and%20Urban%20Growth%20Management%20in%20Calgary.pdf &quot;Annexation Policies and Urban Growth Management in Calgary.&quot; Tim Creelman. Accessed December 17, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calgary.ca/DocGallery/BU/planning/pdf/annexation/history_annexation_map.pdf History of Annexation.] City of Calgary.
