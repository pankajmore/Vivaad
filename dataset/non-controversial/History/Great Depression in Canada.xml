'''[[History of Canada|Canada]]''' was hit hard by the '''[[Great Depression]]'''.  The worldwide [[Great Depression]] that started in the United States in late 1929 quickly reached Canada. Between 1929 and 1939, the gross national product dropped 40% (compared to 37% in the US).  Unemployment reached 27% at the depth of the Depression in 1933. Many businesses closed, as corporate profits of $398 million in 1929 turned into losses of $98 million as prices fell. Farmers in the Prairies were especially hard hit by the collapse of wheat prices.  Despite the emergence of numerous radical parties, the government was run by the major parties and no large-scale experiments, such as the American [[New Deal]] were attempted. The Depression ended in 1939 as World War II began.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Norrie and Douglas Owram, ''A History of the Canadian Economy'' (1991) ch 18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic results==
By 1933, 30% of the labour force was out of work, and one fifth of the population became dependent on government assistance. Wages fell, as did prices. [[Gross National Expenditure]] had declined 42% from the 1929 levels. In some areas, the decline was far worse. In the rural areas of the prairies, two thirds of the population were on relief.

Further damage was the reduction of investment: both large companies and individuals were unwilling and unable to invest in new ventures.

In 1932, industrial production was only at 58% of the 1929 level, the second lowest level in the world after the United States, and well behind nations such as Britain, which only saw it fall to 83% of the 1929 level. Total national income fell to 55% of the 1929 level, again worse than any nation other than the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=A. E. Safarian|title=The Canadian economy in the great depression|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=M5NMAAAAMAAJ|year=1970|publisher=McClelland and Stewart|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Impact===
[[File:ReliefWorkHighway.jpg|thumb|250px|Relief Work repairing a highway]]
Canada's economy at the time was just starting to shift from primary industry (farming, fishing, mining and logging) to manufacturing. Exports of [[raw material]]s plunged, and employment, prices and profits fell in every sector. Canada was the worst-hit  because of its economic position. It was further affected as its main trading partners were Britain and the U.S., both of which were badly affected by the worldwide depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=A. E. Safarian|title=The Canadian economy in the great depression|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=M5NMAAAAMAAJ|year=1970|publisher=McClelland and Stewart|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Unemployment===
Urban unemployment nationwide was 19%; Toronto's rate was 17%, according to the census of 1931. Farmers who stayed on their farms were not considered unemployed.&lt;ref&gt;Canada, Bureau of the Census, ''Unemployment'' Vol. VI (Ottawa 1931), 1,267&lt;/ref&gt; By 1933, 30% of the labour force was out of work, and one fifth of the population became dependent on government assistance. Wages fell as did prices. In some areas, such as mining and lumbering areas, the decline was far worse.  
===Prairie Provinces===
The Prairie Provinces and [[Western Canada]] were the hardest-hit. In the rural areas of the prairies, two thirds of the population were on relief. The region fully recovered after 1939. The fall of wheat prices drove many farmers to the towns and cities, such as [[Calgary, Alberta]]; [[Regina, Saskatchewan]]; and [[Brandon, Manitoba]]. Population in the prairie provinces fell below natural replacement level. There was also migration from the southern prairies affected by [[Dust Bowl]] conditions such as the [[Palliser's Triangle]] to [[aspen parkland]] in the north.&lt;ref name=Prairie&gt;{{cite book|last=Friesen|first=Gerald|title=The Canadian Prairies: A History|year=1987|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto and London|isbn=0-8020-6648-8|pages=534|edition=Student|pages=383–417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Kamloops on to Ottawa.jpg|thumb|250px|The On-To-Ottawa Trek]]
During the depression, there was a rise of working class militancy organized by the Communist Party. The labour unions largely retreated in response to the ravages of the depression at the same time that significant portions of the working class, including the unemployed, clamoured for collective action. Filling this leadership void was the [[Communist Party of Canada|Communist Party's]] [[Workers' Unity League]], which sought to building a revolutionary trade union movement under a policy of [[dual unionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=William Thomas Easterbrook|author2=Hugh G. J. Aitken|title=Canadian Economic History|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QjmE2bSRzEUC&amp;pg=PA567|year=1989|publisher=U. of Toronto Press|page=567}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Numerous strikes and protests were led by the Communists, many of which culminated in violent clashes with the police. Some notable ones include a coal miners strike that resulted in the [[Estevan Riot]] in [[Estevan, Saskatchewan]] that left three strikers dead by RCMP bullets in 1931, a waterfront strike in [[Vancouver]] that culminated with the &quot;[[Battle of Ballantyne Pier]]&quot; in 1935, and numerous unemployed demonstrations up to and including the [[On-to-Ottawa Trek]] that left one [[Regina Police Service|Regina police]] constable and one protester dead in the &quot;Regina Riot.&quot; Although the actual number of Communist Party militants remained small, their impact was far disproportionate to their numbers, in large part because of the anticommunist reaction of the government, especially the policies of Prime Minister [[R. B. Bennett]] who vowed to crush Communism in Canada with an &quot;iron heel of ruthlessness.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pierre Berton|title=The Great Depression: 1929-1939|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vuVOyizWolgC&amp;pg=PT290|date= 2012|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|page=290}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

These conflicts diminished after 1935, when the Communist Party shifted strategies and Bennett's Conservatives were defeated. Agitation and unrest nonetheless persisted throughout the depression, marked by periodic clashes, such as a sit-down strike in Vancouver that ended with &quot;[[Bloody Sunday (1938)|Bloody Sunday]].&quot; These developments had far-reaching consequences in shaping the postwar environment, including the domestic cold war climate, the rise of the [[welfare state]], and the implementation of an institutional framework for industrial relations.

===Women===
Baillargeon (1999) uses oral histories from 30 women to discover how housewives in the depression handled shortages of money and resources. Often they updated strategies their mothers used when they were growing up in poor families. Cheap foods were used, such as soups, beans and noodles. They purchased the cheapest cuts of meat --sometimes even horse meat--and recycled the Sunday roast into sandwiches and soups. They sewed and patched clothing, traded with their neighbors for outgrown items, and kept the house colder. New furniture and appliances were postponed until better days. These strategies, Baillargeon finds, show that women's domestic labor--cooking, cleaning, budgeting, shopping, childcare--was essential to the economic maintenance of the family and offered room for economies. Most of her informants also worked outside the home, or took boarders, did laundry for trade or cash, and did sewing for neighbors in exchange for something they could offer.  Extended families used mutual aid--extra food, spare rooms, repair-work, cash loans--to help cousins and in-laws.&lt;ref&gt;Denyse Baillargeon, ''Making Do: Women, Family and Home in Montreal during the Great Depression'' (Wilfrid Laurier U. Press, 1999) pp 70, 108, 136-38, 159. &lt;/ref&gt;  Half the devout Catholics defied Church teachings and used contraception to postpone births--the number of births nationwide fell from 250,000 in 1930 to about 228,000 and did not recover until 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=M.C. Urquhart|title=Historical statistics of Canada|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=b5yFAAAAIAAJ|year=1965|publisher=Macmillan|location=Toronto|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Women held 25-30% of the jobs in the cities.&lt;ref&gt; In Toronto women held 28%; in Winnipeg 26%; in Montreal 25%.  Canada, Bureau of the Census, ''Occupations and Industries'' Vol. VII (Ottawa 1931), pp 226, 250, 190.&lt;/ref&gt; Few women were employed in heavy industry, railways or construction. Many were household workers or were employed in restaurants and family-owned shops. Women factory workers typically handled clothing and food. Educated women had a narrow range of jobs, such as clerical work and teaching.  It was expected that a women give up a good job when she married.&lt;ref&gt; Margaret Hobbs and Alice Kessler-Harris, &quot;Rethinking Antifeminism in the 1930s: Gender Crisis or Workplace Justice? A Response to Alice Kessler-Harris,&quot; ''Gender and History,'' (April 1993) 5#1 pp 4-15&lt;/ref&gt;  Srigley emphasizes the wide range of background factors and family circumstances, arguing that &quot;gender&quot; itself was typically less important than race, ethnicity, or class.&lt;ref&gt; Katrina Srigley, &quot;'In Case You Hadn't Noticed!' Race, Ethnicity, and Women's Wage-earning in a Depression-era City.&quot; ''Labour'' 2005 (55): 69-105. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Teachers===
School budgets were cut across the country, although enrollments went up because dropouts could not find jobs. To save money the districts consolidated nearby schools, dropped staff lines, postponed new construction, and increased class size. Middle class well-educated teachers were squeezed by the financial crisis facing their employers. In Ontario, new teachers were not hired so the average age and experience increased. However their salaries fell and men who otherwise would have taken higher status business jobs increasingly competed against women. Married women were not hired on the grounds it was unfair for one family to have two scarce jobs that breadwinners needed. Women teachers, who had made major gains in the 1910-20 era, saw themselves discriminated against.&lt;ref&gt;Cecilia Reynolds and Harry Smaller, &quot;Ontario School Teachers: a Gendered View of the 1930s.&quot; Historical Studies in Education 1994 6(3): 151-169&lt;/ref&gt; The teacher's unions were practically helpless in the crisis, even in Ontario where they were strongest.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Smaller and Andrew Spaull, &quot;The Responses of Canadian Teachers' Unions to the Effects of the 1930s Depression with Emphasis On Ontario,&quot; ''History of Education Review'' (1994) 23#2  pp  55-72 &lt;/ref&gt; After prosperity returned in the 1940s, however, money was available again, there was a shortage of teachers, and the unions proved more effective. For example in Quebec the Corporation Général des Instituteurs et des Institutrices Catholiques (CIC) was founded in 1946 (it became the Centrale de l'Enseignement du Québec (CEQ) in 1967). It sought higher pensions and salaries and better working conditions, while insisting the teachers were full-fledged professionals.&lt;ref&gt;P.A. Côté and M L'Hostie,  &quot;Le Discours syndical sur la formation et le role des enseignants au Quebec, 1930-1990,&quot; ''Historical Studies in Education,'' (March 1993) 5#1 pp 3-31&lt;/ref&gt;  In remote rural areas professionalization was uncommon; local school boards tightly controlled the one-room schools, typically hiring local women with a high school education or a year at university as teachers, so their meagre salaries would remain in the community.&lt;ref&gt; Dianne M. Hallmann, &quot;'A Thing of the Past': Teaching in One-Room Schools in Rural Nova Scotia, 1936-1941,&quot; ''Historical Studies in Education,'' (Spring 1992) 4#1 pp 113-132&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labour policy===
Case studies of four Canadian textile firms—two cotton and two hosiery and knitting—demonstrate the range of business response to the economic crisis. Each faced a different array of conditions, and each devised the appropriate restructuring strategies. The large corporations responded by investing in more expensive machinery and automation, hiring less skilled workers  to tend the automated equipment, and tweaking their product lines to changing consumer tastes. However the smaller hosiery and knitting firms lacked the capital to invest or the research needed to monitor consumer tastes. They used time-tested &quot;Taylorized&quot; scientific management or made piecemeal changes. Power shifted upward to management, as strikes were too risky in the early 1930s and the opportunity to find a better job had drastically narrowed.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Lewis, &quot;The Workplace and Economic Crisis: Canadian Textile Firms, 1929-1935,&quot; ''Enterprise and Society'' (Sept. 2009) 10#3 pp 498-528&lt;/ref&gt; By 1935, however, the influence of militant American unions spilled over the border and Canadian unions became more forceful and harmonous. The activity was most notable in Ontario's automobile factories, beginning in Windsor in late 1936, where the new Automobile Workers of America (UAW) chartered its first Canadian local at the Kelsey-Hayes factory.&lt;ref&gt;John Manley, &quot;Communists and Auto Workers: The Struggle for Industrial Unionism in the Canadian Automobile Industry, 1925-36,&quot; ''Labour / Le Travail'' (Spring 1986) Vol. 17, pp 105-133&lt;/ref&gt;

==World trade==
The Stock Market crash in New York led people to hoard their money; as consumption fell, the American economy steadily contracted, 1929-32. Given the close economic links between the two countries, the collapse quickly affected Canada. Added to the woes of the prairies were those of [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]], whose manufacturing industries were now victims of overproduction. Massive lay-offs occurred and other companies collapsed into bankruptcy. This collapse was not as sharp as that in the United States, but was the second sharpest collapse in the world.

Canada did have some advantages over other countries, especially its extremely stable banking system that had no failures during the entire depression, compared to over 9,000 small banks that collapsed in the United States.

Canada was hurt badly because of its reliance and other commodities, whose prices fell by over 50%, and because of the importance of international trade.  In the 1920s about 25% of the Canadian Gross National Product was derived from exports. The first reaction of the U.S. was to raise tariffs via the [[Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act]], passed into law June 17, 1930. This hurt the Canadian economy more than most other countries in the world, and Canada retaliated by raising its own rates on American imports and by switching business to the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Richard N. Kottman, &quot;Herbert Hoover and the Smoot-Hawley Tariff: Canada, A Case Study,&quot; ''Journal of American History,'' Vol. 62, No. 3 (Dec., 1975), pp. 609-635&lt;/ref&gt;

In an angry response to Smoot–Hawley, Canada welcomed the British introduction of trade protectionism and a system of Commonwealth preference during the winter of 1931-32. It helped Canada avoid external default on their public debt during the Great Depression. Canada had a high degree of exposure to the international economy - for example, in the 1920s about 25% of the Canadian GDP came from exports - which left Canada susceptible to any international economic downturn. The onset of the depression created critical balance of payment deficits, and it was largely the extension of imperial protection by Britain that gave Canada the opportunity to increase their exports to the British market. By 1938 Britain was importing more than twice the 1929 volume of products from Australia, while the value of products shipped from Canada more than doubled, despite the dramatic drop in prices. Thus, the British market played a vital role in helping Canada and Australia stabilize their balance of payments in the immensely difficult economic conditions of the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Rooth and Rebecca Taylor, &quot;Exports and External Adjustment during the Slump: The British Market, Australia and Canada During the 1930s,&quot; ''Journal of European Economic History'' 2001 30(3): 569-595&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government reaction==
At the Depression, the provincial and municipal governments were already in debt after an expansion of infrastructure and education during the 1920s. It thus fell to the federal government to try to improve the economy. When the Depression began [[Mackenzie King]] was [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]]. He believed that the crisis would pass, refused to provide federal aid to the provinces, and only introduced moderate relief efforts.

===New Deal===
The Bennett Government initially refused to offer large-scale aid or relief to the provinces, much to the anger of provincial premiers, but it eventually gave in and started a Canadian &quot;New Deal&quot; type of relief by 1935. By 1937, the worst of the Depression had passed, but it left its mark on the country's economic landscape. [[Atlantic Canada]] was especially hard hit. [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] (an independent dominion at the time) was bankrupt economically and politically and gave up responsible government by reverting to direct British control.

World War I veterans built on a history of postwar political activism to play an important role in the expansion of state-sponsored social welfare in Canada. Arguing that their wartime sacrifices had not been properly rewarded, veterans claimed that they were entitled to state protection from poverty and unemployment on the home front. The rhetoric of patriotism, courage, sacrifice, and duty created powerful demands for jobs, relief, and adequate pensions that should, veterans argued, be administered as a right of [[social citizenship]] and not a form of charity. At the local, provincial, and national political levels, veterans fought for compensation and recognition for their war service, and made their demands for jobs and social security a central part of emerging social policy.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Blaming it on Bennett.jpg|thumb|upright|''Blaming it on Bennett'': A 1931 political cartoon suggests that Liberals had failed to take responsibility for their own errors.]]

The [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] lost the [[Canadian federal election, 1930|1930 election]] to the [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative Party]], led by [[R.B. Bennett]]. Bennett, a successful western businessman, campaigned on high tariffs and large-scale spending. Make-work programs were begun, and [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] and other assistance programs became vastly larger. This led to a large federal deficit, however. Bennett became wary of the budget shortfalls by 1932, and cut back severely on federal spending. This only deepened the depression as government employees were put out of work and public works projects were canceled.

One of the greatest burdens on the government was the [[Canadian National Railway]] (CNR). The federal government had taken over a number of defunct and bankrupt railways during World War I and the 1920s. The debt the government assumed was over $2 billion, a massive sum at the time, but during the boom years it seemed payable. The Depression turned this debt into a crushing burden. Due to the decrease in trade, the CNR also began to lose substantial amounts of money during the Depression, and had to be further bailed out by the government.

With falling support and the depression only getting worse, Bennett attempted to introduce policies based on the [[New Deal]] of [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] in the United States. Bennett thus called for a [[minimum wage]], [[unemployment insurance]], and other such programs. This effort was largely unsuccessful; the provinces challenged the rights of the federal government to manage these programs.

The judicial and political failure of Bennett's New Deal legislation shifted the struggle to reconstitute capitalism to the provincial and municipal levels of the state. Attempts to deal with the dislocations of the Great Depression in Ontario focused on the &quot;sweatshop crisis&quot; that came to dominate political and social discourse after 1934. Ontario's 1935 [[Industrial Standards Act]] (ISA) was designed to bring workers and employers together under the auspices of the state to establish minimum wages and work standards. The establishment of New Deal style industrial codes was premised on the mobilization of organized capital and organized labour to combat unfair competition, stop the spread of relief-subsidized labour, and halt the predations of sweatshop capitalism. Although the ISA did not bring about extensive economic regulation, it excited considerable interest in the possibility of government intervention. Workers in a diverse range of occupations, from asbestos workers to waitresses, attempted to organize around the possibility of the ISA. The importance of the ISA lies in what it reveals about the nature of welfare, wage labour, the union movement, competitive capitalism, business attitudes toward industrial regulation, and the role of the state in managing the collective affairs of capitalism. The history of the ISA also suggests that &quot;regulatory unionism,&quot; as described by Colin Gordon in his work on the American New Deal, may have animated key developments in Canadian social, economic, and labour history.&lt;ref&gt;Klee (2000); Colin Gordon, ''New Deals: Business, Labor, and Politics in America, 1920-1935'' (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

The failure to help the economy led to the federal Conservative's defeat in the [[Canadian federal election, 1935|1935 election]] when the Liberals, still led by Mackenzie King, returned to power.

The public at large lost faith in both the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] and the [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative Party of Canada]]. This caused the rise of a [[Third party (politics)|third party]]: the [[Cooperative Commonwealth Federation]] (a socialist party that achieved some success before joining the [[Canadian Labour Congress]] in 1961, becoming the [[New Democratic Party]]).

With the worst of the Depression over. The government implemented some relief programs such as the [[National Housing Act (Canada)|National Housing Act]] and [[National Employment Commission (Canada)|National Employment Commission]], and it established Trans-Canada Airlines (1937, the predecessor to [[Air Canada]]). However, it took until 1939 and the outbreak of war for the Canadian economy to return to 1929 levels.

===Liberals return===
The onset of the Depression led to a Liberal defeat in the 1930 elections. In opposition, it was [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]]'s policy to refrain from offering advice and to let the Conservative government under Bennett make its mistakes; Mackenzie King's policy preferences were not radically different. Though he gave the impression of sympathy with progressive and liberal causes, he had no enthusiasm for the [[New Deal]] of American President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] (which Bennett tried to emulate), and he never advocated massive government action to alleviate depression in Canada.

In 1935 the Liberals used the slogan &quot;King or Chaos&quot; to win a landslide. Promising a much-desired trade treaty with the U.S., the Mackenzie King government passed the 1935 Reciprocal Trade Agreement. It marked the turning point in Canadian–American economic relations, reversing the disastrous trade war of 1930–31, lowering tariffs, and yielding a dramatic increase in trade; more subtly, it revealed to the prime minister and the president that they could work together well.&lt;ref&gt;Marc T. Boucher, &quot;The Politics of Economic Depression: Canadian-American Relations in the Mid-1930s.&quot; ''International Journal'' 1985-1986 41(1): 3-36. Issn: 0020-7020; H. Blair Neatby, ''William Lyon Mackenzie King: 1932-1939'' (1976) pp 143-48.&lt;/ref&gt; 

After 1936 the prime minister lost patience when westerners preferred radical alternatives such as the CCF (Co-operative Commonwealth Federation) and Social Credit to his middle-of-the-road liberalism. Indeed, he came close to writing off the region with his comment that the prairie dust bowl was &quot;part of the U.S. desert area. I doubt if it will be of any real use again.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Wardhaugh, ''Mackenzie King and the Prairie West'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead he paid more attention to the industrial regions and the needs of Ontario and Quebec regarding the proposed St. Lawrence Seaway project with the United States.  As for the unemployed, he was hostile to federal relief and reluctantly accepted a Keynesian solution that involved federal deficit spending, tax cuts and subsidies to the housing market.&lt;ref&gt;H. Blair Neatby, ''The Politics of Chaos: Canada in the Thirties ''(1972) p. 84-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mackenzie King returned as prime minister, serving until his retirement in 1948. During all but the last two years he was also secretary of state for external affairs, taking personal charge of foreign policy.

===Social Credit===
'''Social Credit''' (often called ''Socred'') was a populist political movement strongest in Alberta and neighboring [[British Columbia]], 1930s-1970s.  [[Social Credit]] was based on the economic theories of an Englishman, [[C. H. Douglas]]. His theories became very popular across the nation in the early 1930s. A central proposal was the free distribution of prosperity certificates (or social credit), called &quot;funny money&quot; by the opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Hesketh, ''Major Douglas and Alberta Social Credit.'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Great Depression]] in Canada the demand for radical action peaked around 1934, after the worst period was over and the economy was recovering. Mortgage debt was significant because farmers could not meet their interest payments. The insecurity of farmers, whose debts were increasing and who had no legal protection against foreclosure, was a potent factor in creating a mood of political desperation. The radical farmers party, UFA was baffled by the depression and Albertans demanded new leadership.

The prairie farmers had always believed that they were being exploited by Toronto and Montreal.  What they lacked was a prophet who would lead them to the promised land. The Social Credit movement began in Alberta in 1932; it became a political movement in 1935 and suddenly burned like a prairie fire.  The prophet and new premier was radio evangelist [[William Aberhart]] (1878–1943). The message was biblical prophecy.  Aberhart was a fundamentalist, preaching the revealed word of God and quoting the Bible to find a solution for the evils of the modern, materialistic world: the evils of sophisticated academics and their biblical criticism, the cold formality of middle-class congregations, the vices of dancing and movies and drink. &quot;Bible Bill&quot; preached that the capitalist economy was rotten because of its immorality; specifically it produced goods and services but did not provide people with sufficient purchasing power to enjoy them. This could be remedied by the giving out money in the form of &quot;social credit&quot;, or $25 a month for every man and woman.  This pump priming was guaranteed to restore prosperity, he prophesied to the 1600 Social Credit clubs he formed in the province.

Alberta's businessmen, professionals, newspaper editors and the traditional middle-class leaders vehemently protested Aberhart's crack-pot ideas, but they had not solved any problems and spoke not of the promised land ahead.  Aberhart's new party in 1935 elected 56 members to the Alberta Assembly, compared to 7 for all the other parties.&lt;ref&gt;The economic theorist for Aberhart was Major Douglas, an English engineer with an unbounded confidence in technology. *  H. Blair Neatby, ''The Politics of Chaos: Canada in the Thirties''  (1972) pp 143-61; John A. Irving, ''The Social Credit Movement in Alberta'' (1959)&lt;/ref&gt;

Alberta's Social Credit Party remained in power for 36 years until 1971. It was re-elected by popular vote no less than 9 times, achieving success by moving from left to the right.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Flanagan and Martha F. Lee, &quot;From Social Credit to Social Conservatism: The Evolution of an Ideology,&quot; ''Prairie Forum'' 16 (1991): 205-223; C. B. Macpherson, ''Democracy in Alberta: Social Credit and the Party System.'' 2d ed. 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social Credit in office====
Once in office in Alberta Aberhart gave a high priority to balancing the provincial budget. He reduced expenditures and increased the sales tax and the income tax.  The poor and unemployed got nothing.&lt;ref&gt;Alvin Finkel,  &quot;Social Credit and the Unemployed.&quot; ''Alberta History'' 1983 31(2): 24-32.&lt;/ref&gt; The $25 monthly social dividend never arrived, as Aberhart decided nothing could be done until the province's financial system was changed, and 1936 Alberta defaulted on its bonds.  He did pass a Debt Adjustment Act that canceled all the interest on mortgages since 1932 and limited all interest rates on mortgages to 5%, in line with similar laws passed by other provinces. In 1937 backbenchers passed a radical banking law that was disallowed by the national government (banking was a federal responsibility). Efforts to control the press were also disallowed.  The party was authoritarian and tried to exert detailed control over its officeholders; those who rebelled were purged or removed from office by the new device of recall elections.  Although Aberhart was hostile to banks and newspapers, he was basically in favor of capitalism and did not support socialist policies as did the [[Cooperative Commonwealth Federation]] (CCF) in Saskatchewan.&lt;ref&gt;In Alberta the CCF and Social Credit were bitter enemies, which made it impossible for them to merge in Saskatchewan. See S. M. Lipset, ''Agrarian Socialism: The Cooperative Commonwealth Federation in Saskatchewan a Study in Political Sociology.'' (1950, 1971 ed.) p. 143-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1938 the Social Credit government abandoned its notions about the $25 payouts, but its inability to break with UFA policies led to disillusionment and heavy defections from the party. Aberhart's government was re-elected in the [[Alberta general election, 1940|1940 election]], carrying 43% of the vote. The prosperity of the Second World War relieved the economic fears and hatreds that had fueled farmer unrest. Aberhart died in 1943, and was succeeded as Premier by his student at the Prophetic Bible Institute and lifelong close disciple, [[Ernest C. Manning]] (1908–1996).

The Social Credit party, now firmly on the right, governed Alberta until 1968 under Manning.

==Recovery==
The Canadian recovery from the Great Depression proceeded slowly. Economists Pedro Amaral and James MacGee find that the Canadian recovery has important differences with the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Amaral, Pedro and James C. MacGee &quot;The Great Depression in Canada and the United States: A Neoclassical Perspective&quot; in Kehoe, Prescott (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the U.S. productivity recovered quickly while the labor force remained depressed throughout the decade.  In Canada employment quickly recovered but productivity remained well below trend.  Amaral and MacGee suggest that this decline is due to the sustained reduction in international trade during the 1930s.

In the midst of the Great Depression, the [[Queen-in-Council|Crown-in-Council]] attempted to uplift the people, and created two national corporations: the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission]] (CRBC), and the [[Bank of Canada]]. The former, established in 1932, was seen as a means to keep the country unified and uplifted in these harsh economic times. Many poor citizens found radio as an escape and used it to restore their own faiths in a brighter future. Broadcasting coast to coast in both French and English, the CRBC played a vital role in keeping the morale up for Canadians everywhere. The latter was used to regulate currency and credit which had been horribly managed amongst Canadian citizens in the prior years. It was also set up to serve as a private banker’s bank and to assist and advise the Canadian government on its own debts and financial matters. The bank played an important role to help steer government spending in the right direction. The bank's effort took place through the tough years off the depression and on to the prosperity that followed into and after the Second World War.

Both of these corporations were seen as positive moves by the Canadian government to help get the economy back on track. 1937 was an important year in the recovery from the Great Depression. The Bank of Canada was nationalized in that year, and the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission (CRBC) became the Canadian Broadcasting Company (CBC) in that same year. Both corporations were successful aids in the cultural and financial recovery of the Canadian economy during the Great depression.

It took the outbreak of [[World War II]] to pull Canada out of the depression. From 1939, an increased demand in Europe for materials, and increased spending by the Canadian government created a strong boost for the economy. Unemployed men enlisted in the military. By 1939, Canada was in the first prosperity period in the [[business cycle]] in a decade. This coincided with the recovery in the American economy, which created a better market for exports and a new inflow of much needed capital.
