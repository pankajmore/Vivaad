      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="103249">{{History of Spain}}
The '''history of Spain''' involves all the other peoples and nations within the Iberian peninsula formerly known as ''[[Hispania]]'', and includes still today the nations of [[Andorra]], [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]], and the British overseas territory of [[Gibraltar]]. It spans from [[prehistoric Iberia]], through the rise and decline of a [[Spanish Empire|global empire]], to the recent history of Spain as a member of the [[European Union]].

[[Modern humans]] entered the [[Iberian Peninsula]] about 32,000 years ago. Different populations and cultures followed over the millennia, including the [[Iberians]], the [[Tartessians]], [[Celts]] and [[Celtiberians]], [[Phoenicia]]ns, [[Greeks]], [[Carthaginians]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Suebi]] and [[Visigoths]].

In 711,  the [[Moors]], a [[Berber people|Berber]] and [[Arab]] army, invaded and conquered nearly the entire peninsula. During the next 750 years, independent [[Muslim]] states were established, and the entire area of Muslim control became known as [[Al-Andalus]]. Meanwhile the [[Christian]] kingdoms in the north began the long and slow recovery of the peninsula, a process called the ''[[Reconquista]]'', which was concluded in 1492 with the fall of [[Granada]].

Over time, various [[petty kingdom]]s and other states{{clarify|date=September 2012}} on the peninsula began to coalesce into larger states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=DteXifpgh_UC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=the+spains&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=DTarTePwA4ip8APmpeC4Ag&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20spains&amp;f=false Spain's centuries of crisis: your fucked 
1300-1474 pg2]&lt;/ref&gt;  Three kingdoms came to dominate Iberia by the 15th century, those being the [[Kingdom of Portugal]], [[Kingdom of Castile]], and [[Kingdom of Aragon]].  The [[dynastic union]] of the crowns of the [[Kingdom of Castile]] and the [[Kingdom of Aragon]] in 1492 is seen frequently as the starting pont of the unification of the modern [[kingdom of Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/eurvoya/Imperial.html European Voyages of Exploration: Imperial Spain]&lt;/ref&gt; Although colloquially and literarily the expression &quot;King of Spain&quot; or &quot;King of the Spains&quot; was already widespread,&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=4aYgR5YFEtAC&amp;pg=PA137&amp;dq=felipe+iv+por+la+gracia+de+dios+rey&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=09qhTY-OJcuw8QOjubyoAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=felipe%20iv%20por%20la%20gracia%20de%20dios%20rey&amp;f=false Felipe IV: el hombre y el reinado pg 137]&lt;/ref&gt; and the two crowns were ruled by the same monarch, they retained their individual institutions and identity until 1812, with the enactment of the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/9858/1/1812Cadiz.pdf Peña,Lorenzo. Un puente jurídico entre Iberoamérica y Europa:la Constitución española de 1812. Instituto de Filosofía del CSIC] {{Cita|The first thing there is to understand is that in a good measure, the Courts of Cadiz created a new state, the Spanish state.[...]there had never been a proclamation of a Kingdom of Spain, so that difficulties always arose upon the legal value of the very frequent references to 'Spain' in the legal texts of the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.
The Spanish sovereigns had always refused the advice [...] in the sense of establishing a United Kingdom of Spain, preferring to see themselves as vertices of converging scattered kingdoms, at least in theory. Even the Napoleonic Bayonne Constitution of 1808 did not proclaime a kingdom of Spain, but a 'Crown of Spain and the Indies'. On the other hand, 'Spain' was merely a geographical name, a simple romance version of 'Hispania',whereby its use, in principle, should not have to go beyond the designations ‘Galia’, ‘Germania’[...]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Portugal was briefly also ruled by the House of Habsburg with Castile and Aragon in the [[Iberian Union]], but this short-lived arrangement was never popular in Portugal; Portugal after 60 years refused to be ruled by the Habsburg king.

The first voyage of [[Christopher Columbus]] to the [[New World]] took place in 1492 as well, beginning the development of the [[Spanish Empire]]. The [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]] was established and [[Jew]]s and [[Muslim]]s who refused to convert were expelled from the country.

For the next century and a half, Spain was the most powerful state{{clarify|date=September 2012}} in Europe and the largest overseas empire in the world for three centuries. [[Spanish Golden Age#Literature|Spanish literature]] and [[Spanish Golden Age#Painting|fine arts]], scholarship and philosophy flourished during the 16th and 17th centuries. Spain established a vast empire in the Americas, stretching from [[California]] to [[Patagonia]], and colonies in the western Pacific. Financed in part by the riches pouring in from its colonies&lt;!---The silver was very important, but the vast majority of the finance actually originated in taxation from Spain---&gt;, Spain became embroiled in the religiously charged wars and intrigues of Europe, including, for example, through its possessions in western Europe, engaging in wars with France, England, Sweden, and the [[Ottomans]]  and in the Mediterranean and northern Africa. 

Spain's European wars led to economic damage, and the latter part of the 17th century saw a gradual decline of power under an increasingly neglectful and inept [[Habsburg]] regime. The decline culminated in the [[War of Spanish Succession]], which ended with the relegation of Spain to the status of a second rate western power, although it remained, with Russia, the leading colonial power of the 18th century.

The 18th century saw a new dynasty, the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]], which directed considerable efforts towards the renewal of state institutions, with some success, finishing in a successful involvement in the [[American War of Independence]]. However, as the century ended, a reaction set in with the accession of a new monarch. The end of the 18th and the start of the 19th centuries saw turmoil unleashed throughout Europe by the [[French Revolution]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]], which led to French occupation of much of the continent, including Spain.

This triggered a successful but devastating war for Spanish independence that shattered the country and created an opening for what would ultimately be the successful independence of Spain's mainland American colonies. Fragmented by the war, Spain was destabilised as different political parties representing &quot;liberal&quot;, &quot;reactionary&quot; and &quot;moderate&quot; groups throughout the remainder of the century fought for and won short-lived control without any being sufficiently strong to bring about lasting stability. Nationalist movements emerged in the last significant remnants of the old empire ([[Cuba]] and the [[Philippines]]) which led to a brief war with the United States (1898) and the loss of the remaining old colonies at the end of the century.

It was only in [[Spanish Constitution of 1812|the constitution of 1812]] that the name &quot;Españas&quot; for the Spanish kingdom and the use of the title of &quot;King of the Spains&quot; were officially adopted .&lt;ref&gt;[http://bib.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/c1812/12260843118006070754624/ima0138.htm Constitución política de la Monarquía Española Promulgada en Cádiz a 19 de Marzo de 1812]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|The constitution of 1876]] adopted for the first time the name &quot;España&quot; (&quot;Spain&quot;) for the Spanish nation, and from then on monarchs used the title of &quot;King of Spain&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=RaC85UYvbtIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=espanas+espana+nacion-estado&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=cKihTfmzA5fS4wa6yb2bAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Estado y territorio en España, 1820-1930: la formación del paisaje nacional pg 25-26]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following a period of growing political instability in the early 20th century, in 1936 Spain was plunged into a [[Spanish Civil War|bloody civil war]]. The war ended in a nationalist dictatorship, led by [[Francisco Franco]], which controlled the Spanish government until 1975. Spain was officially neutral during World War II (1939-1945), although many Spanish volunteers fought on both sides. The post-war decades were relatively stable (with the notable exception of an armed independence [[ETA|movement]] in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]]), and the country experienced rapid economic growth in the 1960s and early 1970s. 

The death of Franco in 1975 resulted in the return of the Bourbon monarchy headed by Prince Juan Carlos. While tensions remain (for example, with Muslim immigrants and in the Basque region), modern Spain has seen the development of a robust, modern democracy as a [[constitutional monarchy]] with popular [[King Juan Carlos]], one of the fastest-growing standards of living in Europe, entry into the [[European Community]], and the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] and 1982 World Cup.

The earliest record of [[hominids]] living in Europe has been found in the Spanish cave of [[Archaeological Site of Atapuerca|Atapuerca]]; [[fossils]] found there date to roughly 1.2 million years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;encarta&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Spain|url=http://encarta.msn.com/text_761575057___0/Spain.html|encyclopedia=Encarta Online Encyclopedia|year=2007|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwqnGivb|archivedate=2009-10-31|deadurl=yes}} See also: {{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6256356.stm|title='First west Europe tooth' found|publisher=BBC|date=30 June 2007|accessdate=2008-08-09|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwqnGivb|archivedate=2009-10-31|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern humans in the form of [[Cro-Magnons]] began arriving in the Iberian Peninsula from north of the [[Pyrenees]] some 35,000 years ago. The most conspicuous sign of prehistoric human settlements are the famous [[cave paintings|paintings]] in the northern Spanish cave of [[Altamira (cave)|Altamira]], which were done c. 15,000 [[Before Christ|BC]] and are regarded as paramount instances of [[cave art]].&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica prehistory&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Spain - History - Pre-Roman Spain - Prehistory|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/557573/Spain/214578/History#toc=toc70344|encyclopedia=Britannica Online Encyclopedia|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, archeological evidence in places like [[Los Millares]] and [[El Argar]], both in the [[province of Almería]], suggests developed cultures existed in the eastern part of the Iberian Peninsula during the late [[Neolithic]] and the [[Bronze Age]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Chapman, ''Emerging Complexity: The Later Prehistory of South-East Spain, Iberia and the West Mediterranean'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

The seafaring Phoenicians, Greeks and Carthaginians successively settled along the Mediterranean Sea near [[Tartessos]], modern day Cádiz.  According to John Koch,&lt;ref name=Koch2009/&gt; Cunliffe, Karl, Wodtko and other scholars, Celtic culture may have developed first in far Southern Portugal and Southwestern Spain, approximately 500 years prior to anything recorded in Central Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cunliffe, Karl, Guerra, McEvoy, Bradley; Oppenheimer, Rrvik, Isaac, Parsons, Koch, Freeman and Wodtko|title=Celtic from the West: Alternative Perspectives from Archaeology, Genetics, Language and Literature|year=2010|publisher=Oxbow Books and Celtic Studies Publications|isbn=978-1-84217-410-4|pages=384|url=http://www.oxbowbooks.com/bookinfo.cfm/ID/88298//Location/DBBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rethinking the Bronze Age and the Arrival of Indo-European in Atlantic Europe|url=http://www.oxbowbooks.com/pdfs/books/Celtic%20West%20conf.pdf|publisher=University of Wales Centre for Advanced Welsh and Celtic Studies and Institute of Archaeology, University of Oxford|accessdate=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tartessian language]] from the southwest of the Iberian peninsula, written in a version of the Phoenician script in use around 825 BC, which [[John T.

In the 9th century BC, the first Greek colonies, such as Emporion (modern [[Empúries]]), were founded along the Mediterranean coast on the east, leaving the south coast to the Phoenicians. The Greeks are responsible for the name ''Iberia'', apparently after the river Iber ([[Ebro]] in Spanish). In the 6th century BC, the [[Carthaginian]]s arrived in Iberia, struggling first with the Greeks, and shortly after, with the newly arriving Romans for control of the Western Mediterranean. Their most important colony was [[Carthago Nova]] (Latin name of modern day [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica phoenicians&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Spain - History - Pre-Roman Spain - Phoenicians | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/557573/Spain/70346/Phoenicians#toc=toc70346|encyclopedia=Britannica Online Encyclopedia | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The native peoples whom the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] met at the time of their [[invasion]] in what is now known as Spain were the [[Iberians]], inhabiting an area stretching from the southwest part of the Peninsula through the northeast part of it, and then the [[Celts]], mostly inhabiting the north and northwest part of the Peninsula. In the inner part of the Peninsula, where both groups were in contact, a mixed, distinctive, culture arose, called [[Celtiberians|Celtiberian]].&lt;ref name=&quot;encarta&quot;/&gt; The [[Celtiberian Wars]] or Spanish Wars were fought between the advancing [[Roman legion|legions]] of the Roman Republic and the Celtiberian tribes of Hispania Citerior from 181 to 133 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Grout | first=James | title=The Celtiberian War | url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/hispania/celtiberianwar.html | work=Encyclopaedia Romana|publisher=University of Chicago | year=2007|accessdate=2008-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Major Phases in Roman History|url=http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~corbett/clab42/RomChron.htm|work=Rome in the Mediterranean World | publisher=University of Toronto|accessdate=2008-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further|Romanization of Hispania}}

[[Image:Cordoba, Roman Bridge and Mosque-Cathedral.jpg|thumb|300px|A [[Roman Republic|Roman]] bridge in [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Córdoba]]]]
[[Hispania]] was divided: [[Hispania Ulterior]] and [[Hispania Citerior]] during the late [[Roman Republic]]; during the [[Roman Empire]], [[Hispania Taraconensis]] in the northeast, [[Hispania Baetica]] in the south (roughly corresponding to [[Andalucia]]), and [[Lusitania]] in the southwest (corresponding to modern Portugal).&lt;ref&gt;J. S. Richardson, ''The Romans in Spain'' (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

The base Celtiberian population remained in various stages of [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanisation]],&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[latifundia]]'' (sing., ''latifundium''), large estates controlled by the aristocracy, were superimposed on the existing Iberian landholding system.&lt;/ref&gt; and local leaders were admitted into the Roman aristocratic class.&lt;ref name=&quot;country&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Rinehart |first=Robert |coauthors=Seeley, Jo Ann Browning | title = A Country Study: Spain - Hispania |publisher=Library of Congress Country Series |year=1998 |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/estoc.html |accessdate=2008-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romans improved existing cities, such as [[Tarragona]] (''Tarraco''), and established others like [[Zaragoza]] (''Caesaraugusta''), [[Mérida, Spain|Mérida]] (''Augusta Emerita''), [[Valencia]] (''Valentia''), [[León, Spain|León]] (&quot;Legio Septima&quot;), [[Badajoz]] (&quot;Pax Augusta&quot;), and [[Palencia]].&lt;ref&gt;The Roman provinces of Hispania included ''Provincia Hispania Ulterior Baetica ([[Hispania Baetica]])'', whose capital was [[Córdoba, Spain|Corduba, presently Córdoba]], ''Provincia Hispania Ulterior Lusitania'' ([[Hispania Lusitania]]), whose capital was Emerita Augusta (now [[Mérida, Spain|Mérida]]), ''Provincia Hispania Citerior'', whose capital was [[Tarraco]] (Tarragona), ''Provincia Hispania Nova'', whose capital was [[Tingis]] (Tánger in present Morocco), ''Provincia Hispania Nova Citerior'' and ''Asturiae-Calleciae'' (these latter two provinces were created and then dissolved in the 3rd&amp;nbsp;century AD).&lt;/ref&gt; The peninsula's economy expanded under Roman tutelage. Hispania supplied Rome with food, olive oil, wine and metal. The emperors [[Trajan]], [[Hadrian]], and [[Theodosius I]], the philosopher [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], and the poets [[Martial]], [[Quintilian]], and [[Lucan (poet)|Lucan]] were born in Spain. Spanish Bishops held the [[Council of Elvira]] around 306.

The collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]] did not lead to the same wholesale destruction of Western classical society as happened in areas like [[Roman Britain]], [[Gaul]] and [[Germania Inferior]] during the [[Early Middle Ages|Dark Ages]], although the institutions, infrastructure and economy did suffer considerable degradation. Spain's present languages, its religion, and the basis of its laws originate from this period. The centuries of uninterrupted Roman rule and settlement left a deep and enduring imprint upon the culture of Spain.

==Germanic Rule of Hispania (5th&amp;ndash;8th centuries)==
{{further|Visigothic Kingdom|Suebic Kingdom of Galicia|Spania}}

[[Image:Hispania 700 AD.PNG|thumb|350px|[[Visigoth]]ic Hispania and its regional divisions in 700, prior to the Muslim conquest.]]

The first [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]] to invade Hispania arrived in the 5th&amp;nbsp;century, as the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|Roman Empire decayed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Payne |first=Stanley G. | title = A History of Spain and Portugal; Ch. 1 Ancient Hispania |publisher=The Library of Iberian Resources Online |year=1973 |url=http://libro.uca.edu/payne1/spainport1.htm |accessdate=2008-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Visigoths]], [[Suebi]], [[Vandals]] and [[Alans]] arrived in Spain by crossing the Pyrenees mountain range.&lt;ref&gt;This led to the establishment of the [[Suebi#Kingdom in Gallaecia|Suebi Kingdom]] in [[Gallaecia]], in the northwest, the [[Vandals#In Iberia|Vandal Kingdom]] of Vandalusia (Andalusia) and the [[Visigoths#Kingdom of Toledo|Visigothic Kingdom]] in Toledo.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanized]] Visigoths entered Hispania in 415. After the conversion of their monarchy to [[Roman Catholicism]] and after conquering the disordered Suebic territories in the northwest and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] territories in the southeast, the Visigothic Kingdom eventually encompassed a great part of the Iberian Peninsula.&lt;ref name=&quot;country&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roger Collins, ''Visigothic Spain 409&amp;ndash;711'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

After the decline of the [[Roman Empire]], [[Germanic tribes]] invaded the former empire. Several turned sedentary and created successor-kingdoms to the Romans in various parts of Europe. [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] was taken over by the [[Visigoths]] after 410.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Eva Carr, ''Vandals to Visigoths: Rural Settlement Patterns in Early Medieval Spain'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Iberian peninsula, as elsewhere, the Empire fell not with a bang but with a whimper. Rather than there being any convenient date for the &quot;fall of the Roman Empire&quot; there was a progressive &quot;de-Romanization&quot; of the Western Roman Empire in Hispania and a weakening of central authority, throughout the 3rd, 4th and 5th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Rhea Marsh Smith, ''Spain: A Modern History'' (University of Michigan: Ann Arbor, 1965) p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, there was a process of &quot;Romanization&quot; of the Germanic and Hunnic tribes settled on both sides of the ''[[limes]]'' (the fortified frontier of the Empire along the [[Rhine]] and [[Danube]] rivers). The Visigoths, for example, were converted to [[Arianism|Arian Christianity]] around 360, even before they were pushed into imperial territory by the expansion of the [[Huns]].&lt;ref&gt;Rhea Marsh Smith, ''Spain: A Modern History'', p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the winter of 406, taking advantage of the frozen Rhine, the ([[Germanic tribes|Germanic]]) [[Vandals]] and [[Sueves]], and the ([[Sarmatian]]) [[Alans]] invaded the empire in force. Three years later they crossed the [[Pyrenees]] into [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] and divided the Western parts, roughly corresponding to modern Portugal and western Spain as far as [[Madrid]], between them.&lt;ref&gt;Rhea Marsh Smith, ''Spain: A Modern History'', p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Visigoths meanwhile, having sacked Rome two years earlier, arrived in the region in 412 founding the Visigothic kingdom of [[Toulouse]] (in the south of modern France) and gradually expanded their influence into the Iberian peninsula at the expense of the Vandals and Alans, who moved on into North Africa without leaving much permanent mark on Hispanic culture. The [[Visigoths#Visigothic kingdom in Hispania|Visigothic Kingdom]] shifted its capital to [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] and reached a high point during the reign of [[Leovigild]].

Importantly, Spain never saw a decline in interest in classical culture to the degree observable in Britain, Gaul, Lombardy and Germany. The Visigoths tended to maintain more of the old Roman institutions, and they had a unique respect for legal codes that resulted in continuous frameworks and historical records for most of the period between 415, when Visigothic rule in Spain began, and 711, when it is traditionally said to end. 

The proximity of the Visigothic kingdoms to the Mediterranean and the continuity of western Mediterranean trade, though in reduced quantity, supported Visigothic culture. Arian Visigothic nobility kept apart from the local Catholic population. The Visigothic ruling class looked to [[Constantinople]] for style and technology while the rivals of Visigothic power and culture were the Catholic bishops – and a brief incursion of Byzantine power in Córdoba. 

[[image:Visigothic Kingdom.png|thumb|350px|The greatest extent of the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] of [[Toulouse]], c. 500, showing Territory lost after [[Battle of Vouillé|Vouillé]] in light orange.]] 

Spanish catholic religion also coalesced during this time. The period of rule by the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] saw the spread of [[Arianism]] briefly in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Rhea Marsh Smith, ''Spain: A Modern History'', pp. 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Councils of Toledo]] debated creed and liturgy in orthodox [[Catholicism]], and the Council of Lerida in 546 constrained the clergy and extended the power of law over them under the blessings of Rome. In 587, the Visigothic king at Toledo, [[Reccared]], converted to Catholicism and launched a movement in Spain to unify the various religious doctrines that existed in the land. This put an end to dissension on the question of Arianism. For additional information about this period, see the [[History of Roman Catholicism in Spain]].

The Visigoths inherited from Late Antiquity a sort of [[feudal]] system in Spain, based in the south on the Roman [[villa]] system and in the north drawing on their vassals to supply troops in exchange for protection. The bulk of the Visigothic army was composed of slaves, raised from the countryside. The loose council of nobles that advised Spain's Visigothic kings and legitimized their rule was responsible for raising the army, and only upon its consent was the king able to summon soldiers.

The impact of Visigothic rule was not widely felt on society at large, and certainly not compared to the vast bureaucracy of the Roman Empire; they tended to rule as barbarians of a mild sort, uninterested in the events of the nation and economy, working for personal benefit, and little literature remains to us from the period. They did not, until the period of Muslim rule, merge with the Spanish population, preferring to remain separate, and indeed the Visigothic language left only the faintest mark on the modern languages of Iberia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collins, 2006&quot;&gt;Collins, ''Visigothic Spain 409&amp;ndash;711'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

The most visible effect was the depopulation of the cities as they moved to the countryside. Even while the country enjoyed a degree of prosperity when compared to the famines of France and Germany in this period, the Visigoths felt little reason to contribute to the welfare, permanency, and infrastructure of their people and state. This contributed to their downfall, as they could not count on the loyalty of their subjects when the Moors arrived in the 8th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collins, 2006&quot;/&gt;

==Islamic ''al-Andalus'' and the Christian ''Reconquista'' (8th&amp;ndash;15th centuries)==
{{main|Muslim conquests|Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Al-Andalus|Reconquista}}
[[File:Península ibérica 750.svg|225px|thumb|right|al-Andalus at its greatest extent, 720]]
The [[Arab Islamic conquest]] dominated most of North Africa by 640 AD. In 711 an Islamic  [[Berber people|Berber]] and Arab raiding party, led by [[Tariq ibn-Ziyad]], was sent to  Iberia to intervene in a civil war in the [[Visigothic Kingdom]]. Crossing the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], they won a decisive victory in the summer of 711 when the Visigothic [[Roderic|King Roderic]] was defeated and killed on July 19 at the [[Battle of Guadalete]]. Tariq's commander, [[Musa bin Nusair]], quickly crossed with reinforcements, and by 718 the [[Muslim]]s were in control of nearly the whole [[Iberian Peninsula]]. The advance into [[Western Europe]] was only stopped in what is now north-central France by the [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] [[Franks]] under [[Charles Martel]] at the [[Battle of Tours]] in 732.

A decisive victory for the Christian took place at Covadonga, in the north of the Iberian Peninsula, in the summer of 722. In a minor battle known as the [[Battle of Covadonga]], a Muslim force sent to put down the Christians rebels in the northern mountains was defeated by [[Pelagius of Asturias]], who established the monarchy of the Christian [[Kingdom of Asturias]]. In 739, a rebellion in Galicia, assisted by the Asturians, drove out Muslim forces and it joined the Asturian kingdom.  The Kingdom of Asturias became the main base for Christian resistance to Islamic rule in the Iberian Peninsula for several centuries.

[[Caliph]] [[Al-Walid I]] had paid great attention to the expansion of an organized military, building the strongest navy in the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] era (the second major Arab dynasty after Mohammad and the first Arab dynasty of [[Al-Andalus]]). It was this tactic that supported the ultimate expansion to Spain. Caliph Al-Walid I's reign is considered as the apex of Islamic power{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}, though Islamic power in Spain specifically climaxed in the 10th century under [[Abd-ar-Rahman III]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fletcher|first=Richard|title=Moorish Spain|year=2006|publisher=University of California Press|location=Los Angeles, California|isbn=0-520-24840-6|pages=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The rulers of [[Al-Andalus]] were granted the rank of [[Emir]] by the Umayyad Caliph Al-Walid I in [[Damascus]]. Emir [[Abd-ar-rahman I]] challenged the Abbasids. The Umayyad Caliphate, with origin in Hejaz, Arabian peninsula ''or Emirate'' was overthrown by the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] ''or Emirate'' (second Arab dynasty), some of the remaining Umayyad leaders escaped to Castile and declared Córdoba an independent emirate. Al-Andalus was rife with internal conflict between the Islamic Umayyad rulers and people and the Christian Visigoth-Roman leaders and people.

[[Image:506-Castile 1210.png|350px|thumb|The Christian kingdoms of Iberia and the Islamic Almohad empire c.1210]]
In the 10th century [[Abd-ar-rahman III]] – from Hejaz, Arabian peninsula, grandson of the last caliph of Damascus, Syria – declared the [[Caliphate of Córdoba]], effectively breaking all ties with the Egyptian and Syrian caliphs. The Caliphate was mostly concerned with maintaining its power base in North Africa, but these possessions eventually dwindled to the [[Ceuta]] province. The first navy of the [[Caliph of Córdoba]] ''or Emir'' was built after the humiliating [[Viking]] ascent of the [[Guadalquivir]] in 844 when they sacked [[Seville]].&lt;ref name=&quot;zum.de&quot;&gt;[http://www.zum.de/whkmla/timelines/wh/tlvikings.html Timelines - Vikings, Saracens, Magyars]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 942, pagan [[Magyars]] (present day Hungary) [[Hungarian invasions of Europe|raided across Europe]] as far west as Al-Andalus.&lt;ref name=&quot;zum.de&quot;/&gt; Meanwhile, a slow but steady migration of Christian subjects to the northern kingdoms in Christian Hispania was slowly increasing the latter's power. Even so, Al-Andalus remained vastly superior to all the northern kingdoms combined in population, economy and military might; and internal conflict between the Christian kingdoms contributed to keep them relatively harmless.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Al-Andalus coincided with ''[[La Convivencia]]'', an era of relative religious tolerance, and with the [[Golden age of Jewish culture in the Iberian Peninsula]]. (See: Emir [[Abd-ar-Rahman III]] 912; the [[1066 Granada massacre|Granada massacre]] 1066).&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=412&amp;letter=G&amp;search=Granada Granada] by Richard Gottheil, Meyer Kayserling, ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''. 1906 ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslim interest in the peninsula returned in force around the year 1000 when [[Al-Mansur (Abi Amir)|Al-Mansur]] (also known as ''Almanzor'') sacked Barcelona in 985. Under his son, other Christian cities were subjected to numerous raids.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libro.uca.edu/rc/rc1.htm Ransoming Captives in Crusader Spain: The Order of Merced on the Christian-Islamic Frontier]&lt;/ref&gt; After his son's death, the caliphate plunged into a civil war and splintered into the so-called &quot;[[Taifa]] Kingdoms&quot;. The Taifa kings competed against each other not only in war but also in the protection of the arts, and culture enjoyed a brief upswing. The Taifa kingdoms lost ground to the Christian realms in the north and, after the loss of Toledo in 1085, the Muslim rulers reluctantly invited the [[Almoravides]], who invaded Al-Andalus from North Africa and established an empire. In the 12th century the Almoravid empire broke up again, only to be taken over by the [[Almohad]] invasion, who were defeated by an alliance of the Christian kingdoms in the decisive [[battle of Las Navas de Tolosa]] in 1212. By 1250, nearly all of Iberia was back under Christian rule with the exception of the small Muslim kingdom of Granada.

[[Spain in the Middle Ages|Medieval Spain]] was the scene of almost constant warfare between Muslims and Christians. The Almohads, who had taken control of the Almoravids' Maghribi and al-Andalus territories by 1147, surpassed the Almoravides in fundamentalist Islamic outlook, and they treated the non-believer ''[[dhimmi]]s'' harshly. Faced with the choice of death, conversion, or emigration, many [[Jews]] and Christians left.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myjewishlearning.com/history_community/Medieval/IntergroupTO/JewishMuslim/Almohads.htm The Almohads]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Christian kingdoms to the North had also, at times, treated Muslims harshly. The treatment towards Jews at this time in Iberia varied greatly between and within the different Muslim and Christian kingdoms. By the mid-13th century [[Emirate of Granada]] was the only independent Muslim realm in Spain, which would last until 1492. Despite the decline in Muslim-controlled kingdoms, it is important to note the lasting effects exerted on the peninsula by Muslims in technology, culture, and society.

The Kings of Aragón ruled territories that consisted of not only the present administrative region of [[Aragon]] but also [[Catalonia]], and later the [[Balearic Islands]], [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencia]], [[Sicily]], [[Naples]] and [[Sardinia]] (see [[Crown of Aragon]]). Considered by most to have been the first [[mercenary]] company in Western Europe, the [[Catalan Company]] proceeded to occupy the [[Duchy of Athens]], which they placed under the protection of a prince of the House of Aragon and ruled until 1379.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~kuijt/dba165/dba165.html Catalan Company (1302-1388 AD)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Spanish language and universities===

In the 13th century, many languages were spoken in the Christian kingdoms of Iberia. These included the [[Latin language|Latin]] based [[Romance languages]] of [[Spanish language|Castilian]], [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Galician Language|Galician]], [[Aranese language|Aranese]], [[Asturian language|Asturian]] and [[Leonese language|Leonese]], and the ancient [[language isolate]] of [[Basque Language|Basque]]. Throughout the century, Castilian (what is also known today as Spanish) gained a growing prominence in the Kingdom of Castile as the language of culture and communication, at the expense of Leonese and of other close dialects. One example of this is the epic song ('cantar') written after the military leader ''[[El Cid]]''. In the last years of the reign of [[Ferdinand III of Castile]], Castilian began to be used for certain types of documents, and it was during the reign of [[Alfonso X of Castile|Alfonso X]] that it became the official language. Henceforth all public documents were written in Castilian; likewise all translations were made into Castilian instead of Latin.

At the same time, [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Galician language|Galician]] became the standard languages in their respective territories, developing important literary traditions and being the normal languages in which public and private documents were issued: Galician from the 13th to the 16th century in Galicia and nearby regions of Asturias and Leon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mariño Paz|first=Ramón|title=Historia da lingua galega|year=1998|publisher=Sotelo Blanco|location=Santiago de Compostela|isbn=84-7824-333-x|pages=182–194|edition=2. ed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Catalan from the 12th to the 18th century in Catalonia, the Balearic Islands and Valencia, where it was known as Valencian. Both languages were later substituted in its official status by Castillian Spanish, till the 20th century.

In the 13th century many universities were founded in León and in Castile. Some, such as the Leonese [[University of Salamanca|Salamanca]] and the Castilian Palencia, were among the earliest universities in Europe.

In 1492, under the [[Catholic Monarchs]], the first edition of the ''[[Grammar of the Castilian Language]]'' by [[Antonio de Nebrija]] was published.

==Early Modern Spain==

===Dynastic Union===
 [[Image:CastillaLeon 1360.png|thumb|350px|Iberian polities circa 1360.]]
In the 15th century, the most important among all of the separate Christian kingdoms that made up the old [[Hispania]] were the [[Kingdom of Castile]] (occupying northern and central portions of the Iberian Peninsula) the [[Kingdom of Aragon|Crown of Aragon]] (occupying northeastern portions of the peninsula) and the [[kingdom of Portugal]] occupying western iberian peninsula.  The rulers of the kingdoms  of Castille and Aragon were allied with dynastic families in Portugal, France, and other neighboring kingdoms.  

The death of King [[Henry IV of Castile]] in 1474 set off a struggle for power called the [[War of the Castilian Succession]] (1475-1479). Contenders for the throne of Castile were Henry's one-time heir [[Joanna La Beltraneja]], supported by Portugal and France, and Henry's half-sister Queen [[Isabella I of Castile]], supported by the Kingdom of Aragon and by the Castilian nobility.

Isabella retained the throne and ruled jointly with her husband, [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|King Ferdinand II]]. Isabella and Ferdinand had married in 1469&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Thomas, ''Rivers of Gold'' (Random House: New York, 2003) p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Valladolid]]. Their marriage united both crowns and set the stage for the creation of the [[Spain|Kingdom of Spain]], at the dawn of the modern era. That union, however, was a union in title only, as each region retained its own political and judicial structure, and even today Spain remains internally divided. Pursuant to an agreement signed by Isabella and Ferdinand on January 15, 1474,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hugh Thomas p. 21&quot;&gt;Hugh Thomas, ''Rivers of Gold'', p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Isabella held more authority over the newly unified Spain than her husband, although their rule was shared.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hugh Thomas p. 21&quot;/&gt; Together, Isabella of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and Ferdinand of [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] were known as the &quot;Catholic Monarchs&quot; ({{lang-es|los Reyes Católicos|links=no}}), a title bestowed on them by [[Pope Alexander VI]].

[[File:Old Spanish rug.jpg|thumb|200px|This 16th-century Spanish carpet shows stylistic influences from Europe and the [[Islamic art|Islamic]] world. Collections of the [[Textile Museum]].]]
The monarchs oversaw the final stages of the [[Reconquista]] of [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] territory from the [[Moors]] with the conquest of [[Granada]], conquered the [[Canary Islands]], and expelled the Jews and Muslims from Spain under the [[Alhambra decree]]. Although until the 13th century religious minorities (Jews and Muslims) had enjoyed considerable tolerance in Castilla and Aragon – the only Christian kingdoms where Jews were not restricted from any professional occupation – the situation of the Jews collapsed over the 14th century, reaching a climax in 1391 with large scale [[wiktionary:massacre|massacres]] in every major city except [[Ávila, Spain|Ávila]]. Over the next century, half of the estimated 200,000 [[Spanish Jews]] converted to Christianity (becoming &quot;[[conversos]]&quot;). The final step was taken by the Catholic Monarchs, who, in 1492, ordered the remaining Jews to convert or face expulsion from Spain. Depending on different sources, the number of Jews actually expelled is estimated to be anywhere from 40,000 to 120,000 people. Over the following decades, [[Muslims]] faced the same fate and about 60 years after the Jews, they were also compelled to convert (&quot;[[moriscos]]&quot;) or be expelled. However, sufficient numbers of [[moriscos]] stayed that Muslim culture remained influential in Spain. Jews and Muslims were not the only people to be persecuted during this time period. All [[Roma in Spain|Roma (Gypsy)]] males between the ages of 18 and 26 were forced to serve in [[galley]]s – which was equivalent to a death sentence – but the majority managed to hide and avoid arrest.

Isabella and Ferdinand authorized the 1492 expedition of [[Christopher Columbus]], who became the first known European to reach the [[New World]] since [[Leif Ericson]]. This and subsequent expeditions led to an influx of wealth into Spain, supplementing income from within Castile for the state that would prove to be a dominant power of Europe for the next two centuries.

Isabella ensured long-term political stability in Spain by arranging strategic marriages for each of her five children. Her firstborn, a daughter named [[Isabella of Asturias|Isabella]], married [[Afonso, Prince of Portugal|Afonso of Portugal]], forging important ties between these two neighboring countries and hopefully ensuring future alliance, but Isabella soon died before giving birth to an heir. [[Joanna of Castille|Juana]], Isabella's second daughter, married into the [[Habsburg dynasty]] when she wed [[Philip the Handsome]], the son of [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]], King of Bohemia (Austria) and entitled to the crown of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. This ensured an alliance with the Habsburgs and the [[Holy Roman Empire]], a powerful, far-reaching territory that assured Spain's future political security. Isabella's only son, [[Juan, Prince of Asturias|Juan]], married [[Margaret of Habsburg (1480–1530)|Margaret of Austria]], further maintaining ties with the Habsburg dynasty. Isabella's fourth child, [[Maria of Aragon (1482-1517)|Maria]], married [[Manuel I of Portugal]], strengthening the link forged by her older sister's marriage. Her fifth child, [[Catherine of Aragon|Catherine]], married King [[Henry VIII of England]] and was mother to Queen [[Mary I of England]].

===Imperial Spain===

{{main|Spanish Empire}}
{{see also|Habsburg Spain}}

The Spanish Empire was one of the first modern [[Global Empire|global empires]]. It was also one of the largest empires in world history.  In the 16th century, Spain and Portugal were in the vanguard of European global exploration and colonial expansion.  The two kingdoms on the conquest and Iberian Peninsula competed with each other in opening of trade routes across the oceans.  Spanish imperial conquest and colonization began with two Castilian expeditions.  The first was an expedition of a Castilian fleet led by a Genoese, [[Lanzarotto Malocello]].  The second was another expedition in 1402 led by French adventurers, [[Jean de Bethancourt]], Lord of Grainville in Normandy and [[Gadifer de la Salle of Poitou]].&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Thomas, ''Rivers of Gold'', p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the 15th and 16th centuries, trade flourished across the Atlantic between Spain and the Americas and across the Pacific between East Asia and [[Mexico]] via the [[Philippines]].  [[Conquistador]]s deposed the [[Aztec]], [[Inca Empire|Inca]] and [[Maya civilization|Maya]] governments with extensive help from local factions and laid claim to vast stretches of land in North and South America. 

[[Image:Columbus Taking Possession.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Christopher Columbus]] setting foot in the [[New World]], 1492.]] 
This American empire was at first a disappointment, as the natives had little to trade, though settlement did encourage trade.  Diseases such as [[smallpox]] and [[measles]] that arrived with the colonizers devastated the native populations, especially in the densely populated regions of the Aztec, Maya and Inca civilizations, and this reduced the economic potential of conquered areas.&lt;ref&gt;There is simply no consensus as to the extent, with estimates varying by many orders of magnitude, but that it occurred is not doubted - See [[Population history of American indigenous peoples]].&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1520s, large-scale extraction of silver from the rich deposits of Mexico's [[Guanajuato]] began to be greatly augmented by the  silver mines in Mexico's [[Zacatecas]] and Bolivia's [[Potosí]] from 1546. These silver shipments re-oriented the Spanish economy, leading to the importation of luxuries and grain. They also became indispensable in financing the military capability of [[Habsburg Spain]] in its long series of European and North African wars, though, with the exception of a few years in the 17th century, Spain itself (Castile in particular) was by far the most important source of revenue. 

Spain enjoyed a [[Spanish Golden Age|cultural golden age]] in the 16th and 17th centuries. For a time, the Spanish Empire dominated the oceans with its experienced [[Spanish navy|navy]] and ruled the European battlefield with its fearsome and well trained infantry, the famous ''{{lang|es|[[tercio]]s}}'', in the words of the prominent French historian [[Pierre Vilar]], &quot;enacting the most extraordinary epic in human history&quot;. 

The financial burden within the peninsula was on the backs of the peasant class while the nobility enjoyed an increasingly lavish lifestyle. From the time beginning with the incorporation of the [[Portuguese Empire]] in 1580 (lost in 1640) until the loss of its American colonies in the 19th century, Spain maintained the largest empire in the world even though it suffered fluctuating military and economic fortunes from the 1640s. 

Confronted by the new experiences, difficulties and suffering created by empire-building, Spanish thinkers formulated some of the first [[Modernity|modern]] thoughts on [[natural law]], [[sovereignty]], [[international law]], war, and [[economics]]; there were even questions about the legitimacy of [[imperialism]] – in related schools of thought referred to collectively as the [[School of Salamanca]].  Despite these innovations, many motives for the empire were rooted in the Middle Ages.  Religion played a very strong role in the spread of the Spanish empire.  The thought that Spain could bring Christianity to the new world certainly played a strong role in the expansion of Spain's empire.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

===Spanish Kingdoms under the Habsburgs (16th–17th centuries)===
{{main|Habsburg Spain}}

[[Image:Emperor charles v.png|thumb|250px|[[Charles I of Spain]] (better known in the English-speaking world at the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] Charles V) was the most powerful European monarch of his day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Renaissance and Reformation |last=Patrick |first=James |url=http://books.google.com/books?pg=PA207&amp;dq=charles+V+was+the+most+powerful+monarch+of+his+day&amp;id=i6ZJlLHLPY8C&amp;output=html |publisher=Marshall Cavendish |year=2007 |pages=207 |isbn=0-7614-7651-2, 9780761476511}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Spain's powerful world empire of the 16th and 17th centuries reached its height and declined under the [[Habsburgs]]. The [[Spanish Empire]] reached its maximum extent in Europe under [[Charles I of Spain]], as he was also Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

Charles V became king in 1516, and the history of Spain became even more firmly enmeshed with the dynastic struggles in Europe. The king was not often in Spain, and as he approached the end of his life he made provision for the division of the Habsburg inheritance into two parts. On the one hand was Spain, its possessions in the Mediterranean and overseas, and the Habsburg possessions in the Netherlands; on the other hand was the [[Holy Roman Empire]] itself. This was to prove a difficulty for his successor [[Philip II of Spain]].

Philip II became king on Charles V's abdication in 1556. Spain largely escaped the religious conflicts that were raging throughout the rest of Europe, and remained firmly Roman Catholic. Philip saw himself as a champion of Catholicism, both against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] and the [[Christian heresy|heretics]]. 

In the 1560s, plans to consolidate control of the Netherlands led to unrest, which gradually led to the [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] leadership of the revolt and the [[Eighty Years' War]]. This conflict consumed much Spanish expenditure during the later 16th century. Conflicts included an attempt to conquer England – a cautious supporter of the Dutch – in the unsuccessful [[Spanish Armada]], an early battle in the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585)|Anglo-Spanish War]] (1585–1604), and war with France (1590–1598).

Despite these problems, the growing inflow of American silver from mid-16th century, the justified military reputation of the Spanish infantry and even the navy quickly recovering from its Armada disaster, made Spain [[hegemony|the leading European power]], a novel situation of which its citizens were only just becoming aware. The [[Iberian Union]] with Portugal in 1580 not only unified the peninsula, but added that country's worldwide resources to the Spanish crown. 

However, economic and administrative problems multiplied in [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]], and the weakness of the native economy became evident in the following century. Rising [[price revolution|inflation]], financially draining wars in Europe, the ongoing aftermath of the expulsion of the Jews and Moors from Spain, and Spain's growing dependency on the gold and silver imports, combined to cause several bankruptcies that caused economic crisis in the country, especially in heavily burdened Castile.

[[Image:Europe map 1648.PNG|thumb|350px|A map of Europe in 1648, after the [[Peace of Westphalia]].]]
[[Barbary pirates]] from North Africa became an increasing problem. The coastal villages of Spain and of the [[Balearic Islands]] were frequently attacked. [[Formentera]] was even temporarily left by its population.  This occurred also along long stretches of the Spanish and Italian coasts, a relatively short distance across a calm sea from the pirates in their North African lairs. The most famous corsair was the Turkish [[Hayreddin Barbarossa|Barbarossa]] (&quot;Redbeard&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;researchnews.osu.edu&quot;&gt;[http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/whtslav.htm ''When Europeans were slaves: Research suggests white slavery was much more common than previously believed'']&lt;/ref&gt; According to Robert Davis between 1 million and 1.25 million Europeans were captured by North African pirates and sold as [[slavery|slaves]] in North Africa and [[Ottoman Empire]] between the 16th and 19th centuries. This was gradually alleviated as Spain and other Christian powers began to check Muslim naval dominance in the Mediterranean after the 1571 [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)|victory at Lepanto]], but it would be a scourge that continued to afflict the country even in the next century.&lt;ref name=&quot;researchnews.osu.edu&quot;/&gt;

The [[Great Plague of Seville|great plague]] of 1596&amp;ndash;1602 killed 600,000 to 700,000 people, or about 10% of the population. Altogether more than 1,250,000 deaths resulted from the extreme incidence of plague in 17th-century Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libro.uca.edu/payne1/payne15.htm The Seventeenth-Century Decline]&lt;/ref&gt; Economically, the plague destroyed the labor force as well as creating a psychological blow to an already problematic Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[[J.H. Elliott]], &quot;Imperial Spain: 1469&amp;ndash;1716&quot;, Penguin Books, 1970, p.298&lt;/ref&gt;

Philip II died in 1598, and was succeeded by his son [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]]. In his reign (1598–1621) a ten year truce with the Dutch was overshadowed in 1618 by Spain's involvement in the European-wide [[Thirty Years' War]]. Government policy was dominated by favorites, but it was also the reign in which the geniuses of [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]] and [[El Greco]] flourished.

Philip III was succeeded in 1621 by his son [[Philip IV of Spain]] (reigned 1621–1665). Much of the policy was conducted by the minister [[Gaspar de Guzmán, Count-Duke of Olivares]]. In 1640, with the war in central Europe having no clear winner except the French, both Portugal and [[Catalonia]] rebelled. Portugal was lost to the crown for good; in Italy and most of Catalonia, French forces were expelled and Catalonia's independence was suppressed

In the reign of Philip's [[Mental retardation|developmentally disabled]] son and successor [[Charles II of Spain|Charles II]] (1665–1700), Spain was essentially left leaderless and was gradually being reduced to a second-rank power.

The [[Habsburg]] dynasty became extinct in Spain with Charles II's death in 1700, and the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] ensued in which the other European powers tried to assume control of the Spanish monarchy. King [[Louis XIV of France]] eventually &quot;won&quot; the War of Spanish Succession, and control of Spain passed to the [[Bourbon dynasty]]. However, the peace deals that followed included relinquishing the right to unite the French and Spanish thrones and the partitioning of Spain's European empire.

===The Golden Age (''Siglo de Oro'')===
{{main|Spanish Golden Age}}
[[File:El Greco View of Toledo.jpg|thumb|250px|''[[View of Toledo]]'' by [[El Greco]], between 1596 and 1600.]]
The Spanish Golden Age (in Spanish, ''[[Siglo de Oro]]'') was a period of flourishing arts and letters in the [[Spanish Empire]] (now Spain and the Spanish-speaking countries of Latin America), coinciding with the political decline and fall of the [[Habsburg]]s ([[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]], [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]] and [[Charles II of Spain|Charles II]]). It is interesting to note how arts during the Golden Age flourished despite the decline of the empire in the 17th century. The last great writer of the age, Sor [[Juana Inés de la Cruz]], died in [[New Spain]] in 1695.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Thomas. ''The Golden Age: The Spanish Empire of Charles V'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Habsburgs]], both in Spain and Austria, were great patrons of art in their countries. ''[[El Escorial]]'', the great royal monastery built by King [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]], invited the attention of some of Europe's greatest architects and painters. [[Diego Velázquez]], regarded as one of the most influential painters of European history and a greatly respected artist in his own time, cultivated a relationship with King Philip IV and his chief minister, the [[Count-Duke of Olivares]], leaving us several portraits that demonstrate his style and skill. [[El Greco]], a respected Greek artist from the period, settled in Spain, and infused Spanish art with the styles of the Italian renaissance and helped create a uniquely Spanish style of painting. 

Some of Spain's greatest music is regarded as having been written in the period. Such composers as [[Tomás Luis de Victoria]], [[Luis de Milán]] and [[Alonso Lobo]] helped to shape [[Renaissance music]] and the styles of [[counterpoint]] and [[polychoral]] music, and their influence lasted far into the [[Baroque music|Baroque period]].

Spanish literature blossomed as well, most famously demonstrated in the work of [[Miguel de Cervantes]], the author of ''[[Don Quixote|Don Quixote de la Mancha]]''. Spain's most prolific playwright, [[Lope de Vega]], wrote possibly as many as one thousand plays over his lifetime, over four hundred of which survive to the present day.

[[Charles II of Spain|Charles II]], having no direct heir, was succeeded by his great-nephew [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], a French prince, in 1700. Concern among other European powers that Spain and France united under a single Bourbon monarch would upset the [[Balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] led to the [[War of Spanish Succession]] between 1701 and 1714. It pitted powerful France and weak Spain against the Grand Alliance of England, the Netherlands and Austria. After many battles, especially in Spain, the Grand Alliance finally won.&lt;ref&gt;John B.

[[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]] signed the [[Nueva Planta decrees|''Decreto de Nueva Planta'']] in 1715. This new law revoked most of the historical rights and privileges of the different kingdoms that formed the Spanish Crown, especially the [[Crown of Aragon]], unifying them under the laws of Castile, where the Castillian [[Cortes Generales]] had been more receptive to the royal wish.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Kamen, ''Philip V of Spain'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Spain became culturally and politically a follower of [[Absolutism (European history)|absolutist]] France. Lynch says Philip V advanced the government only marginally over that of his predecessors and was more of a liability than the incapacitated Charles II; when a conflict came up between the interests of Spain and France, he usually favored France.&lt;ref name=&quot;John Lynch 1989 pp 67- 115&quot;&gt;John Lynch, ''Bourbon Spain: 1700&amp;ndash;1808'' (1989) pp 67- 115&lt;/ref&gt; Philip made reforms in government, and strengthened the central authorities relative to the provinces. Merit became more important, although most senior positions still went to the landed aristocracy. Below the elite level, inefficiency and corruption was as widespread as ever. The reforms started by Philip V culminated in much more important reforms of Charles III.&lt;ref name=&quot;John Lynch 1989 pp 67- 115&quot;/&gt; The economy, on the whole, improved over the depressed 1650–1700 era, with greater productivity and fewer famines and epidemics.&lt;ref&gt;Earl J. Hamilton, &quot;Money and Economic Recovery in Spain under the First Bourbon, 1701&amp;ndash;1746&quot;, ''Journal of Modern History'' Vol. 15, No. 3 (Sep., 1943), pp. 192-206 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/1871302 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

The rule of the Spanish Bourbons continued under [[Ferdinand VI of Spain|Ferdinand VI]] (1746–1759) and [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] (1759–1788). [[Elisabeth of Parma]], Philip V's widow, exerted great influence on Spain's foreign policy. Her principal aim was to have Spain's lost territories in Italy restored. She eventually received Franco-British support for this after the [[Congress of Soissons]] (1728–1729).&lt;ref&gt;Simms p.211&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the rule of Charles III and his ministers – [[Leopoldo de Gregorio, Marquis of Esquilache]] and [[José Moñino y Redondo, conde de Floridablanca|José Moñino, Count of Floridablanca]] – Spain embarked on a program of [[enlightened despotism]] that brought Spain a new prosperity in the middle of the 18th century. Fearing that [[Great Britain in the Seven Years War|Britain's victory over France in the Seven Years War]] (1756–1763) threatened the [[European balance of power]], Spain allied themselves to France but suffered a series of military defeats and ended up having to cede [[Florida]] to the British at the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]], which ended the [[Seven Years' War]]. Spain later recouped most of those territorial losses with the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], which ended the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775–1783), and gained an improved international standing.

However, the reforming spirit of Charles III was extinguished in the reign of his son, [[Charles IV of Spain|Charles IV]] (1788 to abdication in 1808), seen by some as mentally handicapped. Dominated by his wife's lover, [[Manuel de Godoy]], Charles IV embarked on policies that overturned much of Charles III's reforms. After briefly opposing [[Revolutionary France]] early in the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], Spain was cajoled into an uneasy alliance with its northern neighbor, only to be [[blockade]]d by the British.  Charles IV's vacillation, culminating in his failure to honour the alliance by neglecting to enforce the [[Continental System]] led to [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon I]], Emperor of the French, invading Spain in 1808, thereby triggering Spain's [[Peninsular War|War of Independence]].

During most of the 18th century Spain had arrested its relative decline of the latter part of the 17th century. But despite the progress, it continued to lag in the political and mercantile developments then transforming other parts of Europe, most notably in Great Britain, the Low Countries, and France. The chaos unleashed by the Napoleonic intervention would cause this gap to widen greatly.

===War of Spanish Independence (1808&amp;ndash;1814)===

Spain initially sided against French in the [[Napoleonic Wars]], but the defeat of her army early in the war led to [[Charles IV of Spain|Charles IV]]'s pragmatic decision to align with the revolutionary French. Spain was put under a British blockade, and her colonies – for the first time separated from their colonial rulers – began to trade independently with Britain. The defeat of the [[British invasions of the Río de la Plata]] in South America (1806 and 1807) emboldened an independent attitude in Spain's American colonies. A major Franco-Spanish fleet was annihilated at the decisive [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805, prompting the vacillating king of Spain to reconsider his alliance with France. Spain temporarily broke off from the [[Continental System]], and Napoleon – aggravated with the Bourbon kings of Spain – [[invasion|invaded]] Spain in 1808 and deposed [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]], who had been on the throne only forty-eight days after his father's abdication in March 1808. On July 20, 1808, Joseph Bonaparte, eldest brother of Napoleon Bonaparte, entered Madrid and established a government by which he became King of Spain, serving as a surrogate for Napoleon.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, &quot;Revolutionary Spain&quot; contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 13'', p. 406.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Spanish monarchy may have been destroyed but the people of Spain vigorously resisted Napoleon's attempt to conquer his former ally.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, &quot;Revolutionary Spain&quot; contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 13'', pp. 396-399.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[junta (Peninsular War)|Juntas]]'' were formed all across Spain that pronounced themselves in favor of Ferdinand VII. On September 26, 1808, a Central Junta was formed in the town of [[Aranjuez]] to coordinate the nationwide struggle against the French.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, &quot;Revolutionary Spain&quot; contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 13'', p. 408.&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially, the Central Junta declared support for Ferdinand VII, and convened a &quot;[[Cortes Generales|General and Extraordinary Cortes]]&quot; for all the kingdoms of the Spanish Monarchy. On February 22 and 23, 1809, a popular insurrection against the French occupation broke out all over Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, &quot;Revolutionary Spain&quot; contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 13'', p. 417.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Cortes assembled on September 24, 1810, on the Isle of Leon.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, &quot;Revolutionary Spain&quot; contained in the ''Collected works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 13'', p. 424.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Cortes removed itself to [[Cádiz]] on February 20, 1811.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, &quot;Revolutionary Spain&quot; contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 13'', p. 424.&lt;/ref&gt;  On March 19, 1812, the [[Cádiz Cortes]] created the first modern Spanish constitution, the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812|Constitution of 1812]] (informally named ''La Pepa'').  This constitution provided for a separation of the powers of the executive and the legislative branches of government.  The Cortes was to be elected by universal suffrage, albeit by an indirect method.  Each member of the Cortes was to represent 70,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, &quot;Revolutionary Spain&quot; contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 13'', p. 425.&lt;/ref&gt;  Members of the Cortes were to meet in annual sessions.  King was prevented from either convening or proroguing the Cortes.  Members of the Cortes were to serve single two-year terms.  They could not serve consecutive terms; a member could serve a second term only by allowing someone else to serve a single intervening term in office.  

This attempt at the development of a modern constitutional government lasted from 1808 until 1814, and became known as the first bourgeois revolution in Spain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Karl Marx p. 391&quot;&gt;Karl Marx, &quot;Revolutionary Spain&quot; contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 13'', p. 391.&lt;/ref&gt; Leaders of the liberals or reformist forces during this revolution were [[Count of Floridablanca|Jose Menino, Count of Floridablanca]], [[Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos]] and [[Pedro Rodriguez, Conde de Campomanes]].&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, &quot;Revolutionary Spain&quot; contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 13'', pp. 409 and 432.&lt;/ref&gt;  Born in 1728, Floridablanca was eighty years of age at the time of the revolutionary outbreak in 1808.  He had served as Prime Minister under King Charles III of Spain from 1777 until 1792;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, Revolutionary Spain&quot; contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 13'', p. 409.&lt;/ref&gt; now he served as President of the Central Junta.&lt;ref&gt;See biographical note contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 13'', p. 734.&lt;/ref&gt;   However, he tended to be suspicious of the popular spontaneity.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, &quot;Revolutionary Spain&quot; contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 13'',&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, Floridablanca tended to prevent development of the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;See biographical note contained in the ''Collected works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 13'', p. 734.&lt;/ref&gt;  Born in 1744, Jovellanos was somewhat younger than Floridablanco.  A writer and follower of the philosophers of the Enlightenment tradition of the previous century, Jovellanos had served as Minister of Justice from 1797 to 1798 under King Charles IV of Spain.&lt;ref&gt;See biographical note contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 13'', p. 738.&lt;/ref&gt;  Now, Jovellanos commanded a substantial and influential group within the Central Junta.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, &quot;Revolutinary Spain&quot; contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 13, p. 410.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Jovellanos had been imprisoned by [[Manuel Godoy|Manuel de Godoy, Duke of Alcudia]], who had served as Prime Minister of Spain and virtually ran the country as a dictator from 1792 until 1798 and from 1801 until 1808.&lt;ref&gt;See biographical note contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 13'', p. 735.&lt;/ref&gt;  Accordingly, even Jovellanos tended to be somewhat overly cautious in his approach to the revolutionary upsurge that was sweeping Spain in 1808.

The Spanish Army tried to fight the French invasion in the traditional &quot;set-piece&quot; style of warfare.  They lost every battle they fought with the French.  After the disastrous battle of [[Battle of Ocana|Ocana]], fought on November 19, 1809, the Spanish Army confined itself to guerrilla warfare against the French.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, &quot;Revolutionary Spain&quot; contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 13'', p. 420.&lt;/ref&gt;  

However, it was the Spanish people, themselves, who really led the fight in guerrilla war against the French.  In this war, Spain was aided by the British and Portuguese, led by the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]].  The Duke of Wellington fought Napoleon's forces in the [[Peninsular War]], with [[Joseph Bonaparte]] ruling as Napoleon's surrogate king at Madrid.  The brutal war was one of the first [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla wars]] in modern Western history. French supply lines stretching across Spain were mauled repeatedly by Spanish guerrillas. The war in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] fluctuated repeatedly, with Wellington spending several years behind his fortresses in Portugal while launching occasional campaigns into Spain. 

The French were decisively defeated at the [[Battle of Vitoria]] in 1813, and the following year, Ferdinand VII was restored as King of Spain.

===Reaction and change (1814&amp;ndash;1873)===
{{main|Mid-nineteenth century Spain}}
Although the ''juntas'', that had forced the French to leave Spain, had sworn by the liberal [[Constitution of 1812]], [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] openly believed that it was too liberal for the country. On his return to Spain on April 16, 1814,&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, &quot;Revolutionary Spain&quot; contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 13'', 436.&lt;/ref&gt; he refused to swear by the constitution himself, and he continued to rule in the authoritarian fashion of his forebears.&lt;ref&gt;Charles S. Esdaile, ''Spain in the Liberal Age: From Constitution to Civil War, 1808&amp;ndash;1939'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, the first bourgeois revolution ended in 1814.&lt;ref name=&quot;Karl Marx p. 391&quot;/&gt;

This rejection of the Constitution had far-reaching consequences. The Constitution of 1812 had eliminated all discrimination in the American colonies between Spaniards who were born in Spain and Spanish citizens who happened to be born in the colonies of New Spain.  Consequently, although Spain itself accepted the rejection of the Constitution, the rejection of the Constitution was not as calmly accepted in Spain's empire in the [[New World]]. Revolution broke out in the colonies of &quot;New Spain&quot; in the Americas in 1820.  Spain, nearly bankrupt from the war with France and the reconstruction of the country, was unable to pay her soldiers, and in 1819 was forced to sell Florida to the United States for 5 million dollars. In 1820, an expedition intended for the colonies (which, at the time, were on the verge of being lost themselves, to rebels and the [[Monroe Doctrine]]) revolted in [[Cadiz]]. When armies throughout Spain pronounced themselves in sympathy with the revolters, led by [[Rafael del Riego]], Ferdinand relented and was forced to accept the liberal Constitution of 1812.  This was the start of the second bourgeois revolution in Spain, which would last from 1820 to 1823.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, &quot;Revolutionary Spain&quot; contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 13'', p. 442.&lt;/ref&gt;  Once again in the revolution of 1820, it was the independent towns that led the drive for constitutional change in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, &quot;An Unpublished Abstract from a Series of Articles called Revolutionary Spain&quot; contained in the &quot;Preparatory Materials&quot; section of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 13'', p. 657.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ferdinand himself was placed under effective house arrest for the duration of the liberal experiment.

The tumultuous [[Trienio liberal|three years]] of liberal rule that followed (1820–1823) were marked by various absolutist conspiracies. The liberal government, which reminded European statesmen entirely too much of the governments of the [[French Revolution]], was viewed with hostility by the [[Congress of Verona]] in 1822, and France was authorized to intervene. France crushed the liberal government with massive force in the so-called &quot;[[Hundred Thousand Sons of Saint Louis]]&quot; expedition, and Ferdinand was restored as absolute monarch in 1823. In Spain proper, this marked the end of the second Spanish bourgeois revolution.  In the American colonies of New Spain, however, revolutions led to independence.  In 1824, the last Spanish army on the American mainland was defeated at the [[Battle of Ayacucho]] in southern [[Peru]]. Only Cuba and Puerto Rico remained.

In Spain, the failure of the second bourgeois revolution was followed by a period of uneasy peace for the next decade. Having borne only a female heir presumptive, it appeared that Ferdinand would be succeeded by his brother, [[Infante Carlos, Count of Molina|Infante Carlos of Spain]]. While Ferdinand aligned with the conservatives, fearing another national insurrection, he did not view the Carlos's reactionary policies as a viable option. Ferdinand – resisting the wishes of his brother – decreed the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1830]], enabling his daughter Isabella to become Queen.  Carlos, who made known his intent to resist the sanction, fled to Portugal.

Ferdinand's death in 1833 and the accession of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II as Queen of Spain]] sparked the [[First Carlist War]] (1833–1839).  Isabella was only three years old at the time so her mother, [[Maria Cristina of Bourbon-Two Sicilies]], was named [[regent]] until her daughter came of age. Carlos invaded the Basque country in the north of Spain and attracted support from absolutist reactionaries and conservatives; these forces were known as the &quot;Carlist&quot; forces.  The supporters of reform and of limitations on the absolutist rule of the Spanish throne rallied behind Isabella and the regent, Maria Christina; these reformists were called &quot;Cristinos.&quot; Though Cristino resistance to the insurrection seemed to have been overcome by the end of 1833, Maria Cristina's forces suddenly drove the Carlist armies from most of the Basque country. Carlos then appointed the [[Basque people|Basque]] general [[Tomás de Zumalacárregui]] as his [[commander-in-chief]]. Zumalacárregui resuscitated the Carlist cause, and by 1835 had driven the Cristino armies to the [[Ebro River]] and transformed the Carlist army from a demoralized band into a professional army of 30,000 of superior quality to the government forces. Zumalacárregui's death in 1835 changed the Carlists' fortunes. The Cristinos found a capable general in [[Baldomero Espartero]]. His victory at the [[Battle of Luchana]] (1836) turned the tide of the war, and in 1839, the [[Convention of Vergara]] put an end to the first Carlist insurrection.  The period of time from 1834 until 1843 is known as Spain's third bourgeois revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, &quot;Revolutionary Spain&quot; contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 13'', p. 391&lt;/ref&gt; 

Espartero, operating on his popularity as a [[war hero]] and his sobriquet &quot;Pacifier of Spain&quot;, demanded liberal reforms from Maria Cristina. The Queen Regent, who resisted any such idea, preferred to resign and let Espartero become regent instead in 1840. Espartero's liberal reforms were then opposed by moderates, and the former general's heavy-handedness caused a series of sporadic uprisings throughout the country from various quarters, all of which were bloodily suppressed. He was overthrown as regent in 1843 by [[Ramón María Narváez]], a moderate, who was in turn perceived as too reactionary. Another Carlist uprising, the [[Matiners' War]], was launched in 1846 in [[Catalonia]], but it was poorly organized and suppressed by 1849.

[[Isabella II of Spain]] took a more active role in government after coming of age, but she was immensely unpopular throughout her reign (1833–1868). She was viewed as beholden to whoever was closest to her at court, and the people of Spain believed that she cared little for them. As a result, there was a fourth bourgeois revolutionary insurrection in 1854.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, &quot;The Insurrection at Madrid--The Austro-Turkish Treaty--Moldavia and Wallachia&quot; contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 13'', p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;  This uprising began in the spring of 1854 as expressions of dissatisfaction on the part of the people against the government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frederick Engels p. 694&quot;&gt;See note 193 contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 13'', p. 694.&lt;/ref&gt;   The people were protesting the growing economic hardship under which they had been suffering.  On June 28, 1854, a military coup occurred in Madrid,&lt;ref name=&quot;Frederick Engels p. 694&quot;/&gt; led by General [[Domingo Dulce]] y Garay and General [[Leopoldo O'Donnell]] y Jarris.  Their coup overthrew the dictatorship of [[Luis Sartorius|Luis Jose Sartorius]], 1st Count of San Luis.  As the result of the popular insurrection, the ''[[Progressive Party (Spain)|Partido Progresista]]'' (Progressive Party) obtained widespread support in Spain and came to power in the government in 1854.&lt;ref&gt;See note 193 contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 13'', 694.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1856, Isabella attempted to form the [[Union Liberal Party]], a pan-national coalition under the leadership of [[Leopoldo O'Donnell]], who had already marched on Madrid that year and deposed another Espartero ministry. Isabella's plan failed and cost Isabella more prestige and favor with the people.  In 1860, Isabella launched a successful [[Spanish-Moroccan War (1859)|war]] against [[Morocco]], waged by generals O'Donnell and [[Juan Prim]] that stabilized her popularity in Spain.  However, a campaign to reconquer [[Peru]] and [[Chile]] during the [[Chincha Islands War]] (1864–1866) proved disastrous and Spain suffered defeat before the determined South American powers.

In 1866, a revolt led by [[Juan Prim]] was suppressed, but in 1868 there was a further revolt, known as the [[Glorious Revolution (Spain)|Glorious Revolution]]. The ''[[progresista]]'' generals [[Francisco Serrano y Dominguez|Francisco Serrano]] and [[Juan Prim]] revolted against Isabella and defeated her ''[[moderado]]'' generals at the [[Battle of Alcolea (1868)]]. Isabella was driven into exile in Paris.

Two years of revolution and anarchy followed, until in 1870 the Cortes declared that Spain would again have a king. [[Amadeus I of Spain|Amadeus of Savoy]], the second son of King [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy]], was selected and duly crowned [[King of Spain]] early the following year. This selection of the King of Spain turned out to play an important role in European and world history, since France opposed a [[Leopold, Prince of Hohenzollern|German prince's]] candidacy to the Spanish throne, and this served as the immediate motive for the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (1870–1871). Amadeus – a liberal who swore by the liberal constitution the Cortes promulgated – was faced immediately with the incredible task of bringing the disparate political ideologies of Spain to one table. The country was plagued by internecine strife, not merely between Spaniards but within Spanish parties.

===First Spanish Republic (1873&amp;ndash;1874)===
{{main|First Spanish Republic}}

Following the [[Hidalgo affair]] and an army rebellion, Amadeus famously declared the people of Spain to be ungovernable, abdicated the throne, and left the country (11 February 1873).

In his absence, a government of radicals and Republicans was formed that declared Spain a republic. The [[First Spanish Republic]] (1873–1874) was immediately under siege from all quarters. The [[Carlist]]s were the most immediate threat, launching a violent insurrection after their poor showing in the 1872 elections. There were calls for socialist revolution from the [[International Workingmen's Association]], revolts and unrest in the autonomous regions of [[Navarre]] and [[Catalonia]], and pressure from the Catholic Church against the fledgling republic.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph A. Brandt, ''Toward the New Spain: The Spanish Revolution of 1868 and the First Republic'' (1977)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Restoration (1874&amp;ndash;1931)===
{{main|Spain under the Restoration}}

Although the former [[Queen regnant|queen]], [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] was still alive, she recognized that she was too divisive as a leader, and abdicated in 1870 in favor of her son, Alfonso.

[[Alfonso XII of Spain]] was duly crowned on 28 December 1874 after returning from exile. After the tumult of the [[First Spanish Republic]], Spaniards were willing to accept a return to stability under [[Bourbon dynasty|Bourbon]] rule. The Republican armies in Spain &amp;mdash; which were resisting a [[Carlism|Carlist]] [[Third Carlist War|insurrection]] &amp;mdash; pronounced their allegiance to Alfonso in the winter of 1874&amp;ndash;1875, led by [[Brigadier General]] [[Arsenio Martínez-Campos y Antón|Martínez-Campos]]. The Republic was dissolved and [[Antonio Cánovas del Castillo]], a trusted advisor to the king, was named [[President of the Government of Spain|Prime Minister]] on [[New Year's Eve]], 1874. The Carlist insurrection was put down vigorously by the new king, who took an active role in the war and rapidly gained the support of most of his countrymen.&lt;ref&gt;Earl Ray Beck, ''Time of Triumph &amp; Sorrow: Spanish Politics during the Reign of Alfonso XII, 1874&amp;ndash;1885'' (1979)&lt;/ref&gt; A system of ''[[turnos]]'' was established in Spain in which the [[liberalism|liberals]], led by [[Práxedes Mateo Sagasta]] and the [[conservatism|conservatives]], led by Antonio Cánovas del Castillo, alternated in control of the government. A modicum of stability and economic progress was restored to Spain during Alfonso XII's rule (1874–1885), although progress was cut short by his sudden death at age 28. 

Constitutional monarchy continued under King [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|Alfonso XIII]].&lt;ref&gt;Beck, ''Time of Triumph &amp; Sorrow: Spanish Politics during the Reign of Alfonso XII, 1874&amp;ndash;1885'' (1979)&lt;/ref&gt; Alfonso XIII was born after his father's death and was proclaimed king upon his birth. However, the government had become destabilized by Alfonso XII's unexpected death in 1885, followed by the assassination of prime minister [[Antonio Cánovas del Castillo]] in 1897. The reign of Alfonso XIII (1886–1931) saw the [[Spanish-American War]] of 1898, culminating in the loss of the Philippines plus Spain's last colonies in the Americas, [[Cuba]] and [[Puerto Rico]]; the &quot;Great War&quot; in Europe (now known as [[World War I]], 1914–1918), although Spain maintained neutrality throughout the conflict; the influenza pandemic nicknamed the [[1918 flu pandemic|Spanish Flu]] (1918–1919); and the [[Rif War]] in Morocco (1920–1926). His reign also saw the rise to dictatorship of General [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]], who seized control of the government by military coup in 1923 and ruled as a dictator – with the monarch's support – for seven years (1923–1930). The world-wide recession, marked first by the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], caused deepening economic hardships in Spain and the resignation of Primo de Rivera's government in 1930. [[Spanish general election, 1931|General elections were held in 1931]] to replace the government, with Republican and anticlerical candidates winning the majority of votes. Alfonso XIII left the country in response to the proclamation of the [[Second Spanish Republic]], although he never abdicated.

===Disaster of 1898===
[[Cuba]] rebelled against Spain in the [[Ten Years' War]] beginning in 1868, resulting in the [[abolition of slavery]] in Spain's colonies in the [[New World]]. American interests in the island, coupled with concerns for the people of Cuba, aggravated relations between the two countries. The explosion of the {{USS|Maine|ACR-1|6}} launched the [[Spanish-American War]] in 1898, in which Spain fared disastrously. Cuba gained its independence and Spain lost its remaining New World colony, [[Puerto Rico]], which together with [[Guam]] and the [[Philippines]] were ceded to the United States for 20 million dollars. In 1899, Spain sold its remaining Pacific islands&amp;mdash;the [[Northern Mariana Islands]], [[Caroline Islands]] and [[Palau]]&amp;mdash;to Germany and Spanish colonial possessions were reduced to [[Spanish Morocco]], [[Spanish Sahara]] and [[Spanish Guinea]], all in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;John L. Offner, ''Unwanted War: The Diplomacy of the United States &amp; Spain over Cuba, 1895&amp;ndash;1898'' (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;disaster&quot; of 1898 created the [[Generation of '98]], a group of statesmen and intellectuals who demanded liberal change from the new government. However both [[Anarchism]] on the left and [[fascism]] on the right grew rapidly in Spain in the early 20th century. A revolt in 1909 in [[Catalonia]] was bloodily suppressed.&lt;ref&gt;H. Ramsden, &quot;The Spanish 'Generation of 1898': The History of a Concept&quot;, ''Bulletin of the John Rylands University Library of Manchester'', 1974, Vol. 56 Issue 2, pp 443-462&lt;/ref&gt;  Jensen (1999) argues that the defeat of 1898 led many military officers to abandon the liberalism that had been strong in the officer corps and turn to the right.  They interpreted the American victory in 1898 as well as the Japanese victory against Russia in 1905 as proof of the superior value of willpower and moral values over technology. Over the next three decades, Jensen argues, these values shaped the outlook of  [[Francisco Franco]] and other Falangists.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Jensen, &quot;Moral Strength Through Material Defeat? The Consequences of 1898 for Spanish Military Culture&quot;, ''War &amp; Society, Oct 1999, Vol. 17 Issue 2, pp 25-39&lt;/ref&gt;

==The 20th century==

===World War I===
Spain's neutrality in World War I allowed it to become a supplier of material for both sides to its great advantage, prompting an economic boom in Spain. The outbreak of [[Spanish influenza]] in Spain and elsewhere, along with a major economic slowdown in the postwar period, hit Spain particularly hard, and the country went into debt. A major worker's strike was suppressed in 1919.

Mistreatment of the indigenous population in [[Spanish Morocco]] led to an uprising and the loss of this North African possession except for the enclaves of [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]] in 1921. (See [[Muhammad Ibn 'Abd al-Karim al-Khattabi]], [[Annual, Morocco|Annual]]). In order to avoid accountability, King [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|Alfonso XIII]] decided to support the dictatorship of General [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]], ending the period of constitutional monarchy in Spain.

In joint action with France, the Moroccan territory was recovered (1925&amp;ndash;1927), but in 1930 bankruptcy and massive unpopularity left the king no option but to force Primo de Rivera to resign. Disgusted with the king's involvement in his dictatorship, the urban population voted for republican parties in the municipal elections of April 1931. The king fled the country without abdicating and a republic was established.

===Second Spanish Republic (1931&amp;ndash;1939)===
{{main|Second Spanish Republic}}
{{see also|Catholicism in the Second Spanish Republic}}

Under the Second Spanish Republic, [[Women's suffrage|women were allowed to vote]] in general elections for the first time. The Republic devolved substantial autonomy to the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] and to [[Catalonia]].

The first governments of the Republic were center-left, headed by [[Niceto Alcalá-Zamora]] and [[Manuel Azaña]]. Economic turmoil, substantial debt inherited from the [[Miguel Primo de Rivera|Primo de Rivera]] regime, and fractious, rapidly changing governing coalitions led to serious political unrest. 

In 1933, the [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] [[Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right]] (CEDA) won power, An armed rising of workers in October 1934, which reached its greatest intensity in [[Asturias]] and [[Catalonia]], was forcefully put down by the CEDA government. This in turn energized political movements across the spectrum in Spain, including a revived [[anarchism|anarchist]] movement and new [[reactionary]] and [[fascist]] groups, including the [[Falange]] and a revived [[Carlism|Carlist]] movement.

===Spanish Civil War (1936&amp;ndash;1939)===
{{main|Spanish Civil War}}

In the 1930s, Spanish politics were [[polarization (politics)|polarized]] at the left and right of the [[political spectrum]]. The left-wing favored [[class struggle]], [[land reform]],  autonomy to the regions and reduction in church and monarchist power. The right-wing groups, the largest of which was CEDA, a right wing [[Roman Catholic]] coalition, held opposing views on most issues. In 1936, the left united in the [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] and was elected to power. However, this coalition, dominated by the centre-left, was undermined both by the revolutionary groups such as the [[anarchist]] [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (CNT) and [[Federación Anarquista Ibérica]] (FAI) and by anti-democratic far-right groups such as the [[Falange]] and the [[Carlists]]. The political violence of previous years began to start again. There were gunfights over strikes, landless labourers began to seize land, church officials were killed and churches burnt. On the other side, right wing militias (such as the Falange) and gunmen hired by employers assassinated left wing activists. The Republican democracy never generated the consensus or mutual trust between the various political groups that it needed to function peacefully. As a result, the country slid into civil war. The right wing of the country and high ranking figures in the army began to plan a [[coup]], and when Falangist politician [[José Calvo-Sotelo]] was shot by Republican police, they used it as a signal to act.&lt;ref&gt;Antony Beevor, ''The Battle for Spain: The Spanish Civil War 1936&amp;ndash;1939'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 July 1936, General [[Francisco Franco]] led the colonial army from [[Morocco]] to attack the mainland, while another force from the north under General Sanjurjo moved south from [[Navarre]]. Military units were also mobilised elsewhere to take over government institutions. Franco's move was intended to seize power immediately, but successful resistance by Republicans in places such as Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, the Basque country and elsewhere meant that Spain faced a prolonged civil war. Before long, much of the south and west was under the control of the Nationalists, whose [[regular army|regular]] [[Spanish Army of Africa|Army of Africa]] was the most professional force available to either side. Both sides received foreign military aid: the Nationalists from [[Nazi Germany]], [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Fascist Italy]], and Portugal, while the Republic was supported by organised far-left volunteers in the [[International Brigades]].

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H25224, Guernica, Ruinen.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Ruins of [[Guernica (town)|Guernica]].]]
The [[Siege of the Alcázar]] at [[Toledo (Spain)|Toledo]] early in the war was a turning point, with the Nationalists winning after a long siege. The Republicans managed to [[Siege of Madrid|hold out in Madrid]], despite a Nationalist assault in November 1936, and frustrated subsequent offensives against the capital at [[battle of Jarama|Jarama]] and [[battle of Guadalajara|Guadalajara]] in 1937. Soon, though, the Nationalists began to erode their territory, starving Madrid and making inroads into the east. The north, including the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque country]] fell in late 1937 and the Aragon front collapsed shortly afterwards. The [[bombing of Guernica]] on the afternoon of 26 April 1937 – a mission used as a testing ground for the German [[Luftwaffe]]'s [[Condor Legion]] – was probably the most infamous event of the war and inspired [[Guernica (painting)|Picasso's painting]]. The [[Battle of the Ebro]] in July–November 1938 was the final desperate attempt by the Republicans to turn the tide. When this failed and [[Barcelona]] fell to the Nationalists in early 1939, it was clear the war was over. The remaining Republican fronts collapsed and Madrid fell in March 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Preston, ''The Spanish Civil War: Reaction, Revolution, and Revenge'' (2nd ed. 2007) pp 266-300&lt;/ref&gt;

The war, which cost between 300,000 to 1,000,000 lives, ended with the destruction of the Republic and the accession of Francisco Franco as dictator of Spain. Franco amalgamated all the right wing parties into a reconstituted fascist party [[Falange]] and banned the left-wing and Republican [[political party|parties]] and [[trade unions]].&lt;ref&gt;Preston, ''The Spanish Civil War: Reaction, Revolution, and Revenge'' (2007) pp 301-318&lt;/ref&gt;

The conduct of the war was brutal on both sides, with widespread massacres of civilians and prisoners. After the war, many thousands of Republicans were imprisoned and up to 151,000 were executed between 1939 and 1943. Many other Republicans remained in exile for the entire Franco period.

===The dictatorship of Francisco Franco (1936&amp;ndash;1975)===
{{main|Francoist Spain}}

During [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s rule, Spain was officially [[Spain in World War II|neutral in World War II]] and remained largely economically and culturally isolated from the outside world. Under a fascist military dictatorship, Spain saw its political parties banned, except for the official party (Falange). Labor unions were banned and all political activity using violence or intimidation to achieve its goals was forbidden.

Under Franco, Spain actively sought the return of [[Gibraltar]] by the UK, and gained some support for its cause at the [[United Nations]]. During the 1960s, Spain began imposing restrictions on Gibraltar, culminating in the closure of the border in 1969. It was not fully reopened until 1985.

Spanish rule in [[Morocco]] ended in 1967. Though militarily victorious in the 1957&amp;ndash;1958 [[Ifni War|Moroccan invasion of Spanish West Africa]], Spain gradually relinquished its remaining African colonies. Spanish Guinea was granted independence as [[Equatorial Guinea]] in 1968, while the Moroccan enclave of [[Ifni]] had been ceded to Morocco in 1969.

The latter years of Franco's rule saw some economic and political liberalization, the [[Spanish Miracle]], including the birth of a tourism industry. Spain began to catch up economically with its European neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley G. Payne, ''Franco and Hitler: Spain, Germany, and World War II'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Franco ruled until his death on 20 November 1975, when control was given to [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|King Juan Carlos]].&lt;ref&gt;Jean Grugel and Tim Rees, ''Franco's Spain'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; In the last few months before Franco's death, the Spanish state went into a paralysis. This was capitalized upon by King [[Hassan II of Morocco]], who ordered the '[[Green March]]' into [[Western Sahara]], Spain's last colonial possession.

===Transition to democracy===
{{main|Spanish transition to democracy}}

The Spanish transition to democracy or new Bourbon restoration was the era when Spain moved from the dictatorship of Francisco Franco to a liberal democratic state. The transition is usually said to have begun with Franco's death on 20 November 1975, while its completion is marked by the electoral victory of the socialist PSOE on 28 October 1982.

Between 1978 and 1982, Spain was led by the ''Unión del Centro Democrático'' governments.

In 1981 the [[23-F]] coup d'état attempt took place. On 23 February [[Antonio Tejero]], with members of the [[Guardia Civil (Spain)|Guardia Civil]] entered the Congress of Deputies, and stopped the session, where [[Leopoldo Calvo Sotelo]] was about to be named prime minister of the government. Officially, the [[coup d'état]] failed thanks to the intervention of King [[Juan Carlos of Spain|Juan Carlos]]. Spain joined [[NATO]] before Calvo-Sotelo left office.

Along with political change came [[Spanish society after the democratic transition|radical change in Spanish society]].  Spanish society had been extremely conservative under Franco, but the transition to democracy also began a liberalization of values and societal mores.

===Modern Spain===
{{main|Modern Spain}}

From 1982 until 1996, the social democratic PSOE governed the country, with [[Felipe González]] as prime minister. In 1986, Spain [[Accession of Spain to the European Union|joined the European Economic Community]] (EEC, now [[European Union]]), and the country hosted the [[1992 Barcelona Olympics]] and [[Seville Expo '92]].

In 1996, the centre-right ''Partido Popular'' government came to power, led by [[José María Aznar]]. On 1 January 1999, Spain exchanged the ''[[Spanish peseta|peseta]]'' for the new [[Euro]] currency. The peseta continued to be used for cash transactions until January 1, 2002. On 11 March 2004 a number of [[March 11, 2004 Madrid attacks|terrorist bombs exploded on busy commuter trains in Madrid]] during the morning rush-hour days before the general election, killing 191 persons and injuring thousands. [citation required] Although [[José María Aznar]] and his ministers were quick to accuse [[ETA]] of the atrocity, soon afterwards it became apparent that the bombing was the work of an extremist [[Islamic]] group linked to [[Al-Qaeda]]. Many people believe that the fact that qualified commentators abroad were beginning to doubt the official Spanish version the very same day of the attacks while the government insisted on ETA's implication directly influenced the results of the election. Opinion polls at the time show that the difference between the two main contenders had been too close to make any accurate prediction as to the outcome of the elections. The election, held three days after the attacks, was won by the PSOE, and [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]] replaced Aznar as prime minister.

On 3 July 2005, the country became the first country in the world to give full marriage and adoption rights to homosexual couples (Belgium [[Same-sex marriage in Belgium|has allowed same-sex marriage]] since 2003 and co-parenting since April 2006, and the Netherlands [[Same-sex marriage in the Netherlands|has allowed same-sex marriage]] since 2001 and now has a law in preparation to provide full adoption rights in equal conditions to opposite-sex marriages).

At present, Spain is a [[constitutional monarchy]]. It comprises 17 [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous communities]] ([[Andalusia]], [[Aragon]], [[Asturias]], [[Balearic Islands]], [[Canary Islands]], [[Cantabria]], [[Castile and León]], [[Castile–La Mancha]], [[Catalonia]], [[Extremadura]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]], [[Community of Madrid]], [[Region of Murcia]], [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], [[Valencian Community]], [[Navarre]]) and 2 autonomous cities ([[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]]).
