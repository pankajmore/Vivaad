[[File:ElSalvadorfairtradecoffee.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[economics of coffee|coffee trade]] is a worldwide industry]]

'''Economic geography''' is the study of the location, distribution and spatial organization of economic activities across the world.

Historically and generally, Economic Geography is regarded as a subfield of the discipline of [[geography]], although during the last decades many economists have pursued interests that can be considered part of economic geography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Gordon L. Clark, Maryann P. Feldman, and Meric S. Gertler|title=The Oxford Handbook of Economic Geography|isbn=978-0-19-823410-4|publisher=Oxford University Press}} Scroll to chapter-preview [http://books.google.com/books?id=TzZ_oByXYhkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Economic+geography%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=x1w8qTXGfi&amp;sig=DTOZmshfo7muaRIt3ifaAT8Fj5E&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=MEWeS9f5JYP68Aa5g4S7Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false links.]&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this fact, many believe that Economic Geography is part of the discipline of Economics, instead of Geography.  

Given the variety of approaches, Economic Geography has taken to many different subject matters, including: the location of industries, [[economies of agglomeration]] (also known as &quot;linkages&quot;), [[Transportation geography|transportation]], [[international trade]], economic development, real estate, [[gentrification]], ethnic economies, gendered economies, [[core-periphery]] theory, the [[urban economics|economics of urban form]], the relationship between the environment and the economy (tying into a long history of geographers studying culture-environment interaction), and [[globalization]].  This list is by no means exhaustive.

== Theoretical background and influences ==
The subject matter investigated is strongly influenced by the researcher's methodological approach.  Neoclassical [[location theory|location theorists]], following in the tradition of [[Alfred Weber]], tend to focus on industrial location and use quantitative methods.  Since the 1970s, two broad reactions against neoclassical approaches have significantly changed the discipline: Marxist political economy, growing out of the work of [[David Harvey (social theorist and geographer)|David Harvey]]; and the new economic geography which takes into account social, cultural, and institutional factors in the spatial economy.

Economists such as [[Paul Krugman]] and [[Jeffrey Sachs]] have also analyzed many traits related to economic geography. Krugman has gone so far as to call his application of spatial thinking to [[international trade theory]] the &quot;new economic geography&quot;, which directly competes with an approach within the discipline of geography that is also called &quot;new economic geography&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;From S.N.

==Approaches to study==
As the economic geography is a very broad discipline with economic geographers using many different methodologies in the study of economic phenomena in the world some distinct approaches to study have evolved over time:
*''Theoretical economic Geography'' focuses on building theories about spatial arrangement and distribution of economic activities.
*''[[Regional geography|Regional]] economic geography'' examines the economic conditions of particular regions or countries of the world. It deals with economic [[regionalization]], and local [[Economic growth|economic development]] as well.
*''[[Historical geography|Historical]] economic geography'' examines history and the development of spatial economic structure. Using historical data it examines how the centers of population and economic activity shift, what patterns of regional specialization and localization evolved over time and what factors explain these changes.
*''[[Critical geography|Critical]] economic geography'' is approach from the point of view of contemporary [[critical geography]] and its philosophy.
*''[[Behavioral geography|Behavioral]] economic geography'' which examines the cognitive processes underlying spatial reasoning, locational decision making, and behavior of firms&lt;ref&gt;Schoenberger, E. (2001): ''Corporate autobiographies: the narrative strategies of corporate strategists''. Journal of Economic Geography 1, 277-98.&lt;/ref&gt; and individuals.
*''...''
Economic geography is a branch of anthropo-geography that focuses on regional systems of human economic activity. An alternative description of different approaches to the study of human economic activity can be organized around spatiotemporal analysis, analysis of production/consumption of economic items, and analysis of economic flow. Spatiotemporal systems of analysis include economic activities of region, mixed social spaces, and development. Alternatively, analysis can focus on production, exchange, distribution and consumption of items of economic activity. Allowing parameters of space-time and item to vary, a geographer may also examine material flow, commodity flow, population flow and information flow from different parts of the economic activity system. Through analysis of flow and production, industrial areas, rural and urban residential areas, transportation site, commercial service facilities and finance and other economic centers are linked together in an economic activity system.

==Branches==
Thematically, economic geography can be divided into these subdisciplines:
* Geography of Agriculture
* Geography of Industry
* Geography of International Trade
* Geography of Resources
* [[Transportation geography|Geography of Transport]] and Communication
* and others

However, their areas of study may overlap with other [[geography|geographical sciences]] or may be considered on their own.

==History of economic geography==
The history of economic geography was influenced by many theories arising, mainly, from [[economics]] and [[geography|geographical sciences]].

First traces of the study of spatial aspects of economic activities can be found in [[History of Cartography#China|seven Chinese maps]] of the [[Qin (state)|State of Qin]] dating to the 4th century BC. Ancient writings can be attributed to the Greek geographer [[Strabo]]'s ''Geographika'' compiled almost 2000 years ago.  As the science of [[cartography]] developed, geographers illuminated many aspects used today in the field; maps created by different European powers described the resources likely to be found in American, African, and Asian territories.  The earliest travel journals included descriptions of the native peoples, the climate, the landscape, and the productivity of various locations.  These early accounts encouraged the development of transcontinental trade patterns and ushered in the era of [[mercantilism]].

The second world war to the popularization of geographical knowledge plays a significant positive effect. The post-war world economic recovery and development, promote the development of economic geography. 

During the period known in geography as [[environmental determinism]] notable (though later much criticized) influence came from [[Ellsworth Huntington]] and his theory of [[climatic determinism]].

Valuable contributions came from location theorists such as [[Johann Heinrich von Thünen]] or [[Alfred Weber]]. Other influential theories were [[Walter Christaller]]'s [[Central place theory]], the theory of core and periphery.

[[Fred K. Schaefer]]'s article ''Exceptionalism in geography: A Methodological Examination'' published in American journal Annals (Association of American Geographers) and his critique of regionalism had a big impact on economic geography. The article became a rallying point for the younger generation of economic geographers who were intent on reinventing the discipline as a science. Quantitative methods became prevailing in research. Well-known economic geographers of this period are [[William Garrison (geographer)|William Garrison]], [[Brian Berry]], [[Waldo Tobler]], [[Peter Haggett]], [[William Bunge]] and others.

Contemporary economic geographers tend to specialize in areas such as [[location theory]] and [[spatial analysis]] (with the help of [[geographic information systems]]), market research, geography of transportation, land or real estate price evaluation, regional and global development, planning, Internet geography, innovation, social networks and others.

==Economists and economic geographers==

{{POV-section|date=December 2009}}

Economists and economic geographers differ in their methods in approaching similar economic problems in several ways.  To generalize, an economic geographer will take a more holistic approach in the analysis of economic phenomena, which is to conceptualize a problem in terms of space, place and scale as well as the overt economic problem that is being examined. The economist approach, according to economic geographers, has four main drawbacks or manifestations of “economic orthodoxy that tends to homogenize the economic world in way that economic geographers try to avoid (Coe ''et al''. p.10)”.
