{{Taxation}}
An '''income tax''' is a [[tax]] levied on the [[income]] of individuals or businesses (corporations or other legal entities).  Various income tax systems exist, with varying degrees of [[tax incidence]]. Income taxation can be [[progressive tax|progressive]], [[flat tax|proportional]], or [[regressive tax|regressive]]. When the tax is levied on the income of companies, it is often called a [[corporate tax]], corporate income tax, or profit tax. Individual income taxes often tax the total income of the individual (with some deductions permitted), while corporate income taxes often tax net income (the difference between gross receipts, expenses, and additional write-offs).  Various systems define income differently, and often allow notional reductions of income (such as a reduction based on number of children supported).

==Principles of taxes==
The &quot;tax net&quot; refers to the types of payment that are taxed, which included personal earnings ([[wages]]), [[capital gain]]s, and business income. The rates for different types of income may vary and some may not be taxed at all. Capital gains may be taxed when realized (e.g. when shares are sold) or when incurred (e.g. when shares appreciate in value). Business income may only be taxed if it is significant or based on the manner in which it is paid. Some types of income, such as interest on bank savings, may be considered as personal earnings (similar to wages) or as a realized property gain (similar to selling shares). In some tax systems, personal earnings may be strictly defined where labor, skill, or investment is required (e.g. wages); in others, they may be defined broadly to include windfalls (e.g. gambling wins).

[[File:Federal Income Tax Rates in the US, 2009.jpg|thumb|A [[progressive tax]] applies higher tax rates as earnings reach higher levels.]]

Tax rates may be [[progressive tax|progressive]], [[regressive tax|regressive]], or [[proportional tax|proportional]]. A progressive tax applies progressively higher tax rates as earnings reach higher levels. For example, the first $10,000 in earnings may be taxed at 7%, the next $10,000 at 10%, and any more income at 30%. Alternatively, a proportional tax takes all earnings at the same rate. A regressive income tax may apply to income up to a certain amount, such as taxing only the first $90,000 earned. A tax system may use different taxation methods for different types of income.

Personal income tax is often collected on a [[PAYE|pay-as-you-earn]] basis, with small corrections made soon after the end of the [[tax year]]. These corrections take one of two forms: payments to the government by [[taxpayer]]s who did not pay enough during the tax year; and [[tax refund]]s from the government to those who overpaid. Income tax systems often have deductions available that lessen the total tax liability by reducing total taxable income. They may allow losses from one type of income to be counted against another. For example, a loss on the stock market may be deducted against taxes paid on wages. Other tax systems may isolate the loss, such that business losses can only be deducted against business tax by carrying forward the loss to later tax years.

The idea of a progressive tax has garnered support from macro economists and political scientists of many different [[ideologies]] - ranging from [[Adam Smith]] to [[Karl Marx]], although there are differences of opinion about the optimal level of progressivity. Some economists&lt;ref&gt;Stein, Herbert (1994, April 6). &quot;Board of Contributors: Remembering Adam Smith.&quot; ''Wall Street Journal'' (Eastern Edition), p. PAGE A14. Retrieved January 8, 2008, from Wall Street Journal database. (Document ID: 28143064).&lt;/ref&gt; trace the origin of modern progressive taxation to Adam Smith, who wrote in ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'':
{{quote|The necessaries of life occasion the great expense of the poor. They find it difficult to get food, and the greater part of their little revenue is spent in getting it. The luxuries and vanities of life occasion the principal expense of the rich, and a magnificent house embellishes and sets off to the best advantage all the other luxuries and vanities which they possess. A tax upon house-rents, therefore, would in general fall heaviest upon the rich; and in this sort of inequality there would not, perhaps, be anything very unreasonable. It is not very unreasonable that the rich should contribute to the public expense, not only in proportion to their revenue, but something more than in that proportion.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Smith, [http://www.adamsmith.org/smith/won-b5-c2-article-1-ss3.htm An Inquiry into the Nature And Causes of the Wealth of Nations] (1776). Book Five: Of the Revenue of the Sovereign or Commonwealth. CHAPTER II: Of the Sources of the General or Public Revenue of the Society. ARTICLE I: Taxes upon the Rent of House.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Income taxes are used in most countries around the world, but are not without criticism.  [[Frank Chodorov]] wrote &quot;... you come up with the fact that it gives the government a prior lien on all the property produced by its subjects.&quot; The government &quot;unashamedly proclaims the doctrine of collectivized wealth.&amp;nbsp;... That which it does not take is a concession.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;firstUS&quot;/&gt;  Some have argued that the economic effects of an income tax system penalize work, discourage [[saving]] and [[investing]], and hinder the competitiveness of business and economic growth.&lt;ref name=&quot;taxpanel&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taxreformpanel.gov/04132005.pdf|title=America Needs a Better Tax System|publisher=The President’s Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform|date=2005-04-13|accessdate=2007-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The state's take|url=http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14924473|date=19 November 2009|work=The Economist|accessdate=20 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Income taxes are also not border-adjustable; meaning the tax component embedded into products via taxes imposed on companies cannot be removed when exported to a foreign country ''(see [[Effect of taxes and subsidies on price]])''. Alternate tax systems such as a [[national sales tax]] or [[value added tax]] remove the tax component when goods are exported and apply the tax component on imports.&lt;ref name=&quot;LeoTestimony&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://waysandmeans.house.gov/hearings.asp?formmode=view&amp;id=5196| last=Linbeck| first=Leo| title=Testimony Before the Subcommittee on Select Revenue Measures| work=| publisher=House Committee on Ways and Means| date=2006-06-22| accessdate=2006-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
===Personal===
[[File:Taxa Real de IRS 2012-2013.svg|thumb|right|300px|Personal income taxes in [[Portugal]] for 2012/2013]]
A personal or individual income tax is levied on the total income of the individual (with some deductions permitted).  It is often collected on a [[PAYE|pay-as-you-earn]] basis, with small corrections made soon after the end of the [[tax year]]. These corrections take one of two forms: payments to the government, for [[taxpayer]]s who have not paid enough during the tax year; and [[tax refund]]s from the government for those who have overpaid. Income tax systems will often have deductions available that lessen the total tax liability by reducing total taxable income. They may allow losses from one type of income to be counted against another. For example, a loss on the stock market may be deducted against taxes paid on wages.

===Corporate===
{{main|Corporate tax}}
Corporate tax refers to a direct tax levied on the profits made by companies or associations and often includes capital gains of a [[company (law)|company]]. Earnings are generally considered gross revenue minus expenses. Corporate expenses related to capital expenditures are usually deducted in full (for example, trucks are fully deductible in the Canadian tax system, while a corporate sports car is only partly deductible) over their useful lives by using percentage rates based on the class of asset they belong to. 

Accounting principles and tax rules about recognition of expenses and revenue will vary at times, giving rise to book-tax differences.  If the book-tax difference is carried over more than a year, it is referred to as a [[deferred tax]]. Future assets and liabilities created by a deferred tax are reported on the [[balance sheet]].

:''See also: [[Excess profits tax]], [[Windfall profits tax]]''

===Payroll===
{{main|Payroll tax}}
A payroll tax generally refers to two kinds of [[tax]]es: [[employee]] and [[employer]] payroll taxes. Employee payroll taxes are taxes which employers are required to withhold from employees' [[wage|pay]], also known as [[Withholding tax|withholding]], [[PAYE|pay-as-you-earn]] (PAYE) or [[PAYG|pay-as-you-go]] (PAYG) tax. These withholdings contribute to the payment of an employee's personal income tax obligation; if the payments exceed this obligation, the employee may be eligible for a [[tax refund]] or carryforward to future periods.

Employer payroll taxes are paid from the employer's own funds, either as a fixed charge per employee or as a percentage of each employee's pay. Payroll taxes often cover government [[social insurance]] programs, such as [[social security]], [[Publicly-funded health care|health care]], [[unemployment]], and [[disability]]. These payments do not count toward the income taxes of employees and employers, but are normally deductible by the employer as a business expense.

===Inheritance===
{{main|Inheritance tax}}
The inheritance tax, estate tax and death duty are the names given to various taxes which arise on the death of an individual. In international tax law, there is a distinction between an estate tax and an inheritance tax: the former taxes the personal representatives of the deceased, while the latter taxes the beneficiaries of the estate. However, this distinction is not universally recognized. For example, the &quot;inheritance tax&quot; in the UK is a tax on personal representatives, and is therefore, strictly speaking, an excise tax.

===Capital gains tax===
{{main|Capital gains tax}}
A capital gains tax is the tax levied on profits from the sale of  capital assets. In many cases, the amount of a [[capital gain]] is treated as income and subject to the marginal rate of income tax.

In an inflationary environment, capital gains may be, to some extent, illusory. If prices in general have doubled over five years, then selling an asset for twice the price it was purchased at five years earlier represents no gain at all. Partly to compensate for such changes in the value of money over time, some jurisdictions, such as the United States, give a favorable capital gains tax rate based on the length of holding. European jurisdictions have a similar rate reduction to nil on certain property transactions that qualify for the participation exemption. In Canada, 20&amp;ndash;50% of the gain is taxable income. In India, Short Term Capital Gains Tax (arising before one year) is 10% [15 % from F.Y 2008-09 as per Finance Act 2008] flat rate of the gains and Long Term Capital Gains Tax is nil for stocks and mutual fund units held one year or more, provided the sale of shares involved payment of the Securities Transaction Tax, and 20% for any other assets held three years or more

==History==
The concept of taxing income is a modern innovation and presupposes several things: a [[money]] [[economy]], reasonably accurate [[Financial accountancy|accounts]], a common understanding of receipts, expenses and [[Profit (accounting)|profits]], and an orderly society with reliable records. For most of the history of [[civilization]], these preconditions did not exist, and taxes were based on other factors. Taxes on [[wealth]], social position, and ownership of the [[means of production]] (typically [[Real property|land]] and [[slaves]]) were all common. Practices such as [[tithe|tithing]], or an offering of firstfruits, existed from ancient times, and can be regarded as a precursor of the income tax, but they lacked precision and certainly were not based on a concept of net increase.

===China===
In the year 10 AD, Emperor [[Wang Mang]] of the [[Xin Dynasty]] instituted an unprecedented tax—the income tax—at the rate of 10 percent of profits, for professionals and skilled labor. (Previously, all taxes were either head tax or property tax.) He was overthrown 13 years later in 23 AD and earlier [[laissez-faire]] policies were restored during the [[Eastern Han Dynasty|Later Han]].

===United Kingdom===

{{main|Taxation in the United Kingdom#History}}

One of the first recorded taxes on income was the [[Saladin tithe]] introduced by [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] in 1188 to raise money for the [[Third Crusade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saladin Tithe|url=http://www.medievalsourcesbibliography.org/sources/1159550365}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tithe demanded that each [[layperson]] in England be taxed a tenth of their personal income and moveable property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Income tax in common law jurisdictions: from the origins to 1820, Volume 1|author=Peter Harris|year=2006|page=34|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HYvfTdbdkg4C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA34#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the inception date of the modern income tax is typically accepted as 1799.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Income tax in common law jurisdictions: from the origins to 1820, Volume 1|author=Peter Harris|year=2006|page=1|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HYvfTdbdkg4C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Income tax was announced in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] by [[William Pitt the Younger]] in his budget of December 1798 and introduced in 1799, to pay for weapons and equipment in preparation for the [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic wars]]. Pitt's new [[graduated income tax]] began at a levy of 2[[old pence|d]] in the [[Pound Sterling|pound]] (0.8333%) on annual incomes over £60 and increased up to a maximum of 2[[shilling|s]] in the pound (10%) on incomes of over £200 (£170,542 in 2007). Pitt hoped that the new income tax would raise £10 million (£8,527,100,000 in 2007), but actual receipts for 1799 totaled just over £6 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;first&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/history/taxhis1.htm|title=A tax to beat Napoleon|publisher=HM Revenue &amp; Customs|accessdate=2007-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tax was repealed in 1816 and opponents of the tax, who thought it should only be used to finance wars, wanted all records of the tax destroyed along with its repeal. Records were publicly burned by the Chancellor of the Exchequer but copies were retained in the basement of the tax court.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Charles 1998. Those Dirty Rotten TAXES, The Free Press, New York, NY&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{main|Income tax in the United States}} 

In order to help pay for its war effort in the [[American Civil War]], the [[Union (American Civil War)|US federal government]] imposed its first personal income tax, on August 5, 1861, as part of the [[Revenue Act of 1861]] (3% of all incomes over US $800) (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|800|1861|r=0}}}} in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}} dollars).&lt;ref name=&quot;Stat 1861&quot;&gt;Revenue Act of 1861, sec. 49, ch. 45, 12 Stat. 292, 309 (Aug. 5, 1861).&lt;/ref&gt;{{vs|date=February 2011}} This tax was repealed and replaced by another income tax in 1862.&lt;ref&gt;Sections 49, 51, and part of 50 repealed by Revenue Act of 1862, sec. 89, ch. 119, 12 Stat. 432, 473 (July 1, 1862); income taxes imposed under Revenue Act of 1862, section 86 (pertaining to salaries of officers, or payments to &quot;persons in the civil, military, naval, or other employment or service of the United States ...&quot;) and section 90 (pertaining to &quot;the annual gains, profits, or income of every person residing in the United States, whether derived from any kind of property, rents, interest, dividends, salaries, or from any profession, trade, employment or vocation carried on in the United States or elsewhere, or from any other source whatever....&quot;).&lt;/ref&gt;{{vs|date=February 2011}}

In 1894, [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democrat]]s in Congress passed the [[Wilson-Gorman tariff]], which imposed the first peacetime income tax. The rate was 2% on income over $4000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|4000|1894|r=2}}}} in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}} dollars), which meant fewer than 10% of households would pay any. The purpose of the income tax was to make up for revenue that would be lost by tariff reductions.&lt;ref&gt;Charles F. Dunbar, &quot;The New Income Tax,&quot; ''Quarterly Journal of Economics,'' Vol. 9, No. 1 (Oct., 1894), pp. 26–46 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/1883633 in JSTOR].&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the [[Panic of 1893]] is said{{By whom|date=April 2012}} to have something to do with the passage of Wilson-Gorman.

In 1895 the [[United States Supreme Court]], in its ruling in ''[[Pollock v. Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Co.]],'' held a tax based on receipts from the use of property to be unconstitutional. The Court held that taxes on [[Economic rent|rent]]s from real estate, on [[interest]] income from personal property and other income from personal property (which includes [[dividend]] income) were treated as direct taxes on property, and therefore had to be apportioned. Since apportionment of income taxes is impractical, this had the effect of prohibiting a federal tax on income from property. However, the Court affirmed that the Constitution did not deny Congress the power to impose a tax on real and personal property, and it affirmed that such would be a direct tax.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/D/1876-1900/reform/pollock.htm Chief Justice Fuller's opinion, 158 U.S. 601, 634].&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the political difficulties of taxing individual wages without taxing income from property, a federal income tax was impractical from the time of the ''Pollock'' decision until the time of ratification of the 16th Amendment in 1913.

In 1913, the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] made the income tax a permanent fixture in the U.S. tax system. The United States Supreme Court in its ruling ''[[Stanton v. Baltic Mining Co.]]'' stated that the amendment conferred no new power of taxation but simply prevented the courts from taking the power of income taxation possessed by Congress from the beginning out of the category of indirect taxation to which it inherently belongs. In fiscal year 1918, annual internal revenue collections for the first time passed the billion-dollar mark, rising to $5.4 billion by 1920. With the advent of World War II, employment increased, as did tax collections—to $7.3 billion. The withholding tax on wages was introduced in 1943 and was instrumental in increasing the number of taxpayers to 60 million and tax collections to $43 billion by 1945.&lt;ref name= &quot;firstUS&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url= http://mises.org/story/1597 | title=The Origin of the Income Tax | publisher=[[Ludwig von Mises Institute]] | last=Young | first=Adam | date=2004-09-07 | accessdate =2007-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Around the world==
{{main|Tax rates around the world|International taxation}}

Income taxes are used in most countries around the world.  The tax systems vary greatly and can be [[progressive tax|progressive]], [[flat tax|proportional]], or [[regressive tax|regressive]], depending on the type of tax.  Comparison of tax rates around the world is a difficult and somewhat subjective enterprise. Tax laws in most countries are extremely complex, and tax burden falls differently on different groups in each country and sub-national unit. Of course, services provided by governments in return for taxation also vary, making comparisons all the more difficult.

[[File:Individual taxation systems.png|right|thumb|300px|Systems of taxation on personal income{{legend|#00FF00|No income tax on individuals}}{{legend|#0080FF|Territorial}}{{legend|#000080|Residential}}{{legend|#FF00FF|Citizenship-based}}]]

Countries that tax income generally use one of two systems: territorial or residential. In the territorial system, only local income – income from a source inside the country – is taxed. In the residential system, residents of the country are taxed on their worldwide (local and foreign) income, while nonresidents are taxed only on their local income. In addition, a very small number of countries, notably the [[United States]], also tax their nonresident citizens on worldwide income.

Countries with a residential system of taxation usually allow deductions or credits for the tax that residents already pay to other countries on their foreign income. Many countries also sign [[tax treaty|tax treaties]] with each other to eliminate or reduce [[double taxation]].

Countries do not necessarily use the same system of taxation for individuals and corporations. For example, [[France]] uses a residential system for individuals but a territorial system for corporations,[http://www.deloitte.com/assets/Dcom-Global/Local%20Assets/Documents/Tax/Taxation%20and%20Investment%20Guides/2012/dttl_tax_highlight_2012_France.pdf International tax - France Highlights 2012], [[Deloitte]]. while [[Singapore]] does the opposite,[http://www.fullermoney.com/content/2012-07-17/dttl_tax_highlight_2012_Singapore.pdf International tax - Singapore Highlights 2012], [[Deloitte]]. and [[Brunei]] taxes corporate but not personal income.[http://www.deloitte.com/assets/Dcom-Global/Local%20Assets/Documents/Tax/Taxation%20and%20Investment%20Guides/2012/dttl_tax_highlight_2012_Brunei.pdf International tax - Brunei Darussalam Highlights 2012], [[Deloitte]].
