''Criminal Profiling: An Introduction to Behavioral Evidence Analysis'', Academic Press, 2008, p. 3. &quot;Blood libel: A false accusation of ritual murder made against one or more persons, typically of the Jewish faith&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chanes2004pp34-35&gt;Chanes, Jerome A. ''Antisemitism: A Reference Handbook'', ABC-CLIO, 2004, pp. 34–45. &quot;Among the most serious of these [anti-Jewish] manifestations, which reverberate to the present day, were those of the libels: the leveling of false charges against Jews, particularly the ''blood libel'' and the ''libel of desecrating the host''.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Goldish2008p8&gt;Goldish, Matt. ''Jewish Questions: Responsa on Sephardic Life in the Early Modern Period'', Princeton University Press, 2008, p. 8. &quot;In the period from the twelfth to the twentieth centuries, Jews were regularly charged with blood libel or ritual murder—false claims that Jews kidnapped and murdered Christian children as part of a Jewish religious ritual.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; that religious minorities, usually [[Jew]]s, murder children to use their [[human blood|blood]] in certain aspects of their [[religious ritual]]s and [[religious holiday|holiday]]s.&lt;ref name=JewishEncyclopedia /&gt;&lt;ref name=dundes /&gt;&lt;ref name=zeitlin&gt;Zeitlin, S [http://www.jstor.org/pss/1453766 &quot;The Blood Accusation&quot;] ''Vigiliae Christianae'', Vol. 50, No. 2 (1996), pp. 117-124&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, these claims—alongside those of [[well poisoning]] and [[host desecration]]—have been a major theme in [[History of the Jews in Europe|European persecution of Jews]].&lt;ref name=Chanes2004pp34-35/&gt;

Blood libels typically allege that Jews require human blood for the baking of [[matzo]]s for [[Passover]], although this element was absent in the earliest cases that claimed (the contemporary) Jews reenacted the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]]. The accusations often assert that the blood of [[Christian]] children is especially coveted, and, historically, blood libel claims have been made to account for otherwise unexplained deaths of children. In some cases, the alleged victim of [[human sacrifice]] has become venerated as a [[Christian martyr|martyr]], a holy figure around whom a martyr cult might arise. Four of these have been previously [[Canonization|canonized]] as [[saint]]s, namely [[William of Norwich]], [[Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln]], [[Simon of Trent]] (Simon was decanonized&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=z10-Xz9Kno4C&amp;pg=PA499&amp;lpg=PA499&amp;dq=simon+of+trent+decanonized&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aipG2ngVSV&amp;sig=CWFcz7UVKuLWeJ0cDLubFdYMPmM&amp;hl=uk&amp;ei=JmECTuuPC4Pu0gHf_Nm7Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwBw&lt;/ref&gt; in the 20th century), and [[Gavriil Belostoksky]] who remains canonized in the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].

In Jewish lore, blood libels were the impetus for the creation of the [[Golem#The_classic_narrative:_The_Golem_of_Prague|Golem of Prague]] by Rabbi [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel]] in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/golem.html Angelo S. Rappoport ''The Folklore of the Jews'' (London: Soncino Press, 1937)pp. 195-203]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Walter Laqueur]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Altogether, there have been about 150 recorded cases of blood libel (not to mention thousands of rumors) that resulted in the arrest and killing of Jews throughout history, most of them in the Middle Ages... In almost every case, Jews were murdered, sometimes by a mob, sometimes following torture and a trial.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Laqueur]] (2006): ''The Changing Face of Antisemitism: From Ancient Times to the Present Day'', Oxford University Press, ISBN 0-19-530429-2. p.56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Actual Jewish practices regarding blood and sacrifice==
The supposed torture and human sacrifice alleged in the blood libels run contrary to the teachings of Judaism. According to the Bible, God commanded Abraham in the [[Binding of Isaac]] to sacrifice his son, but ultimately provided a ram as a substitute. The [[Ten Commandments]] in the [[Torah]] forbid murder.  In addition, the use of blood (human or otherwise) in cooking is prohibited by the [[Kashrut|kosher dietary laws]] (kashrut).  Blood from slaughtered animals may not be consumed, and must be drained out of the animal and covered with earth. ({{bibleverse||Lev|17:12-13|31}}) According to the book of Leviticus, blood from sacrificed animals may only be placed on the altar of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Great Temple in Jerusalem]] (which no longer existed at the time of the Christian blood libels). Furthermore, consumption of human flesh would violate kashrut.&lt;ref&gt;[http://magentzedek.org/?page_id=81 What is Kashrut; ''&quot;Eating blood is forbidden. Blood is blood, whether it comes from a human being or an animal. In prohibiting the consumption of blood, the Torah seems to be concerned that it can excite a blood-lust in human beings and may desensitize us to the suffering of human beings when their blood is spilled.&quot;'']
&lt;/ref&gt;

While animal sacrifice was part of the practice of ancient Judaism, the [[Tanakh]] (Old Testament) and [[Halakha|Jewish teaching]] portray [[human sacrifice]] as one of the evils that separated the pagans of [[Canaan]] from the Hebrews ({{bibleverse||Deut|12:31|31}}, {{bibleverse|2|Kings|16:3|31}}).   Jews were prohibited from engaging in these rituals and were punished for doing so ({{bibleverse||Ex|34:15|31}}, {{bibleverse||Lev|20:2|31}}, {{bibleverse||Deut|18:12|31}}, {{bibleverse||Jer|7:31|31}}).  In fact, ritual cleanliness for priests prohibited even being in the same room as a human corpse ({{bibleverse||Lev|21:11|31}}).&lt;!-- a secondary to support the interpretations of tanakh --&gt;

==Suggested origins of the myth==

Professor Israel Jacob Yuval of the [[Hebrew University]] of Jerusalem published an article in 1993 that argues that blood libel may have originated in the 12th century from Christian views of Jewish behavior during the [[First Crusade]]. Some Jews committed suicide and killed their own children rather than be subjected to forced conversions. Yuval investigated Christian reports of these events and found that they were greatly distorted with claims that if Jews could kill their own children they could also kill Christian children. Yuval rejects the blood libel story as a fantasy of some Christians which could not contain any elements of truth because of the precarious nature of the Jewish minority's existence in Christian Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/827036.html | title = And if it's not good for the Jews? | author = Lily Galili | publisher = Ha'aretz | date = February 18, 2007 | accessdate = 2007-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;''Two Nations in Your Womb: Perceptions of Jews and Christians in Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages'' by Israel J.

==Notable instances==
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2010}}
There have been many blood libel accusations and trials of Jews, beginning in the 1st century and continuing through modern times.  A few of them are discussed here.

===Antiquity===
The origins of the blood libel are found in the writings of to the Graeco-Egyptian author [[Apion]], who claimed that Jews sacrificed Greek victims in [[Second Temple|their temple]].&lt;ref name=Turvey2008p3&gt;Turvey, Brent E. ''Criminal Profiling: An Introduction to Behavioral Evidence Analysis'', Academic Press, 2008, p. 3. &quot;Its origins are found in a report made by the anti-Semite scholar Apion to the Roman Emperor Caligula in 38 CE&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Apion repeated anti-Jewish slurs and &quot;absurd calumnies&quot; first made by [[Posidonius]] and [[Apollonius Molon]] in the 1st century BCE.&lt;ref name=Feldmanp1996p293&gt;Feldman, Louis H. ''Studies in Hellenistic Judaism'', Brill, 1996, p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in an attack on Jews in Alexandria in 38 CE in which thousands of Jews died.&lt;ref&gt;Per [[Philo of Alexandria]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Nonspecific|date=September 2010}} [[Socrates Scholasticus]] (fl. 5th Century) reported that some Jews in a drunken frolic bound a Christian child on a cross in mockery of the death of Christ and scourged him until he died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/syriabloodlibel.html |title=Blood libel in Syria |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2010-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===
{{main|William of Norwich|Werner of Oberwesel|Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln|Andreas Oxner}}
In England in 1144 Jews of [[Norwich]] were accused of [[ritual murder]] after a boy, [[William of Norwich]], was found dead with stab wounds in the woods. The legend was turned into a cult, with William acquiring the status of martyr and crowds of pilgrims bringing wealth to the local church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15635a.htm|title=St. William of Norwich|accessdate=2012-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was followed by similar accusations in [[Harold (martyr)|Gloucester (1168)]], [[Robert of Bury|Bury St Edmunds (1181)]] and Bristol (1183). In 1189, the Jewish deputation attending the coronation of [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]] was attacked by the crowd. [[History of the Jews in England#Massacres at London and York (1189–1190)|Massacres of Jews at London and York]] soon followed. On Feb 6 1190, the Norwich Jews were butchered in their homes,&lt;ref&gt;Ralph de Diceto. Imagines Historiarum&lt;/ref&gt; only those who found refuge in the castle survived. The remains of 17 bodies thrown in a well in Norwich between the 12th and 13th century (5 that were shown by DNA testing to likely be members of a single Jewish family) were very possibly killed as part of one of these pogroms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13855238 | work=BBC News | title=Jewish bodies found in medieval well in Norwich | date=June 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jews would later be [[Edict of Expulsion|expelled from all of England]] in 1290 and not allowed to return until 1655. In 1171, [[Blois]] was the site of a blood libel accusation against its Jewish community that led to 31 Jews (by some accounts 40) being burned to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article.asp?AID=112387 |title=The Martyrs of Blois |publisher=Chabad.org |date=2006-06-16 |accessdate=2010-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=trachtenberg&gt;{{Cite book |editor1-last = Trachtenberg |editor1-first = Joshua |year = 1943 |title = THE DEVIL AND THE JEWS, The Medieval Conception of the Jew and its Relation to Modern Anti-Semitism |publisher = Yale University Press |isbn = 0-8276-0227-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early blood libel appears in ''Bonum Universale de Apibus'' ii. 29, § 23, by [[Thomas of Cantimpré]] (a monastery near Cambray). Thomas wrote &quot;It is quite certain that the Jews of every province annually decide by lot which congregation or city is to send Christian blood to the other congregations.&quot;
Thomas also believed that since the time when the Jews called out to [[Pontius Pilate]], &quot;His blood be on us, and on our children&quot; ({{bibleverse||Matthew|27:25|NIV}}), they have been afflicted with hemorrhages:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A very learned Jew, who in our day has been converted to the (Christian) faith, informs us that one enjoying the reputation of a prophet among them, toward the close of his life, made the following prediction: 'Be assured that relief from this secret ailment, to which you are exposed, can only be obtained through Christian blood (&quot;''solo sanguine Christiano''&quot;).' This suggestion was followed by the ever-blind and impious Jews, who instituted the custom of annually shedding Christian blood in every province, in order that they might recover from their malady.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Thomas added that the Jews had misunderstood the words of their prophet, who by his expression &quot;''solo sanguine Christiano''&quot; had meant not the blood of any Christian, but that of Jesus—the only true remedy for all physical and spiritual suffering.
Thomas did not mention the name of the &quot;very learned&quot; proselyte, but it may have been [[Nicholas Donin]] of [[La Rochelle]], who in 1240 had a disputation on the [[Talmud]] with [[Yechiel of Paris]], and who in 1242 caused the burning of numerous Talmudic manuscripts in Paris. It is known that Thomas was personally acquainted with this Nicholas.

The case of [[Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln]] is mentioned by [[Chaucer]], and thus has become well-known. A child of eight years, named Hugh, son of a woman named Beatrice, disappeared at [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] on 31 July 1255. His body was discovered on 29 August, covered with filth, in a pit or well belonging to a Jewish man named Copin or Koppin. On being promised by John of Lexington, a judge, who happened to be present, that his life should be spared, Copin is said to have confessed that the boy had been crucified by the Jews, who had assembled at Lincoln for that purpose. [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]], on reaching Lincoln at the beginning of October, refused to carry out the promise of John of Lexington, and had Copin executed and 91 of the Jews of Lincoln seized and sent up to London, where 18 of them were executed. The rest were pardoned at the intercession of the Franciscans (Jacobs, ''Jewish Ideals'', pp.&amp;nbsp;192–224).

At [[Pforzheim]], Baden, the corpse of a seven-year-old girl was found in the river by fishermen. The Jews were suspected, and when they were led to the corpse, blood allegedly began to flow from the wounds; led to it a second time, the face of the child became flushed, and both arms were raised. In addition to these miracles, there was the testimony of the daughter of the wicked woman who had sold the child to the Jews. A regular judicial examination did not take place; it is probable that the above-mentioned &quot;wicked woman&quot; was the murderess. That a judicial murder was then and there committed against the Jews in consequence of the accusation is evident from the manner in which the [[Nuremberg]] &quot;Memorbuch&quot; and the synagogal poems refer to the incident ([[Siegmund Salfeld]], ''Das Martyrologium des Nürnberger Memorbuches'' (1898), pp.&amp;nbsp;15, 128-130). At Weissenburg, a miracle alone decided the charge against the Jews. According to the accusation, the Jews had suspended a child (whose body was found in the Lauter river) by the feet, and had opened every artery in his body to obtain all the blood. Again, supernatural claims were made: the child's wounds were said to have bled for five days afterward, despite its treatment.

At Oberwesel, &quot;miracles&quot; again constituted the only evidence against the Jews. The corpse of the 11-year-old [[Werner of Oberwesel]] was said to have floated up the Rhine (against the current) as far as Bacharach, emitting radiance, and being invested with healing powers. In consequence, the Jews of Oberwesel and many other adjacent localities were severely persecuted during the years 1286-89. Emperor Rudolph I, to whom the Jews had appealed for protection, issued a public proclamation to the effect that great wrong had been done to the Jews, and that the corpse of Werner was to be burned and the ashes scattered to the winds. The statement was made, in the &quot;Chronicle&quot; of [[Konrad Justinger]] of 1423, that at [[Bern]] in 1294 the Jews tortured and murdered a boy called Rudolph. The historical impossibility of this widely credited story was demonstrated by Jakob Stammler, pastor of Bern, in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Katholische Schweizer-Blätter,&quot; Lucerne, 1888.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been speculated whether the [[Kindlifresserbrunnen]] (&quot;Child Eater Fountain&quot;) in Bern might refer to the alleged ritual murder of 1294.

===Renaissance and Baroque===
[[File:Judensau Frankfurt.jpg|thumb|From an 18th-century etching from Brückenturm. ''Above'': The murdered body of Simon of Trent. ''Below'': The &quot;[[Judensau]].&quot;]]

[[Simon of Trent]], aged two, disappeared, and his father alleged that he had been kidnapped and murdered by the local Jewish community. Fifteen local Jews were sentenced to death and burned. Simon was regarded as a saint, and was canonized by [[Pope Sixtus V]] in 1588. His status as a saint was removed in 1965 by [[Pope Paul VI]], though his murder is still promoted as a fact by a handful of extremists.

Christopher of Toledo, also known as Christopher of La Guardia or &quot;the [[Holy Child of La Guardia]],&quot; was a four-year-old Christian boy supposedly murdered by two Jews and three [[Converso]]s (converts to Christianity).  In total, eight men were executed.  It is now believed&lt;ref&gt;Reston, James: &quot;Dogs of God: Columbus, the Inquisition, and the defeat of the Moors&quot;, page 207. Doubleday, 2005. ISBN 0-385-50848-4&lt;/ref&gt; that this case was constructed by the [[Spanish Inquisition]] to facilitate the [[Alhambra decree|expulsion of Jews from Spain]].  He was canonized by [[Pope Pius VII]] in 1805. Christopher has since been removed from the canon, though once again, a handful of individuals still claim the validity of this case.
[[File:Schedel judenfeindlichkeit.jpg|thumb|left| The story of Simon of Trent (1475), by Hartmann Schedels (1493)]]

In a case at Tyrnau (Nagyszombat, today [[Trnava]], [[Slovakia]]), the absurdity, even the impossibility, of the statements forced by torture from women and children shows that the accused preferred death as a means of escape from the torture, and admitted everything that was asked of them. They even said that Jewish men menstruated, and that the latter therefore practiced the drinking of Christian blood as a remedy.

At Bösing (Bazin, today [[Pezinok]], [[Slovakia]]), it was charged that a nine-year-old boy had been bled to death, suffering cruel torture; thirty Jews confessed to the crime and were publicly burned. The true facts of the case were disclosed later, when the child was found alive in Vienna. He had been stolen by the accuser, Count Wolf of Bazin, as a fiendish means of ridding himself of his Jewish creditors at Bazin.

[[File:Antisemitic-church-fresco.jpg|thumb|[[Fresco]] in St Paul's Church in [[Sandomierz]], Poland, depicting blood libel]]

At [[Rinn]], near [[Innsbruck]], a boy named [[Andreas Oxner]] (also known as Anderl von Rinn) was said to have been bought by Jewish merchants and cruelly murdered by them in a forest near the city, his blood being carefully collected in vessels. The accusation of drawing off the blood (without murder) was not made until the beginning of the 17th century, when the cult was founded. The older inscription in the church of Rinn, dating from 1575, is distorted by fabulous embellishments&amp;mdash;for example, that the money paid for the boy to his godfather turned into leaves, and that a lily blossomed upon his grave.  The cult continued until officially prohibited in 1994 by the Bishop of Innsbruck.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/rinn.html Medieval Sourcebook: A Blood Libel Cult: Anderl von Rinn, d. 1462] www.fordham.edu.&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century===
The only child-saint in the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] is the six-year-old boy [[Gavriil Belostoksky]] from the village Zverki. According to the legend supported by the church, the boy was kidnapped from his home during the holiday of [[Passover]] while his parents were away. Shutko, who was a Jew from [[Białystok]], was accused of bringing the boy to Białystok, poking him with sharp objects and draining his blood for nine days, then bringing the body back to Zverki and dumping it at a local field. A cult developed, and the boy was canonized in 1820. His relics are still the object of pilgrimage. On [[All Saints Day]], July 27, 1997, the Belorussian state TV showed a film alleging the story is true.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vestnik.com/issues/97/0902/win/stonov.htm Is the New in the Post-Soviet Space Only the Forgotten Old?] by Leonid Stonov, International Director of Bureau for the Human Rights and Law-Observance in the Former Soviet Union, the President of the American Association of Jews from the former USSR)&lt;/ref&gt; The revival of the cult in [[Belarus]] was cited as a dangerous expression of antisemitism in international reports on human rights and religious freedoms&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.4humanrights.org/by/eng/reports/relig2003.shtml Belarus.

*1840 [[Damascus affair]]: In February, at Damascus, a Catholic monk named Father Thomas and his servant disappeared. The accusation of ritual murder was brought against members of the Jewish community of Damascus.

*1840 [[Rhodes blood libel]]: The Jews of [[Rhodes]], under the [[Ottoman Empire]], were accused of murdering a [[Greeks|Greek]] Christian boy. The libel was supported by the local governor and the European consuls posted to Rhodes. Several Jews were arrested and tortured, and the entire Jewish quarter was blockaded for twelve days. An investigation carried out by the central Ottoman government found the Jews to be innocent.

*In March 1879, ten Jewish men from a mountain village were brought to [[Kutaisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] to stand trial for the alleged kidnapping and murder of a Christian girl. The case attracted a great deal of attention in Russia (of which Georgia was then a part): &quot;While periodicals as diverse in tendency as ''[[Vestnik Evropy|Herald of Europe]]'' and ''[[Sankt-Peterburgskie Vedomosti|Saint Petersburg Notices]]'' expressed their amazement that medieval prejudice should have found a place in the modern judiciary of a civilized state, ''[[Novoye Vremya (newspaper)|New Times]]'' hinted darkly of strange Jewish sects with unknown practices.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Effie Ambler, ''Russian Journalism and Politics: The Career of Aleksei S. Suvorin, 1861-1881'' (Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1972: ISBN 0-8143-1461-9), p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; The trial ended in acquittal, and the orientalist [[Daniel Chwolson]] published a refutation of the blood libel.

*1882 [[Tiszaeszlár blood libel]]: The Jews of the village [[Tiszaeszlár]], [[Hungary]] were accused of the ritual murder of a fourteen-year-old Christian girl, Eszter Solymosi. The case was one of the main causes of the rise of antisemitism in the country. The accused persons were eventually acquitted.

*In 1899 [[Hilsner Affair]]: Leopold Hilsner, a Jewish vagabond, was accused of murdering a nineteen-year-old Christian woman, Anežka Hrůzová, with a slash to the throat.  Despite the absurdity of the charge and the relatively progressive nature of society in [[Austria-Hungary]], Hilsner was convicted and sentenced to death.  He was later convicted of an additional unsolved murder, also involving a Christian woman.  In 1901, the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. [[Tomáš Masaryk]], a prominent Austro-Czech philosophy professor and future president of [[Czechoslovakia]], spearheaded Hilsner's defense. He was later blamed by Czech media because of this. In March 1918, Hilsner was pardoned by Austrian emperor [[Karl of Austria|Charles I]].  He was never exonerated, and the true guilty parties were never found.

*The 1903 [[Kishinev pogrom]], an anti-Jewish revolt, started when an anti-Semitic newspaper wrote that a Christian Russian boy, Mikhail Rybachenko, was found murdered in the town of [[Dubăsari|Dubossary]], alleging that the Jews killed him in order to use the blood in preparation of matzo. Around 49 Jews were killed and hundreds were wounded, with over 700 houses being looted and destroyed.

*In the 1910 [[Shiraz blood libel]], the Jews of [[Shiraz]], [[Iran]], were falsely accused of murdering a Muslim girl. The entire Jewish quarter was pillaged; the pogrom left 12 Jews dead and about 50 injured.

*Jews were frequently accused of ritual murder of Christians for their blood in ''[[Der Stürmer]]'', an antisemitic newspaper published in [[Nazi Germany]].

*''[[The Matzah Of Zion]]'' was written by the [[Syrian Ministry of Defense|Syrian Defense Minister]], [[Mustafa Tlass]] in 1986.

This series originally aired in Lebanon in late 2003 and was broadcast by ''[[Al-Manar]]'', a satellite television network owned by [[Hezbollah]].

* In early January 2005, some 20 members of the [[Russia]]n [[State Duma]] publicly made a blood libel against the Jewish people. They approached the Prosecutor General’s Office and demanded that Russia &quot;ban all Jewish organizations.”  They accused all Jewish groups of being extremists and of being “anti-Christian and inhumane, which practices extend even to ritual murders.” Alluding to previous antisemitic Russian court decrees that accused the Jews of ritual murder, they wrote that “Many facts of such religious extremism were proven in courts.” The accusation included traditional [[antisemitic canards]], such as “the whole democratic world today is under the financial and political control of international Jewry. And we do not want our Russia to be among such unfree countries”. This demand was published as an open letter to the prosecutor general, in ''Rus Pravoslavnaya'' ({{lang-ru|Русь православная}}, &quot;Orthodox Russia&quot;), a national-conservative newspaper. This group consisted of members of the ultra-nationalist [[Liberal Democratic Party of Russia|Liberal Democrats]], the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation|Communist faction]], and the nationalist [[Motherland (Russia)|Motherland party]], with some 500 supporters.

*During interview which aired on ''[[Rotana (television)|Rotana Khalijiya TV]]'' on August 13, 2012, Saudi Cleric Salman Al-Odeh stated (as translated by [[MEMRI]]) that &quot;It is well-known that the Jews celebrate several holidays, one of which is the Passover, or the Matzos Holiday. I read once about a doctor who was working in a laboratory. This doctor lived with a Jewish family. One day, they said to him: 'We want blood. Get us some human blood.' He was confused. He didn't know what this was all about. Of course, he couldn't betray his work ethics in such a way, but he began inquiring, and he found that they were making matzos with human blood.&quot; Al-Odeh also stated that &quot;[Jews] eat it, believing that this brings them close to their false god, [[Yahweh]]&quot; and that &quot;They would lure a child in order to sacrifice him in the religious rite that they perform during that holiday.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memritv.org/clip_transcript/en/3536.htm Saudi Cleric Salman Al-Odeh: Jews Use Human Blood for Passover Matzos], MEMRITV, Clip No. 3536, (transcript), August 13, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/saudi-cleric-accuses-jewish-people-of-genocide-drinking-human-blood/ Saudi cleric accuses Jewish people of genocide, drinking human blood] by Ilan Ben Zion, ''[[The Times of Israel]]'', August 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views of the Catholic Church==
The attitude of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] towards these accusations and the cults venerating children supposedly killed by Jews has varied over time. The papacy generally opposed them, although it had problems in enforcing its opposition.

In 1911, the ''Dictionnaire apologétique de la foi catholique'', an important French Catholic encyclopedia, published an analysis of the blood libel accusations.&lt;ref&gt;English translation [http://counterenlightenment.blogspot.com/2011/04/blood-libel-view-from-1911.html here].&lt;/ref&gt; This may be taken as being broadly representative of educated Catholic opinion in continental Europe at that time. The article noted that the popes had generally refrained from endorsing the blood libel, and it concluded that the accusations were unproven in a general sense, but it left open the possibility that some Jews had committed ritual murders of Christians.  Other contemporary Catholic sources (notably the Jesuit periodical ''Civiltà cattolica'') took a more hostile view.&lt;ref&gt;As shown by David Kertzer in ''The Popes Against the Jews'' (New York, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the accusations are almost entirely discredited in Catholic circles, and the cults associated with them have fallen into disfavour.  For example, Simon of Trent was deleted from the Calendar of Saints in 1965 and does not appear in the current (2000) edition of the Roman Martyrology.

===Papal pronouncements===
*[[Pope Innocent IV]] took action against the blood libel: &quot;5 July 1247 &quot;Mandate to the prelates of Germany and France to annul all measures adopted against the Jews on account of the ritual murder libel, and to prevent accusation of Arabs on similar charges&quot; (The Apostolic See and the Jews, Documents: 492-1404; Simonsohn, Shlomo, p.&amp;nbsp;188-189,193-195,208).  In 1247 he wrote also that &quot;Certain of the clergy, and princes, nobles and great lords of your cities and dioceses have falsely devised certain godless plans against the Jews, unjustly depriving them by force of their property, and appropriating it themselves;...they falsely charge them with dividing up among themselves on the Passover the heart of a murdered boy...In their malice, they ascribe every murder, wherever it chance to occur, to the Jews. And on the ground of these and other fabrications, they are filled with rage against them, rob them of their possessions without any formal accusation, without confession, and without legal trial and conviction, contrary to the privileges granted to them by the Apostolic See...Since it is our pleasure that they shall not be disturbed,...we ordain that ye behave towards them in a friendly and kind manner. Whenever any unjust attacks upon them come under your notice, redress their injuries, and do not suffer them to be visited in the future by similar tribulations&quot; (''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (1910), Vol. 8, pp.&amp;nbsp;393–394). [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08017a.htm]
*[[Pope Benedict XIV]] wrote a bull ''Beatus Andreas'' (22 February 1755) in which he does not express any doubt concerning the murders of children ascribed to the Jews. He states they are perpetrated &quot;out of hatred of Christ&quot; and &quot;out of hatred for the Christian faith&quot; in his ''De servorum Dei beatificatione''.  In the bull he speaks about determining what is to be done &quot;when there arises a case of this sort, which often comes to be put forward, concerning some boy who was slain by the Hebrews in Holy Week out of hostility to Christ, such as Blessed Simon and Anderl and also many of the other murdered boys whom the authors mention&quot;.
*[[Pope Gregory X]] (1271–1276) issued a letter which criticized the practice of blood libels and forbid arrests and persecution of Jews based on a blood libel, ''...unless &amp;ndash;which we do not believe &amp;ndash; they be caught in the commission of the crime.'' .&lt;ref name=&quot;gregx&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/g10-jews.html | title=Medieval Sourcebook: Gregory X: Letter on Jews, (1271-76) - Against the Blood Libel | author=[[Pope Gregory X]] | accessdate=2007-05-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[St. Pius V]] in the bull ''Hebraeorum gens'' (26 February 1569) did not reference blood libel, but he did make multiple accusations against the Jews, including: usury, theft, receiving stolen goods, pimping, divination and magic.  He finishes with this accusation: &quot;Finally, we have sufficiently investigated and explored how unworthily this perverse race attacks the name of Christ; how much hated it is by all those who bear that name; and, finally, with what cunning it plots against their lives.&quot;
*[[Paul III]], in a bull of 12 May 1540, made clear his displeasure at having learned, through the complaints of the Jews of Hungary, Bohemia and Poland, that their enemies, looking for a pretext to lay their hands on the Jews' property, were falsely attributing terrible crimes to them, in particular that of killing children and drinking their blood.

==Views of Muslim authorities==
In late 1553 or 1554, [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], the reigning [[Sultan]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]], issued a [[firman (decree)|firman]] (royal decree) formally denouncing blood libels against the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mansel |first=Phillip |title=Constantinople : City of the World's Desire, 1453–1924|year= 1998|publisher= St. Martin's Griffin |location= New York |isbn= 978-0-312-18708-8 |page= 124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the Egyptian newspaper Al-Ahram published a series of articles by Osama Al-Baz, a senior advisor to then Egyptian President [[Hosni Mubarak]]. Among other things, Osam Al-Baz explained the origins of the blood libel against the Jews. He said that Arabs and Muslims have never been antisemitic, as a group, but accepted that a few Arab writers and media figures attack Jews &quot;on the basis of the racist fallacies and myths that originated in Europe&quot;. He urged people not to succumb to &quot;myths&quot; such as the blood libel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Osama El-Baz |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2003/619/focus.htm |title=Al-Ahram Weekly Online, January 2–8, 2003 (Issue No. 619) |publisher=Weekly.ahram.org.eg |date= |accessdate=2010-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
