== Traveling overseers ==
*(Section copied from [[Talk:Jehovah's_Witnesses#Traveling_overseers_appointed_by_GBJW]])--[[User:Jeffro77|&lt;span style='color:#365F91'&gt;'''Jeffro'''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='color:#FFC000'&gt;''77''&lt;/span&gt;]] ([[User talk:Jeffro77|talk]]) 10:59, 3 August 2010 (UTC)

The article ''[[Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses]]'' should probably have two new subheadings under ''[[Organizational_structure_of_Jehovah's_Witnesses#Governing_Body|Governing Body]]'', for:
* [[Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses#Branch committees]] and 
* [[Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses#Traveling overseers]].
That would make the place of those ''persons'' (role descriptions) more clear in the organizational flowchart. As is described elsewhere regarding JWs...
* Whereas a ''branch office'' may be under a corporation, ''branch committees'' answer directly to the GBJW.
* Whereas ''districts'' and ''circuits'' are under ''branches'', district and circuit (and zone) ''overseers'' in significant respects are answerable primarily to the GBJW (the various branch office staff handles secondary workaday matters).
I'll try to get around to it, but am pretty busy [[in real life|IRL]]. --[[User:AuthorityTam|AuthorityTam]] ([[User talk:AuthorityTam|talk]]) 22:11, 2 August 2010 (UTC)
:I'm not sure it is necessary to have branch ''committees'' in a separate section to branch ''offices''. It should be adequate to indicate the line of authority in the relevant sections while maintaining separate sections. Having them as ''subsections'' of 'Governing Body' could imply they are part of the GB, unless the ''entire'' structure (including 'Congregations' etc) were adapted to a hierarchical heading structure, but that may result in an ungainly number of heading levels. On a related issue, I think that the Corporations section shouldn't be ''between'' Governing Body and other divisions subsidiary to the GB.--[[User:Jeffro77|&lt;span style='color:#365F91'&gt;'''Jeffro'''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='color:#FFC000'&gt;''77''&lt;/span&gt;]] ([[User talk:Jeffro77|talk]]) 09:21, 3 August 2010 (UTC)

== Next step in the hierarchy ==

Let's see, Unbaptized publishers, Minors, Students, Associates ... I think we should be seeing a new section soon on &quot;Unborn children of baptized Witnesses&quot;. From there it will be &quot;Householders&quot;, followed by &quot;Not at homes&quot; &quot;Do not calls&quot;, &quot;Passers-by&quot; and &quot;Billions not yet contacted and who will die at Armageddon as a result&quot;. Where will this tedious and absurd detail end? [[User:BlackCab|BlackCab]] ([[User talk:BlackCab|talk]]) 23:00, 12 August 2010 (UTC)
:The [[Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses#Congregations|Congregation subsections]] aren't ''really'' hierarchical, although each is listed in descending order of &quot;privilege&quot; and &quot;responsibility&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;The idea behind the new sections didn't originate with me.&lt;br /&gt;See [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Jehovah's Witnesses#Jehovah's Witnesses and Family Members]].&lt;br /&gt;Editors may recall that a difference between an '''A''' and a '''B''' quality article is that the latter &quot;may not be complete enough to satisfy a serious student or researcher.&quot; See [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Christianity/Assessment#Quality scale]].&lt;br /&gt;--[[User:AuthorityTam|AuthorityTam]] ([[User talk:AuthorityTam|talk]]) 05:19, 13 August 2010 (UTC)
::There's detail and there's detail. I think it's getting a bit too damned detailed. The proposal for Jehovah's Witnesses and Family Members seemed to be aimed at creating an article critical of the disfellowshipping policy, so I'm not sure how the two ideas are connected. [[User:BlackCab|BlackCab]] ([[User talk:BlackCab|talk]]) 06:54, 13 August 2010 (UTC)
:::The purpose of the article is not to provide all the jargon terms that JWs use for various levels of people, especially if those people are not even members. Nor is it necessary to elaborate on every context in which a particular JW term is used. It is also unnecessary to provide bleedingly obvious detail, such as the fact that 'violent people may be told they're not welcome'. I have trimmed and arranged the new sections accordingly.--[[User:Jeffro77|&lt;span style='color:#365F91'&gt;'''Jeffro'''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='color:#FFC000'&gt;''77''&lt;/span&gt;]] ([[User talk:Jeffro77|talk]]) 09:01, 13 August 2010 (UTC)
::::Regarding &quot;[[Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses#Associates|associates]]&quot;...to some extent, that's the issue: most denominations calculate &quot;membership&quot; from simple attendance rather than participation. It seems likely that JWs publish certain attendance statistics specifically so that academics and others can make more meaningful comparisons. What may be obvious to those familiar with the religion may be a point of confusion for a person beginning to study it. Regarding &quot;children&quot;, I'm unconvinced that term is preferable to &quot;minors&quot;... The matter of children was just intended to be thorough, as is an explicit distinction between lower- and higher-graded articles.--[[User:AuthorityTam|AuthorityTam]] ([[User talk:AuthorityTam|talk]]) 21:48, 10 January 2011 (UTC)
:::::I agree with your assessment of 'associates' for the same reason.
:::::I don't have a strong preference for using either the word 'minors' or 'children'. But not, 'minor children' as it would be redundant.--[[User:Jeffro77|&lt;span style='color:#365F91'&gt;'''Jeffro'''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='color:#FFC000'&gt;''77''&lt;/span&gt;]] ([[User talk:Jeffro77|talk]]) 08:44, 12 January 2011 (UTC)
::::::In the United States, it is common for a parent and others to refer to her offspring as &quot;my/her children&quot; during their entire lives (that is, through the offsprings' adulthoods). The term &quot;minor children&quot; is not redundant in the context of this article section; aside from &quot;[[JW organization#Baptized publishers|publishers]]&quot;, participants in JWs' formal ministry must be BOTH 1) minor (younger than an accepted age of majority) AND 2) children/dependents of a &quot;publisher&quot;. Because a &quot;publisher&quot; may have &quot;adult children&quot; or &quot;minor children&quot;, the latter term is not redundant, and so I have reinstated the term &quot;minor children&quot; (rather than merely &quot;children&quot;) in its initial instance in the relevant section. --&lt;span style=&quot;border:1px solid black;padding:1px;&quot;&gt;[[User:AuthorityTam|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#ffffff;background:black;&quot;&gt;AuthorityTam&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;font style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:AuthorityTam|talk]][[Special:Contributions/AuthorityTam|…contrib]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 17:56, 6 September 2012 (UTC)
:::::::The context and general understanding of the term ''children'' is readily apparent, irrespective of broader colloquial use of the term.--[[User:Jeffro77|&lt;span style='color:#365F91'&gt;'''Jeffro'''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='color:#FFC000'&gt;''77''&lt;/span&gt;]] ([[User talk:Jeffro77|talk]]) 07:02, 7 September 2012 (UTC)

==City overseer==
An editor alleged that Jehovah's Witnesses have discontinued the position and term &quot;city overseer&quot;, but no source was cited to contradict the 2005 reference. Please do not remove the article's discussion of &quot;city overseer&quot; without sourcing the supposed change or building consensus here for that removal. --&lt;span style=&quot;border:1px solid black;padding:1px;&quot;&gt;[[User:AuthorityTam|&lt;font style=&quot;color:#ffffff;background:black;&quot;&gt;AuthorityTam&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;font style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:AuthorityTam|talk]][[Special:Contributions/AuthorityTam|…contrib]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 17:56, 6 September 2012 (UTC)</text>
