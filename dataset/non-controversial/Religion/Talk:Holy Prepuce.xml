==Reliability?==
Where is the evidence even for the existence of this supposed relic?  All I see mentioned are quotes from old anti-Catholic sources, who had an interest in invoking spurious but laughable relics as a way to mock what they saw as the absurdity of Catholicism.  None of the Catholic sources referred to mention the &quot;Holy Prepuce&quot; at all.  And on the web, the only references to this relic are quotes from this very article!  What about the supposed theft of such a relic in 1983?  Where is the news article referring to that?  Not, apparently, available. --Randomcritic.

:If you search a little deeper on the net, you'll find some neutral and even pro catholic sites mentioning the holy prepuce. It would seem that the Vatican has moved away from veneration of Holy Relics. Also this particular relic may lead people to thoughts about Jesus which are not exactly spiritual. Hence it is not really surprising that something which was venerated a few hundred years ago, is now mostly forgotten. Also please sign your name after a comment, otherwise no one knows who is writing. Thanks. --[[User:Dumbo1|Dumbo1]] 23:57, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

::Don't tell me to search deeper on the net -- I already did a considerable amount of searching, but that's not the point.  This is a reference project!  It should be one-stop shopping for sources -- not &quot;oh, there's more out there, just look around&quot;.  If you've found some reliable sources on the topic, stick 'em in the body of the article. And the higher you can get up the citation tree the better.  And if you can find a contemporary article on the 1983 theft, best of all.  --Randomcritic.

this all used to be at newadvent.org a couple years ago, even some of the same wording (specifically that bit about how &quot;The Pope declined the opportunity&quot; to investigate a foreskin brought for his inspection). i emailed it to myself when i found it, because it's hilarious. but now they seem to have taken it all off the site. --[[User:Kingnixon|dan]] 22:48, 13 July 2006 (UTC)

You'll find that Marc-Antoine Muret's oration of January 1, 1584, is dedicated to the topic of the circumcision, and on the appropriate feast day as well: [http://www.chlt.org/sandbox/colloquia/orationes/page.29.a.php] [[Special:Contributions/74.137.88.47|74.137.88.47]] ([[User talk:74.137.88.47|talk]]) 19:46, 21 September 2008 (UTC)

==no deterioration??==
A foreskin is just skin, right? Wouldn't it have rotted and deteriorated after all this time? Something should be mentioned in the article about that. -[[User:Branddobbe|Branddobbe]] 20:05, Feb 19, 2004 (UTC)

:It is skin and flesh.  Still, there are a number of options open for someone who wanted to preserve it: drying it out (mummification) is the most obvious.  I'm a bit more curious as to whether it is or ever was common in Jewish homes to keep shorn foreskins as a keepsake.  If it is not the custom, it strikes me as somewhat unusual that Jesus' foreskin would have been kept for the relic trade.  -- [[User:Ihcoyc|Smerdis of Tlön]] 21:42, 19 Feb 2004 (UTC)

:: Jewish tradition dictates that the skin is buried almost immediately. As is typical of Judaism the body must be ritually returned to the ground upon death or dismemberment (hence they'll go to great lengths to recover the bodies of the dead). It'd be highly unusual, not to mention anathema to preserve and keep a part of the body and not bury it upon or before the owner's death; Jesus might've been the founder of Christianity but he was still born a Jew which meant he would've been expected to be beholden to their traditions til he made his own choices in adulthood. --[[Special:Contributions/85.62.18.8|85.62.18.8]] ([[User talk:85.62.18.8|talk]]) 13:57, 23 January 2009 (UTC)

This is nothing if you compare with one cathedral in the 11th century who claimed to have the head of John the Baptist when he was *twelve*. And my neighbour Koln has the bodies of the three wise man who brought the presents to Jesus. Mummified, i presume. Anyway, i dont know who wrote this, but its a very nice article. I'll propose it for featured. [[User:Muriel Gottrop|Muriel G]] 07:40, 4 Aug 2004 (UTC)
:Ah, but there is above complete neglect of the significance of non-corruption. If the tissue in question (eg, body, relic, ...) doesn't deteriorate, that was taken as evidence of divine intervention (&quot;must have been a saint&quot; or something), and of course, Jesus being the most divine possible (neglecting Trinitarian pinhead dancing issues), His tissue could still less possibly have deteriorated. And all the mention of floral smells associated with relics, and living and dead saints is, as nearly as I can make out, an extension of the same sort of reasoning. Rotting stuff smells, right; nice smelling stuff, especially, can't possibly be rotting. More evidence of divine something or other. 
and so must be special, ie divine or divinely preserved or something. 
::Interesting as there are only ''three'' wise men in folklore.  Biblical souces state three gifts but not the number of &quot;Magi&quot;. [[User:Dainamo|Dainamo]] 12:17, 14 Sep 2004 (UTC)

:As for JtB's 14 year old head having been preserved, there are two possibilities I can see. The first is that scripture got his dates wrong and he was much younger than everyone has thought when Salome got it lopped off and when he baptised his cousin down at the river. Or there were for a while two heads on one JtB (oddly not mentioned in scripture), one of which was removed at age 14. Salome would then have gotten the other later on. There is much which requires faith to understand about this stuff.  [[User:Ww|ww]] 15:25, 9 Aug 2004 (UTC)

== Inconsistency ==
:&quot;(removed at his circumcision, as with all other Jewish boys) would be one of the few physical remainders of Jesus left behind on Earth. It is important to note that Jewish circumcision around Jesus's time was not at all common&quot;

== References and links ==
Does the linked [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] article on relics actually mention the Holy Prepuce or any of the location which claimed the have this relic? I couldn't find any reference to the Prepuce in the Catholic Encyclopedia at all, which is surprising and notable given that it is often quite expansive on many minor topics. 

Nearly all the online references I could find appear to be either unsubstantiated, or secularist sites which were mildly antagonistic towards the Catholic church. 

The Institute of Protestant Studies link and ''Mediaeval Sexual Behaviour'' article at least gave some documented references to lend credence, but it would be good if these could be checked. 

Note there is also mention of umbilici, or the Holy Umbilical Cord, being a relic, and this time there is at least one rather opaque quote regarding the umbilical cord in the [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0315.htm Catholic Encyclopedia]-- [[User:Solipsist|Solipsist]] 11:39, 6 Aug 2004 (UTC)

:You're right - I did the same search and couldn't find anything in the CE. I included that article as being pretty closely related and also because I was concerned about the primary link being to the Institute of Protestant Studies - it has references, as you say, but it's pretty vehemently anti-Catholic. Still looking for better sources. Incidentally, [[Voltaire]] referred to the Holy Foreskin - I'll add info on this soon. --[[User:ALargeElk|ALargeElk]] | [[User talk:ALargeElk|Talk]] 12:00, 6 Aug 2004 (UTC)

::Yes I also saw one reference to someone quoting [[Voltaire]] but it looked fairly dubious. If you can find a direct quote, that would be good.

The [http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Oracle/2588/page2.htm current version] of the page has most of the content removed  and suggests it may be coming out in a book, but the relvant passage from the cached version is;
:::''Gregory IX who became pope in 1227, was persecuting his adversaries with relentless ferocity. ..... For some reason the heads of Peter and Paul were kept away from the rest of their remains and were relocated in the Lateran basilica along with the Ark of the covenant, tablets of Moses, rod of Aaron, an urn of manna, the virgin's tunic, John the Baptist's shirt, the original five loaves and the two fishes from the feeding of the five thousand, and the dining table used at the last supper. In the nearby chapel of St. Lawrence the foreskin and the umbilical cord of Jesus was preserved in a bejeweled hollow crucifix filled with sacred oil.''

I'd do it myself, but it wouldn't look good coming from my work email address. Maybe tell him what we're about and ask him if he's got anything to add to the article.

==size and shape of what got sliced==
Based on [[circumcision]], [[Circumcision in the Bible]] and [[Brit milah]], my understanding is that the style of circumcision (tip v. whole foreskin) changed well before Jesus's time (i.e., during the [[Maccabean revolt]]). What changed with [[Simon bar Kokhba]] was the universality - not all Jews underwent it. So, re-editing that section. --[[User:ALargeElk|ALargeElk]] | [[User talk:ALargeElk|Talk]] 15:58, 6 Aug 2004 (UTC)
:Elk, My understanding was the reverse, though not based on any WP content. During the bar Kokhba (have seen lots of different transliterations of that!) revolt, radical circumcision became the favored style amonst the Jews as it made impossible any 'going along' with the Greek anti mutilation perspective which had led to attempts to ban circumcision by the Seleucids. Kokhba (and followers) was revolted by such attempts to violate Jewish ritual requirements. As for the universal business, it seems that many a Jew (or family) attempted to 'slide by' and satisfy both sides in the controversy. Thus, before Kokhba, some Jews were either not circumcised or circumcised in such a way as to not appear to be so and so to avoid trouble with the post Alexander authorities. That would seem to include the Maccabean period as well. 
:The comment about &quot;peri'ah&quot; at [[Circumcision in the Bible]] would appear to support this understanding of a changed meaning for the word circumcision after say 130CE as opposed to pre 130CE at least among Rabbinical Jews -- from which modern Judaism derives.
:In any case, it is my understanding that the circumcision done prior to both uprisings (eg, ca 300BCE) was not the radical style now practiced. 
:My original intent with this was merely to note that what we now (and most of the Middle Ages when all those foreskins were so carefully stored all over Europe) think of as what the kid leaves behind wasn't what was likely left behind at Jesus's circumcision. Thus stressing what is likely an anachronistic impression by all of those in charge of all those foreskins. I hadn't intended to wander afield into questions of ritual being defended by one or another Jewish uprising. Can you revise to get this across or should I? We've ended up with lots of obiter dicta as nearly as I can see. [[User:Ww|ww]] 15:10, 9 Aug 2004 (UTC)

== Ownership ==

The article makes several references to churches which claim to &quot;own&quot; the HP.   It sounds very odd to me to talk about owning part of Jesus; I know that UK law until recently held that you couldn't own parts of a human body.   I'd be happier with &quot;possess&quot;, unless someone knows better about church/continental law on the point. [[User:Markalexander100|Markalexander100]] 07:50, 10 Aug 2004 (UTC)

== Earliest Record? ==

One point of criticism concerning this article: I'd like to see when the first mention of this relic is recorded. All humor aside, the matter of celibacy was important to the early Christian Church ([[Clementine literature]] is one example of this). Some acknowledgement of this aspect would help improve this article's NPOV quality. -- [[User:Llywrch|llywrch]] 02:20, 14 Sep 2004 (UTC)

== Funny there are no sources ==

== Links ==

One of the links points to a pretty opinionated external link on Circumcision calling it an &quot;ugly&quot; &quot;genital mutilation&quot; and three is no indication it is not written in NPOV.

I am replacing it with the Wikipedia link [[Circumcision]] as it does a better job of addressing the topic.[[User:129.42.208.182|129.42.208.182]] 21:27, 14 Sep 2004 (UTC)

== Authenticity ==

A search online shows that the only source for the claim that Pope Clement VII stated that the relic was an authentic one comes from this article. Accordingly, I have deleted those claims until and unless someone provides a source stating that he did indeed declare the relic to be authentic. --[[User:Kadett|Kadett]] 21:52, 14 Sep 2004 (UTC)

When Jesus body ascended to heaven, didn't the foreskin followed it? 
[[User:Manco|Manco]] 22:09, 14 Sep 2004 (UTC)

== Query ==

&quot;A related theological issue questions whether Jesus' foreskin was restored to him in his resurrected body. The act of circumcision was a ritual of profound religious significance to Jews, and marked their membership in the covenant community. The New Testament contains extensive discussions about whether circumcision was needed for Gentile converts, and concludes that it was not; the position settled upon is that Jesus' crucifixion established a new covenant for Christians for which the rite was not necessary.&quot; Considering that most Christians believe that Jesus is God come to earth and has fulfilled the law, would we be right to mention Colossians 2:9-15? - [[User:Ta bu shi da yu|Ta bu shi da yu]] 07:39, 26 Sep 2004 (UTC)


== Wedding Ring? ==
My girlfriend, who has taken master's-level courses on religious history in Europe, says that although [[Catherine of Siena]] was indeed allegorically married to Jesus, the foreskin-as-wedding-ring concept is from an anti-Catholic parody written centuries later.

''Since [[Vatican II]], the emphasis placed on relics by the Catholic Church has declined markedly, with many relics with long traditions being relegated to &quot;pious legend&quot; by the [[Holy See|Vatican]]. Interest in the Holy Foreskin has been specifically downplayed, with the observation that this particular relic encouraged 'irreverent curiosity'.''

No refrence attached, and this statement smelled false to me.  I've been to many churches, in Europe and the USA, and there was an abundance of relics, with people venerating them and the like.  At any rate, it needs a source. [[User:Lostcaesar|Lostcaesar]] 20:16, 9 July 2006 (UTC)

Vatican II and related reforms officially struck off a large number of ancient relics and saints from the record, rendering them &quot;dubious&quot;. The calendar, for example, was drastically pared down in the number of saint's days; affected churches were understandably irritated, and many continue to venerate the relics they house, and the saints they are dedicated to, but this does not mean that the &quot;saints&quot; are still regarded as saints by the official church heirarchy.

== The rings of Saturn - hoax?==

I've removed this paragraph, as well as the corresponding one from the [[Leo Allatius]] article:

&quot;During the late 17th century, Catholic scholar and theologian Leo Allatius in  ''De Praeputio Domini Nostri Jesu Christi Diatriba'' (''&quot;Discussion concerning the Prepuce of our Lord Jesus Christ&quot;'') speculated that the Holy Foreskin may have ascended into Heaven at the same time as Jesus himself and might have become the rings of Saturn, then only recently observed by telescope.&quot;

Neither of the external links for Allatius mention such a theory, and I have a feeling it could be a hoax. It's mentioned on various blogs, but they're probably sourced from Wikipedia.--&lt;strong&gt;[[User:Nydas|Nydas]]&lt;/strong&gt;[[User talk:Nydas|&lt;sup&gt;(Talk)&lt;/sup&gt;]] 09:12, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

It's far from an urban legend.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Shackleton7|Shackleton7]] ([[User talk:Shackleton7|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Shackleton7|contribs]]) 20:51, 5 April 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== You have to wonder... ==

During the middle ages, where did the alleged owners of the holy prepuce get all those foreskins?  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/71.64.133.238|71.64.133.238]] ([[User talk:71.64.133.238|talk]]) 19:20, 12 July 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Stoke on Trent ==
I'm querying the existence of a Holy Foreskin in Stoke on Trent. Now that's a sentence I never thought I'd be writing... but be that as it may: I've chased the links, and nowhere is SoT mentioned. Everywhere else in the list seems to check out OK in the Slate article and elsewhere; however, Googling reveals only the WP article and fairly obvious derivatives thereof.

I'm not denying that there may well be relics in SoT, but something about this reference is pinging my sneaky-vandalism detector. I may be wrong - in fact, I'd be delighted to be proven wrong - but I'd like a reputable citation before I'll believe it.

:Ditto for Newport, too. I missed it the first time around, vaguely thinking that it was one of those French places with English names left over from when England owned chunks of northern France, and didn't click the link to check - sorry for that.

==Article scope==
I've created [[Circumcision of Jesus]] which is designed to cover the historical, art historical, and theological aspects of the circumcision of Jesus. I think I'm going to move some of the content of this article there, and leave this article to describe the actual relics.

== Problematic references ==

Most of the article appears to be taken from articles by David Farley, a journalist who published a book on the subject. Most sources found elsewhere were anti-catholic websites, needless to say non of those qualify as RS. I suspect much of this article's content linked to Catholic oppression of this tradition to be modern urban legends.--&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14px; text-shadow: grey 0.1em 0.1em 0.1em;&quot;&gt;'''[[user:Rafy|&lt;font color=&quot;#4B088A&quot;&gt;'''R'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#5F04B4&quot;&gt;'''a'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#8000FF&quot;&gt;'''f'''&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#BE81F7&quot;&gt;'''y'''&lt;/font&gt;]]''' &lt;small&gt;[[User_talk:Rafy|talk]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 13:30, 15 October 2012 (UTC)</text>
