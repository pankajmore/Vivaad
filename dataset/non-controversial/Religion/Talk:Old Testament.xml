== Relationship with [[Tanakh]] ==

Shouldn't this page be redirected to the one on [[:Tanach|Tanach]], and this material added there? There are many Wikipedia pages that are unnecessary duplicates, like this one, and the ones on [[Go (board game)|Go]]/[[:Pente|Pente]] and the ones on [[:Jehovah|Jehovah]]/[[:Yahweh|Yahweh]]. [[User:RK|RK]]

I would say not. The view that the Tanakh and the Old Testament are the same is a very Christian view, not supported by most Jewish people I know. The discussion on [[:Communion|Communion]], the Lord's Supper, the Last Supper, and the Eucharist, clearly pointed out an advantage of '''Wiki is not paper'''.

: I don't follow this; there must be some linguistic confusion here. For a few sentences here and there, Jews and Christians disagree over the text - but for the vast majority of the text, over 99% of it - they agree that it is precisely the same thing. Is this debate over a few sentences here and there what those Jewish people you know were referring to? Or do they believe that Christians added entire new books to the Hebrew Bible? Chrisitians, in fact, did not do this. But they did add the New Testament and Apocrypha; however, Chrisitians have never claimed that these books are part of the Old Testament/Tanach. [[User:RK|RK]]

:You're right, they did not, RK. We need to decide what to do with different terms for similar rites and liturgical phenomena. I do agree that in this case there is little difference. However I still think it should have two entries, or at least a double title. Someone familiar with Christianity will no doubt have trouble finding the Old Testament under 'Tanach'. The case of Eucharist/Communion as I see it deserves two separate entries, since the liturgical practice of each version of the 'Last Supper' and the theological doctrines behind them differ significantly, and could each probably be regarded typical of Roman Catholicism and of Protestantism.--TK
----
Could someone tell me more about which Christian scholars think the New Testament doesn't apply to Jews and why? Clearly Jews would think it doesn't apply to them, but the New Testament authors were mostly Jews, if not all of them, and their audiences clearly included both Jews and Gentiles. This is especially obvious in the Gospel according to St. Matthew and the Epistle to the Hebrews. I don't mind including that view here, but it would be helpful to include the rationale as well, I would think. --[[User:Wesley|Wesley]]
----
As I had never heard of the &quot;Tanach&quot; until coming here, the idea that it is identical with the Old Testament is certainly new to me. It would have been impossible for someone like myself, who is rather well-read in a variety of subjects, including the bible, to find the Old Testament if there were only an entry labeled &quot;Tanach&quot;. -- Zoe

-----
Ok, enough back and forth. Regarding the Old Testament and the Jewish canon, I would agree based on what others have written in the [[Biblical canon]] article that the Jewish canon did not change in the second century, simply because it had not been formally discussed and approved until then, around the time of the Council of Jamnia if I'm not mistaken. Before that time, it's clear that many Jews used the Septuagint, and that most extant manuscripts of the Septuagint include part or all of the books generally called Deuterocanonical or Apocryphal. When the Jews did officially designate a canon, it was of course based on Hebrew manuscripts that did not include these books. Would not those Jews and synagogues who discontinued use of the Septuagint in favor of Hebrew manuscripts, not also at least informally have discontinued use of the Deuterocanonical books? Or am I reading into history something that didn't happen?

The larger point is that I think this article should avoid saying that the Jewish Tanach as used today is synonymous with the Christian Old Testament. For the first 1,500 years of its history, the Christian Church included the 'deuterocanonical' books in its Old Testament; the Tanach corresponds only to the Protestant Old Testament which has those books removed. The two canons are still very similar, but they are not identical. [[User:Wesley|Wesley]] 04:23 Oct 29, 2002 (UTC)

:I see no reason to assume that the Jews used the same manuscripts for the septuagint as non-Jews. Perhaps not all books were part of the original septuagint and additional books were translated separately into Greek and incorporated without note into the non-Jewish version. [[User:Ezra Wax|Ezra Wax]]

:: Well, the reason to assume it is that AFAIK there aren't any septuagint manuscripts that correspond to the Tanach canon, although some manuscripts omit a couple of books that others contain, like IV Maccabees or the 151st Psalm. However, some differences like the prayers in the book of Esther or the Song of the Three Youths in the book of Daniel are interspersed with the main text, and (in my purely amateur opinion) unlikely to have been translated separately. Is there any particular reason or evidence to suppose there were separate 'jewish' and 'non-jewish' versions of the septuagint? But I should probably do some additional research and see whether the scholars who study these things have a more informed opinion. [[User:Wesley|Wesley]]

----

This paragraph is quite problematic:

:''The Christian Old Testament, for the most part, is identical to the Tanach. The first difference encountered is that they have a slightly different order of books. The second major difference is that the Christian Old Testament also includes many books that have extra paragraphs that do not exist in the Jewish version of the Bible. This is because the Christian Old Testament comes from the [[Septuagint]], while the Jewish Tanach draws from a similar, but distinct textual tradition.''

I have no problem for the first difference; however, there are major difficulties (mainly failure of nuance and precision) in the second difference. For one, the base text of the O.T. for Protestants is '''not''' the Septuagint (LXX) as implied in the article, but the Hebrew Massoretic text. Eastern Orthodoxy still uses the LXX, and the article should also incorporate the Roman Catholic position as well. [[User:Stephen C. Carlson|SCCarlson]] 01:11 May 11, 2003 (UTC)

== Walter Görlitz edit-warring and not understanding that he does not own any article ==

Instead of responding to what I wrote on his talk, and to the actual points, this character just rudely and arrogantly reverts AGAIN, with no real explanation, or discussion, even though I said on his talk to take to article talk first.  

This is what I wrote:

Not sure what you're problem is, but if you think I'd ever put up with what you just did, rudely and arrogantly, you're sadly and sorrily mistaken. You don't own any article, yet you're acting as if you do. You just reverted good-faith and accurate modifications, with NO real explanation, but this nonsense of &quot;unsupported changes&quot;. Without explaining just how they're unsupported. WP policy and recommendation (if one bothers to read the policy on this) is that you DON'T revert, if it's accurate, sourced, and good faith. Which my edits were. Unless you're maybe referring to that I did not put any real comment in the edit, or explanation. Maybe I should have, but that's not a good enough reason to just hastily revert something. But your front argument of &quot;unsupported changes&quot; is bogus, to be frank, as everything I put in is either supported or just more neutral in tone. So I'll take em one by one.

I put:

&quot;Bible as an affirmation of the oneness and supremacy of the God of Israel,&quot;

before it was:

&quot;bible as an affirmation of the oneness of God,&quot;

You'll notice that the word &quot;bible&quot; before was not capitalized, which is NOT correct. And also, my addition here was &quot;supremacy&quot;. Now tell me...just HOW is &quot;supremacy&quot; in this context &quot;unsupported&quot;? And also the words &quot;of Israel&quot; that I added. Or is it you just removed that stuff along with the &quot;Septuagint&quot; modification, without carefully considering everything, because you maybe kinda think you own this &quot;Old Testament&quot; article? And can dismiss any change or modification that you think is unnecessary or that you just don't like? It aint happening... Seriously. Because attitudes and actions like yours would discourage &quot;bold&quot; editing, which is simply not cool or right.

Here was my other edit, that you just hastily got rid of for no good reason

&quot;It is believed that Hellenised Jews who produced the Septuagint consistently translated this as kyrios, meaning &quot;Lord&quot;. This is seen by many as a crucial change of meaning: Yahweh, the national god of the Israelites, became the universal Lord.[1]&quot;

and the way that previously was:

&quot;The Hellenised Jews who produced the Septuagint consistently translated this as kyrios, meaning &quot;Lord&quot;. This is seen as a crucial change of meaning: Yahweh, the national god of the Israelites, became the universal Lord.[2]&quot;

The change I put was &quot;It is believed that the Hennized Jews&quot;. Why did I put it like that? Because not all believe that the original Septuagint lacked the Tetragrammaton. There was some evidence in the 1960s that the original Septuagint contained the divine name in Hebrew characters inserted in the Greek text. For real. But even so, the NPVO tone would be &quot;it is believed&quot;, instead of stating at as dogmatic fact, as there's not 1000% consensus on that anyway.

Also I put the word &quot;many&quot; in the other sentence, where it originally said &quot;This is seen&quot;. I simply put the word &quot;many&quot; as in &quot;This is seen by many&quot;. Because, again, the majority may have that view, but not necessarily every single Bible scholar or historian. If you have a problem with this, the WP policy is to modify not necessarily to completely remove. You honestly thought that I would put those edits, only for you to remove them completely a few hours later, because you seem to have a certain bias about some matters, or whatever the reason is, with me just taking it? And not simply reverting you for doing that? (From your edit history, I can see that you like reverting things you don't like.) Please bring this to the article talk, before doing anything, because you'll be edit-waring if you don't do that first.

Again, the first thing I added was totally correct and &quot;supported&quot;, the point about &quot;supremacy&quot; (and not just &quot;oneness&quot;) and &quot;of Israel&quot;. No reason to remove that. As, to repeat, you have no business removing or reverting things simply because &quot;you don't like it&quot; or would prefer it another way. It's all supported, and the other thing I did was for more neutral tone. Otherwise please discuss it further on article Talk. Regards. Hashem sfarim (talk) 00:22, 4 March 2012 (UTC)
: Odd. I just responded after you did. Sorry. I didn't see this. I think I've answered your concerns below: you are changing the meaning of references and don't have any [[WP:RS]]. Sorry you feel it's an edit war, when it's you who are in violation of policy and more importantly, logic. --[[User:Walter Görlitz|Walter Görlitz]] ([[User talk:Walter Görlitz|talk]]) 02:26, 4 March 2012 (UTC)

::You didn't really address specifically my response below, about how &quot;supremacy&quot; even if the exact word is not in that exact reference does not mean that the thought or drift is not supported overall.  Not sure if WP policy demands that precise words (if the basic point is still there and not contradicted at all in the ref) be there.  It seems to be a bit stickler-ish.  Regards. [[User:Hashem sfarim|Hashem sfarim]] ([[User talk:Hashem sfarim|talk]]) 02:34, 4 March 2012 (UTC)
::: Sorry, &quot;supremacy&quot; is not in the reference. If you want to show the supremacy of YHWH, you'll need a new sentence and reference. I did address that. --[[User:Walter Görlitz|Walter Görlitz]] ([[User talk:Walter Görlitz|talk]]) 02:41, 4 March 2012 (UTC)

== Hashem sfarim's additions ==

Let's look at Hashem sfarim's edits that he reverted. &quot;[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Old_Testament&amp;diff=479989502&amp;oldid=479783761 minor elab...] &quot;capitalized Bible, which is fully supported by [[WP:MOSCAPS]], but changing that phrase to &quot;oneness '''and supremacy''' of '''the''' God '''of Israel'''&quot; is not supported by the reference. If you want to add that somewhere else, feel free to do so, but find a reference for it. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Old_Testament&amp;diff=479990161&amp;oldid=479989502 This] edit similarly changes &quot;The&quot; to &quot;It is believed that&quot;, which isn't supported by the reference (or the facts). It was the Hellenized Jews who produced the LXX, and they translated YHWH to ''kyrios'', which is of course supported by a reference. Finally, [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Old_Testament&amp;diff=479990275&amp;oldid=479990161 is] just adding a [[WP:WEASEL]] WORD, but again is changing a referenced point (one that I disagree with personally).

So perhaps next time, instead of lashing-out at another editor, you can [[WP:AGF|assume good faith]] and follow the [[WP:BRD|Bold, Revert, Discuss]] cycle and take the conversation to the talk page instead. --[[User:Walter Görlitz|Walter Görlitz]] ([[User talk:Walter Görlitz|talk]]) 01:28, 4 March 2012 (UTC)

:The problem with your argument is that you think that because the very word &quot;supremacy&quot; may not have been on the actual specific source that (per stickler wiki hyper lawyering which runs too rampant with some editors on WP) that therefore the DRIFT of the word is not supported.  No.  WP policy does not call for every single jot and tittle to be necessarily in the reference, as long as arguably the overall thought is there.  You'll say that in that reference or any reference in the article the point of &quot;supremacy&quot; is not there?     As far as the &quot;believed by many&quot; for the Septuagint, your bias shows again, because you said &quot;(or the facts&quot;.  That's simply not true if you bothered to actually read what I wrote at first in your talk page, which you obviously dodged, by quickly blanking it.   There's been evidence to show that the Hebrew Tetragrammaton was inserted in the Septuagint, in Hebrew Characters, in the Greek text.  Not a well-known fact, but still a fact.  And yeah, admittedly better if a ref was put in for that.  But I did not actually state those words, but simply &quot;it is believed by many&quot;, which happens to be more NPOV and true.  (Regarding &quot;many believing&quot; that the Tetramgram was replaced.) Not all necessarily believe that the original Septuagint lacked the Tetragram, in Hebrew characters.  So I said &quot;many&quot;. (As regards to &quot;many believing that the Tetragram was somehow forever replaced by the generic title &quot;Lord&quot;.)  Just because you don't know about that OR DON'T LIKE THAT FACT, does not mean there's no fact or support for it.  Yes, you're right that it's not in that specific reference, but you'll notice that I did not say &quot;inserted in Greek text&quot; anywhere in my modification, but simply said &quot;believed by many&quot; etc, which is arguably supported in drift by the source, and is simply more NPOV.  Which you obviously don't like.  But the thing with &quot;supremacy&quot; to remove was ridiculous, because of the argument that that specific word not being in that specific ref.  Even if the basic drift or thought is there. Meaning, that if one is honest, the modifications that were put in COULD have been left, theoretically, even if the exact word was not in ref per se.  Will you argue that the &quot;supremacy&quot; point is in ''contradiction'' to the specific ref? [[User:Hashem sfarim|Hashem sfarim]] ([[User talk:Hashem sfarim|talk]]) 01:36, 4 March 2012 (UTC)

:: The problem with your argument is that you're changing the meaning of referenced material. Period. If you want to add your &lt;s&gt;opinion&lt;/s&gt; material follow [[WP:RS]]. I have no bias, sorry, you have [[WP:WEASEL]] words. As for the insertion of YHWH into LXX in Hebrew, if it's a fact, it should be added, with a [[WP:RS]], until then, don't change the referenced information. Add a counter-claim with your reference. It's not what I like, it's what's in the source. I won't argue anything, only support it with a RS.

::Again, I never said in my actual edit that the Tetragram was inserted in the Greek text.  I never stated that in the modification.  All I put was the word &quot;many&quot; and &quot;it is believed&quot;. (In regard to the notion that the Septuagint apparently never even had the Tetragram in it, and that somehow &quot;Lord&quot; was now the only word to ever use, as if the Septuagint was infallible...though that's another topic.)  

::But all I put was &quot;many believe&quot; so and so.  THAT WAS IT.  And you claim that is so &quot;weaselish&quot;, when arguably all it is was ''more neutral and objective sounding'', and less dogmatic sounding.  That's all that was meant by that.   I tried to make it more NPOV.   That's how I meant it.  So who is assuming &quot;bad faith&quot; here??    So what I mean, by what kind of person you are?   You get annoyed if someone seems to accuse YOU of &quot;bad faith&quot; or &quot;bias&quot;, yet it's ok for you to IMMEDIATELY assume that about me and my minor modification.  Not cool and not fair.  Again, to repeat, in the actual edit, I never even put that in there, if you notice, about &quot;Hebrew Tetragram inserted in Septuagint&quot;.   

::It was only the word &quot;many&quot; and &quot;many believe&quot;, regarding &quot;many believe&quot; the Tetragram was never there and was somehow forever replaced by the generic title &quot;Lord&quot;.  &quot;Many believe&quot; that.  Which uh happens to be a simple fact.  (Not every single scholar or historian on the planet believes this notion about the current Septuagint copies we still have lacking the Tetragram therefore meaning &quot;Lord&quot; replaced &quot;Jehovah&quot; permanently.  Not everyone buys that conclusion. ''Not all scholars and historians necessarily agree with that''.) 

::As far as the ref, not sure if that specific ref says &quot;this is viewed by everyone.&quot;  It's dangerous to state things like this as dogmatic unquestionable totally-agreed-upon &quot;fact&quot;, when they actually aren't.   Not all Biblical Scholars and Linguists buy this notion about YHVH etc.  So please spare me this uptight thing already.   I already let this go a couple of hours ago.  I've moved on.   It's whatever.  You obviously have taken control of this article, and want everything scrupulously sourced within each syllable.  That's your thing, fine.  I don't care that much anymore.  

::Again, I just put the word &quot;many believe&quot; which you assume bad faith as &quot;weasel-ish&quot;, instead of an honest attempt to make it more NPOV sounding. Regards. [[User:Hashem sfarim|Hashem sfarim]] ([[User talk:Hashem sfarim|talk]]) 05:03, 4 March 2012 (UTC)

::: No. In your actual edit you never said anything about the Tetragramaton, you simply added the weasel words &quot;It is believed that&quot; when the reference states this as a fact and added &quot;by many&quot; which is more weasel words. It's not making it more neutral, it's adding weasel words. While you meant it one way, it came across as another. I never assumed that it's in bad faith. Do not ever put words in my mouth again. It is a weasel word. Go read some of the policies and guidelines I've pointed you to. I have not taken control of this article because I've reverted your edits, I am applying policies and guidelines here as I do in other locations. Don't confuse the two and do assume good faith. I did when I reverted your changes, however, when an edit changes the meaning of a reference and adds weasel words, it has to be reverted. However, you should not assume that because someone reverts your edits that you are being singled-out for some special punishment. If you have simple facts you may add those facts, with reliable sources as references, but do not edit an existing referenced statement. --[[User:Walter Görlitz|Walter Görlitz]] ([[User talk:Walter Görlitz|talk]]) 05:25, 4 March 2012 (UTC)

Sometimes it's case by case.  I mean, goodness, the way that particular paragraph is worded, it's stated as dogmatic hard unquestionable &quot;fact&quot;.  Which WP is not really supposed to do.  Especially in matters like this!  You honestly think that every Biblicist and Linguist buys this nonsense that because current copies of the Septuagint lack the Tetragram, that that negates the original Hebrew, that ''does'' contain the Tetragram over 6000 times?  Or that somehow because of the Septuagint that therefore it means the generic &quot;Lord&quot; replaced the Memorial Name of &quot;Jehovah&quot; forever?  Also, as I said, a not-widely-known fact is that some evidence has been uncovered (lol) that shows that the ORIGINAL &quot;Septuagint&quot; actually had the Tetragram inserted in Hebrew characters IN the Greek text.  And did you know that Wikipedia itself states this? lol.   Right [[Septuagint manuscripts#Greek Septuagint manuscripts with Hebrew YHWH|here]].  The point is this, the current wording right now (regardless of whether you agree or not) in that specific paragraph has a bit of a POV tone in it, and is too dogmatic.

::I'm well aware of the policy.  Don't think I have not read the stuff you have, because I have.  And I already know that edit warring can be without 3RR.  Which is why I said (if you recall, or if you had read what I wrote on your talk page originally) to go to Talk before reverting, because it would be edit-warring if you don't do that first.  And I know that was not 3RR yet.  So I'm fully aware that edit-warring can be other ways in general.  But going beyond 3RR (as we all know) is just a clearer &quot;bright line&quot;.  I try hard never to do that.  Regards... [[User:Hashem sfarim|Hashem sfarim]] ([[User talk:Hashem sfarim|talk]]) 07:35, 4 March 2012 (UTC)

::: I was edit warring: &quot;a series of back-and-forth reverts&quot;. Yes?
::: You were edit warring too based on that definition. Yes?
::: &quot;Even without a 3RR violation, an administrator may still act if they believe a user's behavior constitutes edit warring&quot;. Yes?
::: Good night. If you get the time, please respond to my question above, if you're interested in continuing the conversation. --[[User:Walter Görlitz|Walter Görlitz]] ([[User talk:Walter Görlitz|talk]]) 07:47, 4 March 2012 (UTC)

::::In fact I misread Hashem's first edits, he is at 2RR, you are at 3RR as your first reversion was about 19 hours ago. Glad to see you all are trying to talk it out. [[User:Dougweller|Dougweller]] ([[User talk:Dougweller|talk]]) 09:11, 4 March 2012 (UTC)

== Table used in the Content section ==

I just revised the table since the previous one didn't wrap well on larger monitors. I think it would be a better idea to use a sorting table and list the books in the left column and then have the MT be the second column and we could indicate in which section of the Tanakh the book appears, if at all, and do the same for the LXX. We would also remove the notes from the table and make them true notes that appear at the bottom. I would also think that Wikilinking to the article on the book would be appropriate. --[[User:Walter Görlitz|Walter Görlitz]] ([[User talk:Walter Görlitz|talk]]) 21:36, 2 April 2012 (UTC)

== Islamic views on Old Testament ==

I think that Islamic standpoint is missing, especially given that the Christian one is given. I am not an expert on this, but I think some points would be:

- fulfillment of Jeremiah's prophesy through Muhammad and Quran 

- commonness/similarities of some stories  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Sirinsirine|Sirinsirine]] ([[User talk:Sirinsirine|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sirinsirine|contribs]]) 20:11, 12 September 2012 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;
: But the Old Testament is a Christian document. The Jewish version is the [[Tanakh]] or [[Hebrew Bible]]. Is either regularly used in Islam? If it isn't and we add this view, then it opens up the permission for other world religions which makes no sense. I suppose if it's added to those other articles, it could be added here. --[[User:Walter Görlitz|Walter Görlitz]] ([[User talk:Walter Görlitz|talk]]) 20:23, 12 September 2012 (UTC)
:: Tawrat (thought to correspond to Torah), Injil (thought to correspond to gospel) and Zabur (thought to correspond to possibly to psalms) are regarded in Islam as word of God, but believed to have been changed by people. Because they are changed, they cannot be regarded as a reliable source for Islamic theology, but they are still sometimes referred to, for example, when only small details of a story are provided in Quran (though some stories differ as well). 

::While you might be right about not direct connection, there are no other major Abrahamic religions apart from Christianity, Judaism and Islam and Quran has lots of common points to the older books. [[User:Sirinsirine|Sirinsirine]] ([[User talk:Sirinsirine|talk]]) 20:30, 13 September 2012 (UTC)
::: You evaded the question. Are the books of the Old Testament regularly used in Islam? If not, it doesn't matter what Islam thinks.
::: Also, my original point was that there are three articles about the collection of works Christians call the &quot;Old Testament&quot; and you have to look at all of them to understand the request you're making and why it's not even remotely reasonable let alone feasible.
::: Finally, there's no section on what Christianity and Judaism have to say about the Koran so why should the readers of these three articles care about Islam has to say about this document? For the record, I could show you several books that discuss the inconsistencies and outright mistakes in the Koran. --[[User:Walter Görlitz|Walter Görlitz]] ([[User talk:Walter Görlitz|talk]]) 20:42, 13 September 2012 (UTC)

:::: Well, I have already stated the extent to which old testament is used. To be more precise, an example is translation of Quran into Turkish by for example Suat Yildirim: it uses some quotes from Old/New Testaments. Parts of Old Testement being regarded as in some sense word of God in Islam makes it worth of mention in this article in my opinion.

:::: Furthermore, testaments books are predating Quran, so obviously they cannot (at least directly) comment on it. If you are aware of such mention, then it should be added to the article about Quran, people would have a right to know that. Main point is that if there are different version of one story in different books, a universal encyclopedia should make a mention of that. These books are telling different versions of the same stories and similar ideas.

:::: I do not see the relation of possible inconsistencies in Quran to the topic (even though I personally have not seen an acceptable demonstration from any source that claims to show them, but that's not our topic here). [[User:Sirinsirine|Sirinsirine]] ([[User talk:Sirinsirine|talk]]) 13:28, 14 September 2012 (UTC)

::::: By used I mean during Friday prayers.
::::: The fact that the Koran mentions this document does not give the religion founded on that book to comment on it.
::::: The only reason I mention mistakes and errors, not simply inconsistencies in the Koran, is that that is what I would have to add to the article on that book to maintain [[WP:BALANCE]] in the way you're suggesting should be done here. --[[User:Walter Görlitz|Walter Görlitz]] ([[User talk:Walter Görlitz|talk]]) 14:35, 14 September 2012 (UTC)

:::::: It seems I am stressing commonness rather than usage as opposed to you. If there was substantial mention of material in the Old Testament in the ancient Egyptian texts, than that should have been included as well. So rather than practice issue, this is a commenness and reference issue. Maybe I should have named this discussion as relation to Quran rather than Islam (though it does directly shape the viewpoint of Islam). This is encyclopedic knowledge in my view.
:::::: Friday prayers consist of salah (and that definitely would not include parts of Old Testament) and a talk to congragation, which may include parts but does not have to, and mostly won't include. (For information, Friday prayers are not the most common prayer type performed by Muslims). Still, I don't think this is of any crucial importance. The stress is on the similarity of the parts/stories/... of these books.
:::::: I still cannot see any relation of some possible inconsistencies to [[WP:BALANCE]], completely different statements... [[User:Sirinsirine|Sirinsirine]] ([[User talk:Sirinsirine|talk]]) 15:10, 14 September 2012 (UTC)

{{outdent|::::::}} Returning to your original point: &quot;I think that Islamic standpoint is missing, especially given that the Christian one is given&quot;. The reason &quot;the Christian one is given&quot; is that this is a Christian document. That's what I was saying by referencing the Tanakh and Hebrew Bible articles. This isn't an opinion of the Tanakh, it is used in regular worship of Christians, which is why it has its own article. Its use and selection of material has a separate history. In some cases the numbering of books and verses is different. The fact that the original document was translated into Greek and that Greek document was quoted by writers of the New Testament is mentioned. The decision by the early church fathers as to which books to include and which to exclude is discussed. This article and the collection of books it is related to is not an interpretation (or misinterpretation as sources related to the Koran's view of it would show) of the Tanakh, it's actually a document that is part of the foundation of Christianity. If you would like to start a new article related to Islamic views of Hebrew and Christian scriptures feel free to. --[[User:Walter Görlitz|Walter Görlitz]] ([[User talk:Walter Görlitz|talk]]) 15:16, 14 September 2012 (UTC)
: I still think commenness should be stressed, but given this is a short article, I think it also make sense to for example to restrict on inclduing into &quot;see also&quot; for example this link
