Separation of powers The separation of powers, often imprecisely used
interchangeably with the trias politica principle, is a model for the
governance of a state (or who controls the state). The model was first
developed in the Roman Republic as part of the unmodified Constitution of the
Roman Republic. Under this model, the state is divided into branches, each with
separate and independent powers and areas of responsibility so that no branch
has more power than the other branches. The normal division of branches is into
a legislature, an executive, and a judiciary. Montesquieu's tripartite system.
The term is ascribed to French Enlightenment political philosopher Baron de
Montesquieu. Montesquieu described division of political power among a
legislature, an executive, and a judiciary. He based this model on the British
constitutional system, in which he perceived a separation of powers among the
monarch, Parliament, and the courts of law. Subsequent writers have noted that
this was misleading, because the United Kingdom had a very closely connected
legislature and executive, with further links to the judiciary (though combined
with judicial independence). Montesquieu did specify that "the independence of
the judiciary has to be real, and not apparent merely". "The judiciary was
generally seen as the most important of powers, independent and unchecked", and
also considered it dangerous. Comparison between Presidential and Parliamentary
systems. In democratic systems of governance based on the trias politica, a
fundamental parallel and a fundamental difference exists between "presidential
systems" and constitutional monarchic "parliamentary system" of government. The
parallel is that the three branches of government (legislative, executive,
judicial) exist largely independent of each other, with their own prerogatives,
domains of activity, and exercises of control over each other. Two-branch power
systems may have systems in which certain branches have more than one power.
Often a legislative body is elected, while the executive is nominated. The
nominated executive branch also has power of presenting legislation, while the
legislative body only has a controlling function. In those systems, the
judiciary is subservient to the executive and has no power to control either
the executive or the legality of new legislative texts. The separation of
powers is a doctrine which provides a separate authority that makes it possible
for the authorities to check each other's checks and balances (see United
States Executive Authority Act 1936). Various models. Constitutions with a high
degree of separation of powers are found worldwide. The UK system is
distinguished by a particular entwining of powers. In Italy the powers are
completely separated, even if Council of Ministers need the vote of confidence
from both chambers of Parliament, that's however formed by a wide number of
members (almost 1,000). A number of Latin American countries have electoral
branches of government. Countries with little separation of power include New
Zealand and Canada. Canada makes limited use of separation of powers in
practice, although in theory it distinguishes between branches of government.
New Zealand also subscribes to the principle of 'Separation of Powers' through
a series of constitutional safeguards. The Executive requires regular approval
from the Legislature to carry out decisions. The Mixed Members Proportionate
framework also caters for a coalition of parties to form government where a
majority from a single party does not exist. The Judiciary is also free of
government interference. If a series of judicial decisions result in an
interpretation of the law which the Executive considers does not reflect the
intention of the policy, the Executive can change the legislation. However,
they can not direct or request a judicial officer to revise or reconsider a
decision. These decisions are final. Should there be a dispute between the
Executive and Judiciary, the Executive has no authority to direct the
Judiciary, or its individual members. Complete separation-of-powers systems are
almost always presidential, although theoretically this need not be the case.
There are a few historical exceptions, such as the Directoire system of
revolutionary France. Switzerland offers an example of non-Presidential
separation of powers today: It is run by a seven-member executive branch, the
Federal Council. However, some might argue that Switzerland does not have a
strong separation of powers system, as the Federal Council is appointed by
parliament (but not dependent on parliament), and the judiciary has no power of
review. Three branches. Australia. Australia does not maintain a strict
separation between the legislative and executive branches of
government‚Äîindeed, government ministers are required to be a member of
parliament‚Äîbut the federal judiciary strictly guards its independence from
the other two branches. However, under influence from the American
constitution, the Australian constitution does define the three branches of
government separately, and this has been interpreted by the judiciary to induce
an implicit separation of powers. State governments have a similar level of
separation of power, but this is generally on the basis of convention, rather
than constitution. Hong Kong. The Chief Executive, elected by a 1200-member
Election Committee, is both head of the region and head of government, and
chairs the Executive Council which is composed of unofficial members and
government secretaries. The law courts exercise the power of judicial review of
constitutionality of legislation and administrative actions, and emphasize the
separation of powers in their rulings. The Chief Justice also stated this
position in the ceremonial opening of the 2010 legal year. However, politically
separation of powers is usually argued against, with the leaders of the
People's Republic of China and supportive politicians publicly requesting for
the three branches to cooperate and emphasizing an "executive-led" system.
India. India follows a parliamentary system of government, which offers a clear
separation of powers. The judiciary branch is fairly independent of the other
two branches. Executive powers are vested with the President and Prime
Minister, who are assisted by the Cabinet Secretary and other Secretaries. All
three branches have "checks and balances" over each other to maintain the
balance of POWER. United Kingdom. The development of the British constitution,
which is not a codified document, is based on this fusion in the person of the
Monarch, who has a formal role to play in the legislature (Parliament, which is
where legal and political sovereignty lies, is the Crown-in-Parliament, and is
summoned and dissolved by the Sovereign who must give his or her Royal Assent
to all Bills so that they become Acts), the executive (the Sovereign appoints
all ministers of His/Her Majesty's Government, who govern in the name of the
Crown) and the judiciary (the Sovereign, as the fount of justice, appoints all
senior judges, and all public prosecutions are brought in his or her name).
Although the doctrine of separation of power plays a role in the United
Kingdom's constitutional doctrine, the UK constitution is often described as
having "a weak separation of powers" A. V. Dicey, despite its constitution
being the one to which Montesquieu originally referred. For example, in the
United Kingdom, the executive forms a subset of the legislature, as did‚Äîto a
lesser extent‚Äîthe judiciary until the establishment of the Supreme Court of
the United Kingdom. The Prime Minister, the Chief Executive, sits as a member
of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, either as a peer in the House of Lords
or as an elected member of the House of Commons (by convention, and as a result
of the supremacy of the Lower House, the Prime Minister now sits in the House
of Commons) and can effectively be removed from office by a simple majority
vote. Furthermore, while the courts in the United Kingdom are undoubtedly
amongst the most independent in the world, the Law Lords, who were the final
arbiters of judicial disputes in the UK sat simultaneously in the House of
Lords, the upper house of the legislature, although this arrangement ceased in
2009 when the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom came into existence.
Furthermore, because of the existence of Parliamentary sovereignty, while the
theory of separation of powers may be studied there, a system such as that of
the UK is more accurately described as a "fusion of powers". Until 2005, the
Lord Chancellor fused the Legislature, Executive and Judiciary, as he was the
ex officio Speaker of the House of Lords, a Government Minister who sat in
Cabinet and was head of the Lord Chancellor's Department which administered the
courts, the justice system and appointed judges, and was the head of the
Judiciary in England and Wales and sat as a judge on the Judicial Committee of
the House of Lords, the highest domestic court in the entire United Kingdom,
and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, the senior tribunal court for
parts of the Commonwealth. The Lord Chancellor also had certain other judicial
positions, including being a judge in the Court of Appeal and President of the
Chancery Division. The Lord Chancellor combines other aspects of the
constitution, including having certain ecclesiastical functions of the
established state church, making certain church appointments, nominations and
sitting as one of the thirty-three Church Commissioners. These functions remain
intact and unaffected by the Constitutional Reform Act. In 2005, the
Constitutional Reform Act separated the powers with Legislative functions going
to an elected Lord Speaker and the Judicial functions going to the Lord Chief
Justice. The Lord Chancellor's Department was replaced with a Ministry of
Justice and the Lord Chancellor currently serves in the position of Secretary
of State for Justice. The judiciary has no power to strike down primary
legislation, and can only rule on secondary legislation that it is invalid with
regard to the primary legislation if necessary. Under parliamentary
sovereignty, Parliament can do whatever it wants and can overrule the judiciary
and amend, repeal and introduce laws. A recent example, is when a court ruled
that it was illegal for local authority councils to hold prayers before
undertaking the council business (though part of the session) and the Secretary
of State for Communities and Local Government signed a Parliamentary Order
approved by Parliament, to overrule the court and legally allow all local
authorities to hold prayers at sessions. United States. In the United States
Constitution, Article 1 Section I gives Congress only those "legislative powers
herein granted" and proceeds to list those permissible actions in Article I
Section 8, while Section 9 lists actions that are prohibited for Congress. The
vesting clause in Article II places no limits on the Executive branch, simply
stating that, "The Executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United
States of America." The Supreme Court holds "The judicial Power" according to
Article III, and it established the implication of Judicial review in Marbury
vs Madison. The federal government refers to the branches as "branches of
government", while some systems use "government" to describe the executive. The
Executive branch has attempted to claim power arguing for separation of powers
to include being the Commander in Chief of a standing army since the American
Civil War, executive orders, emergency powers and security classifications
since World War II, national security, signing statements, and the scope of the
unitary executive. Checks and balances. To prevent one branch from becoming
supreme, protect the "opulent minority" from the majority, and to induce the
branches to cooperate, government systems that employ a separation of powers
need a way to balance each of the branches. Typically this was accomplished
through a system of "checks and balances", the origin of which, like separation
of powers itself, is specifically credited to Montesquieu. Checks and balances
allow for a system based regulation that allows one branch to limit another,
such as the power of Congress to alter the composition and jurisdiction of the
federal courts. Other systems. Costa Rica. In the aftermath of the 44-day civil
war in 1948 (after former President and incumbent candidate Rafael √Ålgel
Calder√≥n Guardia tried to take power through fraud, by not recognising the
results of the presidential election that he had lost), the question of which
transformational model the Costa Rican State would follow was the main issue
that confronted the victors. A Constituent Assembly was elected by popular vote
to draw up a new constitution, enacted in 1949, and remains in force. This
document was an edit of the constitution of 1871, as the constituent assembly
rejected more radical corporatist ideas proposed by the ruling Junta Fundadora
de la Segunda Rep√∫blica (which, although having come to power by military
force, abolished the armed forces). Nonetheless, the new constitution increased
centralization of power at the expense of municipalities and eliminated
provincial government altogether, at the time it increased the powers of
congress and the judiciary. It established the three supreme powers as the
legislature, executive, and judicial branches, but also created two other
autonomous state organs that have equivalent power, but not equivalent rank.
The first is the Supreme Elections Tribunal (electoral branch) which controls
elections and makes unique, unappealable decisions on their outcomes. The
second is the office of the Comptroller General (audit branch), an autonomous
and independent organ nominally subordinate to the unicameral legislative
assembly. All budgets of ministries and municipalities must pass through this
agency, including the execution of budget items such as contracting for routine
operations. The Comptroller also provides financial vigilance over government
offices and office holders, and routinely brings actions to remove mayors for
malfeasance, firmly establishing this organization as the fifth branch of the
Republic European Union. First, note that the European Union is a supranational
polity, and is neither a country nor a federation; but as the EU wields
political power and is fully aware of its "democratic deficit", it attempts to
comply with the principle of separation of powers. There are seven institutions
of the European Union. In intergovernmental matters, most power is concentrated
in the Council of the European Union ‚Äì giving it the characteristics of a
normal international organization. Here, all power at the EU level is in one
branch. In the latter there are four main actors. The European Commission acts
as an independent executive which is appointed by the Council in conjunction
with the European Parliament; but the Commission also has a legislative role as
the sole initiator of EU legislation. An early maxim was: "The Commission
proposes and the Council disposes"; and although the EU's lawmaking procedure
is now much more complicated, this simple maxim still holds some truth. As well
as both executive and legislative functions, the Commission arguably exercises
a third, quasi-judicial, function under Articles 101 & 102 TFEU (competition
law ); although the ECJ remains the final arbiter. The European Parliament is
one half of the legislative branch and is directly elected. The Council itself
acts both as the second half of the legislative branch and also holds some
executive functions (some of which are exercised by the related European
Council in practice). The European Court of Justice acts as the independent
judicial branch, interpreting EU law and treaties. The remaining institution,
the European Court of Auditors, is an independent audit authority (due to the
sensitive nature of fraud in the EU). Germany. Besides the constitutional court
the judicial branch at the federal level is made up of five supreme courts¬ ‚Äî
one for civil and criminal cases ("Bundesgerichtshof"), and one each for
administrative, tax, labour, and social security issues. There are also state
("L√§nder / Bundesl√§nder") based courts beneath them, and a rarely used senate
of the supreme courts. Hungary. The independent pillar status of the Hungarian
public accuser's office is a unique construction, loosely modeled on the system
Portugal introduced after the 1974 victory of the Carnation Revolution. The
public accuser (attorney general) body has became the fourth column of
Hungarian democracy only in recent times: after communism fell in 1989, the
office was made independent by a new clausule XI. of the Constitution. The
change was meant to prevent abuse of state power, especially with regards to
the use of false accusations against opposition politicians, who may be
excluded from elections if locked in protracted or excessively severe court
cases. To prevent the Hungarian accuser's office from neglecting its duties,
natural human private persons can submit investigation requests, called
"p√≥tmag√°nv√°d" directly to the courts, if the accusers' office refuses to do
its job. Courts will decide if the allegations have merit and order police to
act in lieu of the accuser's office if warranted. In its decision No.42/2005
the Hungarian constitutional court declared that the government does not enjoy
such privilege and the state is powerless to further pursue cases if the public
accuser refuses to do so. Republic of China (Taiwan). The president and vice
president as well as the defunct National Assembly are constitutionally not
part of the above five branches. Before being abolished in 2005, the National
Assembly was a constitutional convention and electoral college for the
president and vice president. Its constitutional amending powers were passed to
the legislative yuan and its electoral powers were passed to the electorate.
The relationship between the executive and legislative branches are poorly
defined. An example of the problems this causes is the near complete political
paralysis that results when the president, who has neither the power to veto
nor the ability to dissolve the legislature and call new elections, cannot
negotiate with the legislature when his party is in the minority. The
examination and control yuans are marginal branches; their leaders as well as
the leaders of the executive and judicial yuans are appointed by the president
and confirmed by the legislative yuan. The legislature is the only branch that
chooses its own leadership. The vice president has practically no
responsibilities.
