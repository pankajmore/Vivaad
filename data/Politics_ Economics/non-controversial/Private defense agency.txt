Private defense agency A private defense agency (PDA) is a conceptualized
agency that provides personal protection and military defense services
voluntarily through the free market. A PDA is not a private contractor of the
state and is not subsidised in any way through taxation or immunities, nor does
it rely on conscription and other involuntary methods. Instead, such agencies
would be financed primarily through insurance companies, which are penalized
for losses and damages, and have an incentive through competition to minimize
waste and maximize quality of service. PDAs are advocated in anarcho-capitalism
and market-based forms of social anarchism, such as Mutualism. Theory. As
proponents of free-market anarchism, Benjamin Tucker and Gustave de Molinari
first explicitly proposed for-profit private defense agencies. The concept
later was advanced and expanded upon by anarcho-capitalists who consider the
state to be illegitimate, and therefore believe defense is something that
should be provided or determined privately by individuals and firms competing
in a free market. The Mises Institute published a book of essays entitled '.
This concept is similar to Polycentric law. Within economics, discussion of the
concept largely has been confined to the Austrian School, as in Hans Hoppe's
article "The Private Production of Defense" published by the Mises Institute.
These authors emphasize that PDAs have different motives from existing statist
defense agencies. Their survival depends on quality of service leading to a
wide customer base, rather than the ability to extract funds via the force of
law, as is true of states. Customers and markets would thus dictate that PDAs
minimize offensive tendencies and militarization in favor of a pure defense.
Anarcho-capitalists believe such privatization and decentralization of defense
would eliminate the credibility of, and popular support for, the state. As a
private firm offering individually determined defense, the PDA provides a model
for how an entirely private defense would work in a free market. John Frederic
Kosanke argues that the need for large-scale defense is minimized in direct
inverse proportion to the extent of domestic control by the state. Since the
greater number of proprietors makes surrender more costly to an aggressor than
a relatively authoritarian region, vulnerability to attack is less likely.
Furthermore, since individuals minding their own business pose little threat to
neighboring regions, official or ideological justification by those neighbors
for attacking them is also proportionately diminished. Lack of monopoly power.
Tyler Cowen, however, argues that allowing private defense agencies would not
necessarily prevent a monopoly on defense services, by positing that a
cooperating network of such firms could use aggressive force to enforce the
cartel's market domination. Noting that advocates of PDAs typically argue that
abuses would be prevented by the presence of rival agencies acting under the
authority of rulings made by arbitrators empowered by inter-agency arbitration
agreements, Cowen opines, "The adjudication network is stable only if it can
use force to put down outlaw agencies that do not accept its higher-order
arbitration decisions. Such a network could also use force to put down firms
that do not adhere to the collusive agreement." Anarcho-capitalists argue that
competing defense providers would concentrate on comparatively lower-cost
defense and security technology rather than relatively costly offensive
weaponry, in order to maintain lower premiums and service charges. A company's
offensive capabilities would also be readily exposed by such an aggressor's
competitors. State-subsidized militaries, in contrast, are granted a distinct
offensive advantage, resulting in a proportionately greater tendency toward
monopolization. Treatment of soldiers. There is historical evidence that
military personnel would likely be paid more under a privatized system. In the
early nineteenth century, the typical monthly wage for a merchant seaman was
about $30. In a detailed survey of nine different American privateers and their
prize distributions, Garitee found the average value of one share to be about
$150. Since most crewmen earned from two to four shares, this meant that in the
typical privateer cruise of three months, a man might earn the equivalent of 18
months' wages, and sometimes more. Aggression and abuses by private defense
agencies. Randall G. Holcombe argues that "Firms might prey on their
competitors' customers, as competing mafia groups do, to show those customers
that their current protective firm is not doing the job and thus to induce them
to switch protection firms. This action seems to be a profit-maximizing
strategy; hence, protection firms that do not prey on noncustomers may not
survive." Holcombe states that the mafia offers protection for a fee, but it
also uses its resources for predation; and thus profit-maximizing firms could
be expected to employ them in the dual roles of protection and predation. Peter
Leeson and Edward Stringham rebut this argument by claiming that unless the
firm were overwhelmingly more powerful than its prey, it could incur
substantial costs and risks in attempting to extract wealth by force. They
argue that the potential for even a small state to inflict losses on an
aggressor explains why violent confrontations between states are less common
than between individuals in New York City's Central Park. In "The Market for
Liberty", Linda and Morris Tannehill note that a private defense agency would
be unlikely to engage in aggression, as it would not only become a target of
retaliatory force, but would become the subject of severe business ostracism.
Honest and productive individuals would dissociate themselves from it, fearing
that it might use its aggressive force against them in the event of a dispute;
or that they might become accidental casualties when retaliatory force is used
by one of its other victims; or that their own reputation would suffer due to
their ties to it. Moreover, the private defense agency's reputation would
suffer and it would be regarded as a poor credit and insurance risk, the latter
due to the high risk of claims resulting from its involvement in aggression.
The employees and leaders of such an agency as well could face personal civil
liability for their involvement, and the agency would not be shielded by
sovereign immunity. High-quality employees would presumably be less willing to
be involved with such an organization. They also argue that a defense company
would be less likely to abuse its power and impose tyranny, noting that it
"couldn't extract taxes from them, as a government does...A market relationship
is a free relationship, and if a customer doesn't like a company's service or
mistrusts its goals, he is free to take his business elsewhere, or to start his
own competitive company, or to do without the service and just provide from
himself...The objection that a tyrant might take over is actually a devastating
argument against government." Rothbard makes a similar point, noting, "Of
course, some of the private defense agencies will become criminal, just as some
people become criminal now. But the point is that in a stateless society there
would be no regular, "legalized" channel for crime and aggression, no
government apparatus the control of which provides a secure monopoly for
invasion of person and property...To create such an instrument "de novo" is
very difficult, and, indeed, almost impossible; historically, it took State
rulers centuries to create a functioning State apparatus." It has been argued,
"If Defense Agency A instead of invading a business decides to invade a more
worthwhile target such as a gold warehouse they are left with a much more
complicated problem. The gold warehouse is owned by an entrepreneur who has his
own defense agency and the gold in the warehouse also have owners that have
hired their own respective defense agencies. In essence, Defense Agency A will
have to deal with the wrath of the warehouse owner, the warehouse owner's
defense agency and the defense agencies of all the owners of the gold in that
warehouse." Robert P. Murphy opines that given the privatization of other
services in an anarcho-capitalist society, "We must consider that in such an
environment, the law-abiding majority would have all sorts of mechanisms at
their disposal, beyond physical confrontation. Once private judges had ruled
against a particular rogue agency, the private banks could freeze its assets
(up to the amount of fines levied by the arbitrators). In addition, the private
utility companies could shut down electricity and water to the agencyâ€™s
headquarters, in accordance with standard provisions in their contracts." The
argument that customers will be able to hire a competing firm to protect them
against a rogue defense agency has been critiqued by Jonathan Bond's essay,
"The Price of Private Law", which argues, "If two defense firms are engaged in
a truly â€˜localâ€™ dispute, and the remaining firms are not convinced that
either their own interests will be affected or that systemic destabilization
will result if the conflict continues, then the costs of intervening and ending
the inter-agency war could presumably bar such third parties from stepping into
the crossfire." Bond also argues that some firms may not be concerned with the
risk of alienating other clients, because their clientele may consist of a
small number of, or even only one, enormous multinational corporations. Bond
further argues that some PDAs may reduce their risk of retaliation by carrying
out anonymous sabotage or terrorist attacks. Villacampa notes that consumers
with large amounts of wealth would likely pay more for private defense, stating
"There is no reason for someone void of valuable assets to hire a defense
agency that is meant to protect assets other than oneself; but, in an
involuntary government payment is demanded for the services regardless of
whether they are use or not." He argues an alliance of aggressor private
defense agencies would likely be unprofitable: "Chances are high that a
mobilization of a mass army of defense agencies will cost more to each
individual than his gain from gold, land, and such divided equally amongst
themselves. If the region being attacked has large stashes of valuable goods,
they will most likely have very effective defense agencies (stronger defense
agencies for more valuable assets are logical) and thus the fight against the
invading defense agencies will inflict more cost upon the invaders." Financing
of private defense agencies. Defense is often viewed as an archetypical public
goodi.e., a product that can only be provided by government because of its non-
excludability and non-rivalrous consumption. Specifically, the free rider
problem, in which people refuse to pay for defense but instead rely on their
neighbors to pay for defending the community, is said to make it inevitable
that it be financed by taxes if an equitable allocation of costs is to be
achieved. According to anarcho-capitalist theorists, there are many ways by
which this problem can be overcome or rendered irrelevant. Rothbard's solution
was to simply say "Who cares?" when it comes to the issue of free riders. He
points out that free riders are commonplace in other aspects of our economy,
asking hypothetically, "Are we to be critical because more than one person
benefits from someone's actions?...In short, am I to be taxed for enjoying the
view of my neighbor's well-kept garden?" He notes that we are all free riders
on the past, as we would be living in a primitive society if it were not for
the efforts of our ancestors; and we are free riders on the present, because we
benefit from the continuing investment of our fellow men and from their
specialized skills on the market. Joseph R. Stromberg notes that the American
Revolution occurred despite the fact that some individuals might have been free
riders who benefited from it without funding it; he opines that successful
defense of freedom often relies not on precise allocations of cost, but on
"nationalism, religion, the desire for freedom, hatred of the enemy, social
pressure to do the right thing, and so on," some of which might represent
"enlightened self interest." Linda and Morris Tannehill believe that big
businesses will tend to pay the bulk of the defense costs (since they stand to
lose the most in the event of an attack); they would then pass on the costs to
their customers, and so the costs of defense would be spread out among the
whole population. A landowner seeking to establish a community may sell or
lease the land with provisions written into the deed or lease agreement,
requiring the new owner or tenant to pay for defense on a permanent basis; this
same technique has already been in some neighborhoods to ensure that residents
pay for private streets shared in common by all of them. As is true for
homeowners today, everyone would be responsible for buying or otherwise being
covered by aggression insurance in order to protect themselves against
catastrophic loss from foreign attack; in the event of an invasion, a claim
would be filed with right of subrogation, and the insurer would hire a private
defense company to collect from the aggressor. An argument against this method
of funding is that other aggression insurers who didn't pay for defense would
still benefit from the reduced risk of attack on their customers in the same
area, in effect becoming free riders who could drive the "altruistic" insurer
out of business. However, the private defense agency's activity need not be
limited to defensive and retaliatory measures funded by the insurer; It could
also go after the aggressor in an effort to obtain restitution (including
reasonable collection costs), perhaps through ransom or capture of enemy
assets, as privateers did in the 18th and 19th centuries under letters of
marque and reprisal. Prisoners of war also used to have shadow prices (ransoms)
which were a source of income for victorious forces; this represents another
potential alternative to taxation. Sometimes arguments are made for voluntary
funding of defense by way of attacking taxation. Anarcho-capitalists often
argue, for instance, that the argument that taxation is needed to fund
protection of liberty and property from aggression is a contradiction, because
taxation itself requires aggression in order to be enforced. Another argument
comes from the fact that, unlike voluntary transactions, no demonstrated
preference has been made by the taxpayer; so there is no objective way of
showing that he is receiving a service he wants and needs, at a price that is
fair. Historical examples of widespread use. Ancient Europe. Ancient city-
states in Greece and Rome depended on liturgiescontributions made by rich
citizens for specific purposesfor defense. A liturgy might be used, for
instance, to fund the manning of a warship. Although a certain amount was
assessed by magistrates, some citizens paid more than required in order to
obtain popularity, influence, and sympathy among jurors in the event they were
taken to court. During the Second Punic War, Quintus Maximus Fabius Cunctator
used his personal resources to pay for the release of some Roman prisoners.
When the son of Scipio Africanus, who at the time was acting as de facto
commander-in chief, was captured during the war against Antiochus III the Great
in 190 BC, he came up with ransom himself. As Rome grew wealthier, greater use
was made of private money and/or private armed forces, consisting of relatives
and clients, to accomplish public objectives. Between 73 and 71 BC, Marcus
Licinius Crassus and Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus used their own resources to
suppress the armies of Spartacus in the Third Servile War. Julius Caesar made
his fortune by vanquishing pirates in the Mediterranean and then by conquering
Gaul. The emergence of the modern state caused the members of the upper classes
to be disarmed. Medieval Iceland. According to David Friedman, "Medieval
Icelandic institutions have several peculiar and interesting characteristics;
they might almost have been invented by a mad economist to test the lengths to
which market systems could supplant government in its most fundamental
functions." While not directly labeling it anarcho-capitalist, he argues that
the Icelandic Commonwealth between 930 and 1262 had "some features" of an
anarcho-capitalist societyÂ â€“ while there was a single legal system,
enforcement of law was entirely private and highly capitalist; and so provides
some evidence of how such a society would function. "Even where the Icelandic
legal system recognized an essentially "public" offense, it dealt with it by
giving some individual (in some cases chosen by lot from those affected) the
right to pursue the case and collect the resulting fine, thus fitting it into
an essentially private system." American Old West. According to Anderson,
"Defining anarcho-capitalist to mean minimal government with property rights
developed from the bottom up, the western frontier was anarcho-capitalistic.
People on the frontier invented institutions that fit the resource constraints
they faced." Early Pennsylvania. Murray Rothbard's history of Colonial America
"Conceived in Liberty" discussed a period where Pennsylvania fell into a state
of anarchism and how William Penn struggled for about a decade to reinstate his
government over a people who did not want it.
