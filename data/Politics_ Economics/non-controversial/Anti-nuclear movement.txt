Anti-nuclear movement [[Image:ANTIAKW.jpg|thumb|right|120,000 people attended
an anti-nuclear protest in Bonn, Germany, on October 14, 1979, following the
Three Mile Island accident. The anti-nuclear movement is a social movement that
opposes various nuclear technologies. Many direct action groups, environmental
groups, and professional organisations have identified themselves with the
movement at the local, national, and international level. Major anti-nuclear
groups include Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Friends of the Earth,
Greenpeace, International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, and the
Nuclear Information and Resource Service. The initial objective of the movement
was nuclear disarmament, though the focus has shifted to include opposition to
the use of nuclear power. There have been many large anti-nuclear
demonstrations and protests. A protest against nuclear power occurred in July
1977 in Bilbao, Spain, with up to 200,000 people in attendance. Following the
Three Mile Island accident in 1979, an anti-nuclear protest was held in New
York City, involving 200,000 people. In 1981, Germany's largest anti-nuclear
power demonstration took place to protest against the Brokdorf Nuclear Power
Plant west of Hamburg; some 100,000 people came face to face with 10,000 police
officers. The largest anti-nuclear protest was held on June 12, 1982, when one
million people demonstrated in New York City against nuclear weapons. A 1983
nuclear weapons protest in West Berlin had about 600,000 participants. In May
1986, following the Chernobyl disaster, an estimated 150,000 to 200,000 people
marched in Rome to protest against the Italian nuclear program. For many years
after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster nuclear power was off the policy agenda in
most countries, and the anti-nuclear power movement seemed to have won its
case. Some anti-nuclear groups disbanded. In the 2000s (decade), however,
following public relations activities by the nuclear industry, advances in
nuclear reactor designs, and concerns about climate change, nuclear power
issues came back into energy policy discussions in some countries. The 2011
Japanese nuclear accidents subsequently undermined the nuclear power industry's
proposed renaissance and revived anti-nuclear passions worldwide, putting
governments on the defensive. As of 2011, countries such as Australia, Austria,
Denmark, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lichtenstein, Luxembourg, Malta,
Portugal, Israel, Malaysia, New Zealand, and Norway remain opposed to nuclear
power. Germany and Switzerland are phasing-out nuclear power. History and
issues. Roots of the movement. The application of nuclear technology, as a
source of energy, radiopharmaceuticals and as an instrument of war, has been
controversial. Scientists and diplomats have debated nuclear weapons policy
since before the Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. The public
became concerned about nuclear weapons testing from about 1954, following
extensive nuclear testing in the Pacific. In 1961, at the height of the Cold
War, about 50,000 women brought together by Women Strike for Peace marched in
60 cities in the United States to demonstrate against nuclear weapons. In 1963,
many countries ratified the Partial Test Ban Treaty which prohibited
atmospheric nuclear testing. Some local opposition to nuclear power emerged in
the early 1960s, and in the late 1960s some members of the scientific community
began to express their concerns. In the early 1970s, there were large protests
about a proposed nuclear power plant in Wyhl, Germany. The project was
cancelled in 1975 and anti-nuclear success at Wyhl inspired opposition to
nuclear power in other parts of Europe and North America. Nuclear power became
an issue of major public protest in the 1970s. Anti-nuclear concerns. Concerns
about nuclear weapons. There is the existential threat of nuclear war by
accidental or deliberate nuclear strike, and many local communities are
affected by nuclear weapons testing, uranium mining, and radioactive waste
disposal. Ridding the world of nuclear weapons has been a cause of the pacifist
left for decades. But more recently mainstream politicians and retired military
leaders have advocated disarmament. In January 2007 a seminal article appeared
in the "Wall Street Journal", authored by Henry Kissinger, Bill Perry, George
Shultz and Sam Nunn. These men were veterans of the cold-war who believed in
using nuclear weapons for deterrence. But they now reversed their previous
position and asserted that instead of making the world safer, nuclear weapons
had become a source of extreme concern: The risk of accidents, misjudgments or
unauthorised launches, they argued, was growing more acute in a world of
rivalries between relatively new nuclear states that lacked the security
safeguards developed over many years by America and the Soviet Union. The
emergence of pariah states, such as North Korea (possibly soon to be joined by
Iran), armed with nuclear weapons was adding to the fear as was the declared
ambition of terrorists to steal, buy or build a nuclear device. Only by a
concerted effort to free the world of nuclear weapons could the terrifying
trend be reversed. In contrast political scientist Kenneth Waltz argues that
Nuclear weapons explain the relative peace the world has experienced since
World War II, and the downturn in the historically high number of war deaths
that were prevalent prior to their invention. He argues they prevented the Cold
War turning hot, via deterrence theory and by being such destructive weapons
have brought a relative peace and stability worldwide through the
Stability‚Äìinstability paradox. Kenneth Waltz in the July 2012 issue of
Foreign Affairs has also stated that Most U.S., European, and Israeli
commentators and policymakers warn that a nuclear-armed Iran would be the worst
possible outcome of the current standoff. In fact, it would probably be the
best possible result: the one most likely to restore stability to the Middle
East, as Israel's monopoly on Nuclear Weapons begs to be balanced. Some climate
scientists estimate that a war between two countries that resulted in 100
Hiroshima-size atomic explosions would cause significant loss of life, in the
tens of millions from climatic effects alone. As there might also be much soot
thrown up into the atmosphere which could blanket the earth, causing food chain
disruption in what is termed a Nuclear Winter. However this hypothesis is
highly controversial as nuclear winter results have been used as a politically
motivated tool to promote particular stands on nuclear policy-making, and the
underlying assumptions in the Nuclear Winter climatology papers to date are in
disrepute. During the era of nuclear weapons testing many local communities
were affected, and some are still affected by uranium mining, and radioactive
waste disposal. Concerns about nuclear power. Of these concerns, nuclear
accidents and disposal of long-lived radioactive waste have probably had the
greatest public impact worldwide. Anti-nuclear campaigners point to the 2011
Fukushima nuclear emergency as proof that nuclear power can never be 100% safe.
In his book "Global Fission: The Battle Over Nuclear Power", Jim Falk explores
connections between technological concerns and political concerns. Falk
suggests that concerns of citizen groups or individuals who oppose nuclear
power have often focused initially on the "range of physical hazards which
accompany the technology". Concern often starts with a single issue, such as
radioactive waste, but over time concerns usually spread and the focus
broadens. Falk suggests that with a richer and more sophisticated understanding
of issues comes more concerns and eventually, almost inevitably says Falk, this
leads to a "concern over the political relations of the nuclear industry". John
Vidal has said "The point is that right across the world it is not just the
nuclear technology which is so offensive to people, but the arrogance,
callousness and ruthless steamrollering of any opposition that invariably
accompanies nuclear projects. What the pro-nuclear folk here do not seem to
understand is that the abuse of political power is as dangerous as the power
source itself". People must have come not only to distrust the safety of the
technology but also the authority of those who have assured them so confidently
that nuclear power is safe. In this sense people distrust the entire nuclear
enterprise -- not only its technology, but the public and private
organizations, the political parties, and those often prestigious scientists
who advocate and assist in the development of nuclear power. In 2010, Baruch
Fischhoff, a social science professor said that many people really do not trust
the nuclear industry. He stated that "although it hasn‚Äôt done anything
recently to lose the general public‚Äôs trust, it hasn‚Äôt done anything to
gain people‚Äôs trust". M.V. Ramana says that "distrust of the social
institutions that manage nuclear energy is widespread", and a 2001 survey by
the European Commission found that "only 10.1 percent of Europeans trusted the
nuclear industry". This public distrust is periodically reinforced by nuclear
safety violations, or through ineffectiveness or corruption of the nuclear
regulatory authorities. Once lost, says Ramana, trust is extremely difficult to
regain. Faced with public antipathy, the nuclear industry has "tried a variety
of strategies to persuade the public to accept nuclear power", including the
publication of numerous "fact sheets" that discuss issues of public concern.
M.V. Ramana says that none of these strategies have been very successful. There
is a split amongst many anti-Nuclear advocates, with some within the movement
being completely against all Nuclear technology and others opposed only to
Nuclear weapons. One organization within the movement which completely supports
nuclear reactors but advocates for the elimination of Nuclear weapons is the
Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. Amongst the pro-Nuclear reactor section of
the movement, one factor influencing their support of reactors is due to the
appeal that reactors have at reducing Nuclear weapons arsenals through the
Megatons to Megawatts Program, a program which has thus far eliminated 425
metric tons of highly enriched uranium, the equivalent of 17,000 nuclear
warheads, by converting it into fuel for commercial nuclear reactors, and is
the single most successful non-proliferation program to date. Anti-Nuclear
weapon advocates, such as the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists want to see the
Megatons to Megawatts Program not only continue but be expanded, whereas others
within the anti-Nuclear movement are more concerned with immediately shutting
down all the Nuclear reactors in the world. The program appeals to anti-Nuclear
weapon advocates as it provides a financial incentive for countries with vast
quantities of Nuclear weapons, like Russia, to dismantle their arsenal and sell
the fissile fuel contained within to operators of Nuclear reactors. The
Megatons to Megawatts Program has been hailed as a major success by anti-
nuclear weapon advocates as it has largely been the driving force behind the
sharp reduction in the quantity of Nuclear Weapons worldwide since the cold war
ended. However without an increase in Nuclear reactors and greater demand for
fissile fuel, the cost of dismantling and downblending has dissuaded Russia
from continuing their disarmament. Currently, according to Harvard professor
Matthew Bunn: The Russians are not remotely interested in extending the program
beyond 2013. We've managed to set it up in a way that costs them more and
profits them less than them just making new low-enriched uranium for reactors
from scratch. But there are other ways to set it up that would be very
profitable for them and would also serve some of their strategic interests in
boosting their nuclear exports. Nuclear reactor proponents have also tried to
regain public support by offering newer, safer, reactor designs. These designs
include those that incorporate passive safety and Small Modular Reactors. While
these reactor designs "are intended to inspire trust, they may have an
unintended effect: creating distrust of older reactors that lack the touted
safety features". Since 2000 the nuclear industry has undertaken an
international media and lobbying campaign to promote nuclear power as a
solution to the greenhouse effect and climate change. Nuclear power, the
industry says, emits no or negligible amounts of carbon dioxide. Anti-nuclear
groups respond by saying that only reactor operation is free of carbon dioxide
emissions. All other stages of the nuclear fuel chain ‚Äì mining, milling,
transport, fuel fabrication, enrichment, reactor construction, decommissioning
and waste management ‚Äì use fossil fuels and hence emit carbon dioxide.
However there is currently no energy source, including Renewable sources that
do not produce at least some CO2 during their manufacture or use. In 2011, a
French court fined √âlectricit√© de France (EDF) ‚Ç¨1.5m and jailed two senior
employees for spying on Greenpeace, including hacking into Greenpeace's
computer systems. Greenpeace was awarded ‚Ç¨500,000 in damages. Other
technologies. A major nuclear fusion research and development program is
underway called the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor. It
involves the European Union, Japan, China, India, South Korea, Russia, and the
USA. According to most anti-nuclear groups, nuclear fusion power ‚Äúremains a
distant dream‚Äù. The World Nuclear Association says that fusion "presents so
far insurmountable scientific and engineering challenges". Anti-nuclear groups
advocate reduced reliance on Nuclear reactor-produced medical radioisotopes,
used in essential diagnostic procedures and radiopharmaceuticals, through the
use of alternative radioisotope production and alternative clinical
technologies which have, as of yet, to be proven feasible. As of 2012
Cyclotrons have been demonstrated to hold the promise of potentially displacing
Nuclear reactors as the source of Technetium-99m but as of yet the technology
is only in the demonstration phase and no Medical exams have been conducted
with the Cyclotron produced isotope. Although the anti-nuclear movement desire
for an increase in high power Cyclotrons at hospitals that perhaps may someday
be capable of completely replacing Nuclear reactor produced
radiopharmaceuticals. Cyclotrons also pose a proliferation risk as they are
also capable of being used to enrich uranium, and large cyclotrons known as
Calutrons were used in the Manhattan Project to produce enriched Uranium and
similarly were used in Saddam Hussein's Nuclear program. Making the plan to
replace Nuclear reactor sourced medical isotopes with cylcotrons of
questionable benefit. Nuclear-free alternatives. Anti-nuclear groups say that
reliance on nuclear energy can be reduced by adopting energy conservation and
energy efficiency measures. Energy efficiency can reduce energy consumption
while providing the same level of energy "services". Lester R. Brown. "Plan B
4.0: Mobilizing to Save Civilization", Earth Policy Institute, 2009, p. 135.
Wind power is growing at over 20% annually, with a worldwide installed capacity
of 238,000 megawatts (MW) at the end of 2011, and is widely used in Europe,
Asia, and the United States. At the end of 2011 the photovoltaic (PV) capacity
worldwide was 67,000 MW, and PV power stations are popular in Germany and
Italy. Solar thermal power stations operate in the USA and Spain, and the
largest of these is the 354 MW SEGS power plant in the Mojave Desert. The
world's largest geothermal power installation is the Geysers in California,
with a rated capacity of 750 MW. Brazil has one of the largest renewable energy
programs in the world, involving production of ethanol fuel from sugarcane, and
ethanol now provides 18% of the country's automotive fuel. Ethanol fuel is also
widely available in the USA. Greenpeace advocates reduction of fossil fuels by
50% by 2050 as well as phasing out nuclear power, contending that innovative
technologies can increase energy efficiency, and suggests that by 2050 most
electricity will come from renewable sources. The International Energy Agency
estimates that nearly 50% of global electricity supplies will need to come from
renewable energy sources in order to halve carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 and
minimise climate change impacts. Activities. Large protests. In 1971, the town
of Wyhl, in Germany, was a proposed site for a nuclear power station. In the
years that followed, public opposition steadily mounted, and there were large
protests. Television coverage of police dragging away farmers and their wives
helped to turn nuclear power into a major issue. In 1975, an administrative
court withdrew the construction licence for the plant. The Wyhl experience
encouraged the formation of citizen action groups near other planned nuclear
sites. In 1972, the nuclear disarmament movement maintained a presence in the
Pacific, largely in response to French nuclear testing there. Activists sailed
boats into the test zone, and interrupting the testing program. In Australia,
thousands of people joined protest marches in Adelaide, Melbourne, Brisbane,
and Sydney. Scientists issued statements demanding an end to the nuclear tests.
In Fiji, anti-nuclear activists formed an Against Testing on Mururoa
organization. In the Basque Country (Spain and France), a strong anti-nuclear
movement emerged in 1973, which ultimately led to the abandonment of most of
the planned nuclear power projects. On July 14, 1977, in Bilbao, between
150,000 and 200,000 people protested against the Lemoniz Nuclear Power Plant.
This has been called the "biggest ever anti-nuclear demonstration". In France,
there were mass protests in the early 1970s, organized at nearly every planned
nuclear site in France. Between 1975 and 1977, some 175,000 people protested
against nuclear power in ten demonstrations. In 1977 there was a massive
demonstration at the Superph√©nix breeder reactor in Creys-Malvillein which
culminated in violence. In West Germany, between February 1975 and April 1979,
some 280,000 people were involved in seven demonstrations at nuclear sites.
Several site occupations were also attempted. Following the Three Mile Island
accident in 1979, some 120,000 people attended a demonstration against nuclear
power in Bonn. In the Philippines, there were many protests in the late 1970s
and 1980s against the proposed Bataan Nuclear Power Plant, which was built but
never operated. In 1981, Germany's largest anti-nuclear power demonstration
protested against the construction of the Brokdorf Nuclear Power Plant west of
Hamburg. Some 100,000 people came face to face with 10,000 police officers. In
the late 1970s and early 1980s, the revival of the nuclear arms race, triggered
a new wave of protests about nuclear weapons. Older organizations such as the
Federation of Atomic Scientists revived, and newer organizations appeared,
including the Nuclear Weapons Freeze Campaign and Physicians for Social
Responsibility. In the UK, on 1 April 1983, about 70,000 people linked arms to
form a 14 mile long human chain between three nuclear weapons centres in
Berkshire. On Palm Sunday 1982, 100,000 Australians participated in anti-
nuclear rallies in the nation's largest cities. Growing year by year, the
rallies drew 350,000 participants in 1985. In May 1986, following the Chernobyl
disaster, clashes between anti-nuclear protesters and West German police were
common. More than 400 people were injured in mid-May at a nuclear-waste
reprocessing plant being built near Wackersdorf. Also in May 1986, an estimated
150,000 to 200,000 people marched in Rome to protest against the Italian
nuclear program, and 50,000 marched in Milan. Hundreds of people walked from
Los Angeles to Washington, D.C. in 1986 in what is referred to as the Great
Peace March for Global Nuclear Disarmament. The march took nine months to
traverse , advancing approximately fifteen miles per day. The anti-nuclear
organisation "Nevada Semipalatinsk" was formed in 1989 and was one of the first
major anti-nuclear groups in the former Soviet Union. It attracted thousands of
people to its protests and campaigns which eventually led to the closure of the
nuclear test site in north-east Kazakhstan, in 1991. Protests in the United
States. There were many anti-nuclear protests in the United States which
captured national public attention during the 1970s and 1980s. These included
the well-known Clamshell Alliance protests at Seabrook Station Nuclear Power
Plant and the Abalone Alliance protests at Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant,
where thousands of protesters were arrested. Other large protests followed the
1979 Three Mile Island accident. A large anti-nuclear demonstration was held in
May 1979 in Washington D.C., when 65,000 people including the Governor of
California, attended a march and rally against nuclear power. In New York City
on September 23, 1979, almost 200,000 people attended a protest against nuclear
power. Anti-nuclear power protests preceded the shutdown of the Shoreham,
Yankee Rowe, Millstone I, Rancho Seco, Maine Yankee, and about a dozen other
nuclear power plants. On June 3, 1981, Thomas launched the longest running
peace vigil in US history at Lafayette Square in Washington, D.C.. He was later
joined on the White House Peace Vigil by anti-nuclear activists Concepcion
Picciotto and Ellen Benjamin. On June 12, 1982, one million people demonstrated
in New York City's Central Park against nuclear weapons and for an end to the
cold war arms race. It was the largest anti-nuclear protest and the largest
political demonstration in American history. International Day of Nuclear
Disarmament protests were held on June 20, 1983 at 50 sites across the United
States. In 1986, hundreds of people walked from Los Angeles to Washington DC in
the Great Peace March for Global Nuclear Disarmament. There were many Nevada
Desert Experience protests and peace camps at the Nevada Test Site during the
1980s and 1990s. Recent developments. For many years after the 1986 Chernobyl
disaster nuclear power was off the policy agenda in most countries, and the
anti-nuclear power movement seemed to have won its case. Some anti-nuclear
groups disbanded. In the 2000s (decade), however, following public relations
activities by the nuclear industry, advances in nuclear reactor designs, and
concerns about climate change, nuclear power issues came back into energy
policy discussions in some countries. The 2011 Japanese nuclear accidents
subsequently undermined the nuclear power industry's proposed come back. 2004-
2006. In January 2004, up to 15,000 anti-nuclear protesters marched in Paris
against a new generation of nuclear reactors, the European Pressurised Water
Reactor (EPWR). On May 1, 2005, 40,000 anti-nuclear/anti-war protesters marched
past the United Nations in New York, 60 years after the atomic bombings of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This was the largest anti-nuclear rally in the U.S. for
several decades. In Britain, there were many protests about the government's
proposal to replace the aging Trident weapons system with a newer model. The
largest protest had 100,000 participants and, according to polls, 59 percent of
the public opposed the move. 2007-2009. On March 17, 2007 simultaneous
protests, organised by "Sortir du nucl√©aire", were staged in five French towns
to protest construction of EPR plants; Rennes, Lyon, Toulouse, Lille, and
Strasbourg. In June 2007, 4,000 local residents, students and anti-nuclear
activists took to the streets in the city of Kudus in Indonesia's Central Java,
calling on the Government to abandon plans to build a nuclear power plant
there. In February 2008, a group of concerned scientists and engineers called
for the closure of the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant in Japan. The
International Conference on Nuclear Disarmament took place in Oslo in February
2008, and was organized by The Government of Norway, the Nuclear Threat
Initiative and the Hoover Institute. The Conference was entitled "Achieving the
Vision of a World Free of Nuclear Weapons" and had the purpose of building
consensus between nuclear weapon states and non-nuclear weapon states in
relation to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty. During a weekend in October
2008, some 15,000 people disrupted the transport of radioactive nuclear waste
from France to a dump in Germany. This was one of the largest such protests in
many years and, according to "Der Spiegel", it signals a revival of the anti-
nuclear movement in Germany. In 2009, the coalition of green parties in the
European parliament, who are unanimous in their anti-nuclear position,
increased their presence in the parliament from 5.5% to 7.1% (52 seats). In
October 2008 in the United Kingdom, more than 30 people were arrested during
one of the largest anti-nuclear protests at the Atomic Weapons Establishment at
Aldermaston for 10 years. The demonstration marked the start of the UN World
Disarmament Week and involved about 400 people. In 2008 and 2009, there have
been protests about, and criticism of, several new nuclear reactor proposals in
the United States. There have also been some objections to license renewals for
existing nuclear plants. A convoy of 350 farm tractors and 50,000 protesters
took part in an anti-nuclear rally in Berlin on September 5, 2009. The marchers
demanded that Germany close all nuclear plants by 2020 and close the Gorleben
radioactive dump. Gorleben is the focus of the anti-nuclear movement in
Germany, which has tried to derail train transports of waste and to destroy or
block the approach roads to the site. Two above-ground storage units house
3,500 containers of radioactive sludge and thousands of tonnes of spent fuel
rods. 2010. On April 21, 2010, a dozen environmental organizations called on
the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission to investigate possible
limitations in the AP1000 reactor design. These groups appealed to three
federal agencies to suspend the licensing process because they believed
containment in the new design is weaker than existing reactors. On April 24,
2010, about 120,000 people built a human chain (KETTENreAKTION!) between the
nuclear plants at Kr√ºmmel and Brunsb√ºttel. In this way they were
demonstrating against the plans of the German government to extend the life of
nuclear power reactors. In May 2010, some 25,000 people, including members of
peace organizations and 1945 atomic bomb survivors, marched for about two
kilometers from downtown New York to the United Nations headquarters, calling
for the elimination of nuclear weapons. In September 2010, German government
policy shifted back toward nuclear energy, and this generated some new anti-
nuclear sentiment in Berlin and beyond. On September 18, 2010, tens of
thousands of Germans surrounded Chancellor Angela Merkel‚Äôs office in an anti-
nuclear demonstration that organisers said was the biggest of its kind since
the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. In October 2010, tens of thousands of people
protested in Munich against the nuclear power policy of Angela Merkel's
coalition government. The action was the largest anti-nuclear event in Bavaria
for more than two decades. In November 2010, there were violent protests
against a train carrying reprocessed nuclear waste in Germany. Tens of
thousands of protesters gathered in Dannenberg to signal their opposition to
the cargo. Around 16,000 police were mobilised to deal with the protests. In
December 2010, some 10,000 people (mainly fishermen, farmers and their
families) turned out to oppose the Jaitapur Nuclear Power Project in the
Maharashtra state of India, amid a heavy police presence. In December 2010,
five anti-nuclear weapons activists, including octogenarians and Jesuit
priests, were convicted of conspiracy and trespass in Tacoma, USA. They cut
fences at Naval Base Kitsap-Bangor in 2009 to protest submarine nuclear
weapons, and reached an area near where Trident nuclear warheads are stored in
bunkers. Members of the group could face up to 10 years in prison. 2011. In
January 2011, five Japanese young people held a hunger strike for more than a
week, outside the Prefectural Government offices in Yamaguchi City, to protest
against the planned Kaminoseki Nuclear Power Plant near the environmentally
sensitive Seto Inland Sea. Following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster,
anti-nuclear opposition intensified in Germany. On 12 March 2011, 60,000
Germans formed a 45-km human chain from Stuttgart to the Neckarwestheim power
plant. On 14 March, 110,000 people protested in 450 other German towns, with
opinion polls indicating 80% of Germans opposed the government's extension of
nuclear power. On March 15, 2011, Angela Merkel said that seven nuclear power
plants which went online before 1980 would be temporarily closed and the time
would be used to study speedier renewable energy commercialization. In March
2011, around 2,000 anti-nuclear protesters demonstrated in Taiwan for an
immediate halt to the construction of the island's fourth nuclear power plant.
The protesters were also opposed to plans to extend the lifespan of three
existing nuclear plants. In March 2011, more than 200,000 people took part in
anti-nuclear protests in four large German cities, on the eve of state
elections. Organisers called it the largest anti-nuclear demonstration the
country has seen. Thousands of Germans demanding an end to the use of nuclear
power took part in nationwide demonstrations on 2 April 2011. About 7,000
people took part in anti-nuclear protests in Bremen. About 3,000 people
protested outside RWE's headquarters in Essen. Citing the Fukushima nuclear
disaster, environmental activists at a U.N. meeting in April 2011 "urged bolder
steps to tap renewable energy so the world doesn't have to choose between the
dangers of nuclear power and the ravages of climate change". In mid-April,
17,000 people protested at two demonstrations in Tokyo against nuclear power.
In India, environmentalists, local farmers and fishermen have been protesting
for months over the planned Jaitapur Nuclear Power Project six-reactor complex,
420¬ km south of Mumbai. If built, it would be one of the world's largest
nuclear power complexes. Protests have escalated following Japan's Fukushima
nuclear disaster and during two days of violent rallies in April 2011, a local
man was killed and dozens were injured. In May 2011, some 20,000 people turned
out for Switzerland's largest anti-nuclear power demonstration in 25 years.
Demonstrators marched peacefully near the Beznau Nuclear Power Plant, the
oldest in Switzerland, which started operating 40 years ago. Days after the
anti-nuclear rally, Cabinet decided to ban the building of new nuclear power
reactors. The country‚Äôs five existing reactors would be allowed to continue
operating, but "would not be replaced at the end of their life span". In May
2011, 5,000 people joined a carnival-like anti-nuclear protest in Taipei City.
This was part of a nationwide ‚ÄúNo Nuke Action‚Äù protest, urging the
government to stop construction of a Fourth Nuclear Plant and pursue a more
sustainable energy policy. On World Environment Day in June 2011, environmental
groups demonstrated against Taiwan's nuclear power policy. The Taiwan
Environmental Protection Union, together with 13 environmental groups and
legislators, gathered in Taipei and protested against the nation‚Äôs three
operating nuclear power plants and the construction of a fourth plant. Three
months after the Fukushima nuclear disaster, thousands of anti-nuclear
protesters marched in Japan. Company workers, students, and parents with
children rallied across Japan, "venting their anger at the government's
handling of the crisis, carrying flags bearing the words 'No Nukes!' and 'No
More Fukushima'." In August 2011, about 2,500 people including farmers and
fishermen marched in Tokyo. They are suffering heavy losses following the
Fukushima nuclear disaster, and called for prompt compensation from plant
operator TEPCO and the government. In September 2011, anti-nuclear protesters,
marching to the beat of drums, ‚Äútook to the streets of Tokyo and other cities
to mark six months since the March earthquake and tsunami and vent their anger
at the government's handling of the nuclear crisis set off by meltdowns at the
Fukushima power plant‚Äù. Protesters called for a complete shutdown of Japanese
nuclear power plants and demanded a shift in government policy toward
alternative sources of energy. Among the protestors were four young men who
started a 10-day hunger strike to bring about change in Japan's nuclear policy.
Tens of thousands of people marched in central Tokyo in September 2011,
chanting "Sayonara nuclear power" and waving banners, to call on Japan's
government to abandon atomic energy in the wake of the Fukushima nuclear
disaster. Author Kenzaburo Oe and musician Ryuichi Sakamoto were among the
event's supporters. Since the March 2011 Japanese Fukushima nuclear disaster,
"populations around proposed Indian NPP sites have launched protests that are
now finding resonance around the country, raising questions about atomic energy
as a clean and safe alternative to fossil fuels". Assurances by Prime Minister
Manmohan Singh that all safety measures will be implemented, have not been
heeded, and there have thus been mass protests against the French-backed 9900
MW Jaitapur Nuclear Power Project in Maharashtra and the 2000 MW Koodankulam
Nuclear Power Plant in Tamil Nadu. The state government of West Bengal state
has also refused permission to a proposed 6000 MW facility where six Russian
reactors were to be built. A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) has also been
filed against the government‚Äôs civil nuclear program at the apex Supreme
Court. The PIL specifically asks for the "staying of all proposed nuclear power
plants till satisfactory safety measures and cost-benefit analyses are
completed by independent agencies". Michael Banach, the current Vatican
representative to the International Atomic Energy Agency, told a conference in
Vienna in September 2011 that ‚Äúthis year‚Äôs nuclear disaster in Japan has
raised new concerns about the safety of nuclear plants around the world‚Äù.
Auxiliary bishop of Osaka Michael Goro Matsuura said: ‚ÄúI believe that this
serious incident should be a lesson for Japan and for the entire planet and
will be an incentive to abandon these projects. We call on the solidarity of
Christians worldwide to support this campaign.‚Äù Statements from bishops‚Äô
conferences in Korea and the Philippines called on their governments to abandon
atomic power. Columban priest Fr Se√°n McDonagh's forthcoming book is entitled
"Is Fukushima the Death Knell for Nuclear Energy?". In the UK, in October 2011,
more than 200 protesters blockaded the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station
site. Members of the Stop New Nuclear alliance barred access to the site in
protest at EDF Energy's plans to build two new reactors on the site. 2012. In
January 2012, 22 South Korean women's' groups appealed for a nuclear free
future, saying they believe nuclear weapons and power reactors "threaten our
lives, the lives of our families and all living creatures". The women said they
feel an enormous sense of crisis after the Fukushima nuclear disaster in March
2011, which demonstrated the destructive power of radiation in the disruption
of human lives, environmental pollution, and food contamination. Thousands of
demonstrators took to the streets of Yokohama, Japan, on January 14‚Äì15, 2012,
to show their support for a nuclear power-free world. The demonstration showed
that organized opposition to nuclear power has gained momentum following the
Fukushima nuclear disaster. The most immediate demand of the demonstrators was
for the protection of rights, including basic human rights such as health care,
for those affected by the Fukushima accident. In January 2012, three hundred
anti-nuclear protestors marched against plans to build a new nuclear power
station at Wylfa in the UK. The march was organised by Pobl Atal Wylfa B,
Greenpeace and Cymdeithas yr Iaith, which are supporting a farmer who is in
dispute with Horizon. On the anniversary of the 11 March earthquake and
tsunami, protesters across Japan called for the abolishment of nuclear power
and nuclear reactors. In Koriyama, Fukushima, 16,000 people called for the end
of nuclear power. In Shizuoka Prefecture, 1,100 people appealed for the
scrapping of the Hamaoka Nuclear Power Plant. In Tsuruga, Fukui, 1,200 people
marched in the streets of the city of Tsuruga, the home of the Monju fast-
breeder reactor prototype and other nuclear reactors. In Nagasaki and Hirosima,
anti-nuclear protesters and atomic-bomb survivors marched together and demanded
that Japan should end its nuclear dependency. Austrian Chancellor Werner
Faymann expects anti-nuclear petition drives to start in at least six European
Union countries in 2012 in an effort to have the EU abandon nuclear power.
Under the EU's Lisbon Treaty, petitions that attract at least one million
signatures can seek legislative proposals from the European Commission, which
would pave the way for anti-nuclear activists to garner support. In March 2012,
about 2,000 people staged an anti-nuclear protest in Taiwan's capital following
the massive tsunami that hit Japan one year ago. The protesters rallied in
Taipei to renew calls for a nuclear-free island. They "want the government to
scrap a plan to operate a newly constructed nuclear power plant - the fourth in
densely populated Taiwan". Scores of aboriginal protesters "demanded the
removal of 100,000 barrels of nuclear waste stored on their Orchid Island". In
March 2012, hundreds of anti-nuclear demonstrators converged on the Australian
headquarters of global mining giants BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto. The 500-strong
march through southern Melbourne called for an end to uranium mining in
Australia, and included speeches and performances by representatives of the
expatriate Japanese community as well as Australia's Indigenous communities,
who are concerned about the effects of uranium mining near tribal lands. There
were also events in Sydney. In March 2012, South Korean environmental groups
held a rally in Seoul to oppose nuclear power. Over 5,000 people attended, and
the turnout was one of the largest in recent memory for an anti-nuclear rally.
The demonstration demanded that President Lee Myung Bak abandon his policy of
promoting nuclear power. In March 2012, police said they had arrested nearly
200 anti-nuclear activists who were protesting the restart of work at the long-
stalled Indian Kudankulam nuclear power plant. In June 2012, tens of thousands
of Japanese protesters participated in anti-nuclear power rallies in Tokyo and
Osaka, over the government's decision to restart the first idled reactors since
the Fukushima disaster, at Oi Nuclear Power Plant in Fukui Prefecture. Impact.
Impact on popular culture. Beginning in the 1960s, anti-nuclear ideas received
coverage in the popular media with novels such as "Fail-Safe" and feature films
such as "" (1964), "The China Syndrome" (1979), "Silkwood" (1983), and "The
Rainbow Warrior" (1992). "Dr. Strangelove" explored "what might happen within
the Pentagon ... if some maniac Air Force general should suddenly order a
nuclear attack on the Soviet Union". One reviewer called the movie "one of the
cleverest and most incisive satiric thrusts at the awkwardness and folly of the
military that has ever been on the screen". "The China Syndrome" has been
described as a "gripping 1979 drama about the dangers of nuclear power" which
had an extra impact when the real-life accident at the Three Mile Island
nuclear plant occurred several weeks after the film opened. Jane Fonda plays a
TV reporter who witnesses a near-meltdown (the "China syndrome" of the title)
at a local nuclear plant, which was averted by a quick-thinking engineer,
played by Jack Lemmon. The plot suggests that corporate greed and cost-cutting
"have led to potentially deadly faults in the plant's construction". "Silkwood"
was inspired by the true-life story of Karen Silkwood, who died in a suspicious
car accident while investigating alleged wrongdoing at the Kerr-McGee plutonium
plant where she worked. Musicians United for Safe Energy (MUSE) was a musical
group founded in 1979 by Jackson Browne, Graham Nash, Bonnie Raitt, and John
Hall, following the Three Mile Island nuclear accident. The group organized a
series of five "No Nukes" concerts held at Madison Square Garden in New York
City in September 1979. On September 23, 1979, almost 200,000 people attended a
large anti-nuclear rally staged by MUSE on the then-empty north end of the
Battery Park City landfill in New York. The album "No Nukes", and a film, also
titled "No Nukes", were both released in 1980 to document the performances. In
2007, Bonnie Raitt, Graham Nash, and Jackson Browne, as part of the No Nukes
group, recorded a music video of the Buffalo Springfield song "For What It's
Worth". Impact on policy. Historian Lawrence S. Wittner has argued that anti-
nuclear sentiment and activism led directly to government policy shifts about
nuclear weapons. Public opinion influenced policymakers by limiting their
options and also by forcing them to follow certain policies over others.
Wittner credits public pressure and anti-nuclear activism with "Truman‚Äôs
decision to explore the Baruch Plan, Eisenhower‚Äôs efforts towards a nuclear
test ban and the 1958 testing moratorium, and Kennedy‚Äôs signing of the
Partial Test Ban Treaty". In terms of nuclear power, "Forbes" magazine, in the
September 1975 issue, reported that "the anti-nuclear coalition has been
remarkably successful ... has certainly slowed the expansion of nuclear power."
California has banned the approval of new nuclear reactors since the late 1970s
because of concerns over waste disposal, and some other U.S. states have a
moratorium on construction of nuclear power plants. Between 1975 and 1980, a
total of 63 nuclear units were canceled in the USA. Anti-nuclear activities
were among the reasons, but the primary motivations were the overestimation of
future demand for electricity and steadily increasing capital costs, which made
the economics of new plants unfavorable. The proliferation of nuclear weapons
became a presidential priority issue for the Carter Administration in the late
1970s. To deal with proliferation problems, President Carter promoted stronger
international control over nuclear technology, including nuclear reactor
technology. Although a strong supporter of nuclear power generally, Carter
turned against the breeder reactor because the plutonium it produced could be
diverted into nuclear weapons. For many years after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster
nuclear power was off the policy agenda in most countries. In recent years,
intense public relations activities by the nuclear industry, increasing
evidence of climate change and failures to address it, have brought nuclear
power issues back to the forefront of policy discussion in the nuclear
renaissance countries. But some countries are not prepared to expand nuclear
power and are still divesting themselves of their nuclear legacy. Under the
"New Zealand Nuclear Free Zone, Disarmament, and Arms Control Act 1987", all
territorial sea and land of New Zealand is declared a nuclear free zone.
Nuclear-powered and nuclear-armed ships are prohibited from entering the
country's territorial waters. Dumping of foreign radioactive waste and
development of nuclear weapons in the country is outlawed. Despite common
misconception, this act does not make nuclear power plants illegal. A 2008
survey shows that 19% of New Zealanders favour nuclear power as the best energy
source, while 77% prefer wind power as the best energy source. Ireland has no
plans to change its non-nuclear stance and pursue nuclear power in the future.
In the United States, the Navajo Nation forbids uranium mining and processing
in its land. In the United States, a 2007 University of Maryland survey showed
that 73 percent of the public surveyed favours the elimination of all nuclear
weapons, 64 percent support removing all nuclear weapons from high alert, and
59 percent support reducing U.S. and Russian nuclear stockpiles to 400 weapons
each. Given the unpopularity of nuclear weapons, U.S. politicians have been
wary of supporting new nuclear programs. Republican-dominated congresses "have
defeated the Bush administration's plan to build so-called 'bunker-busters' and
'mini-nukes'." As of 2011, Australia has no nuclear power stations and the
current Gillard Labor government is opposed to nuclear power for Australia.
Australia also has no nuclear weapons. Today, some 26,000 nuclear weapons
remain in the arsenals of the nine nuclear powers, with thousands on hair-
trigger alert. Although U.S., Russian, and British nuclear arsenals are
shrinking in size, those in the four Asian nuclear nations‚ÄîChina, India,
Pakistan, and North Korea‚Äîare growing, in large part because of tensions
among them. This Asian arms race also has possibilities of bringing Japan into
the nuclear club. During Barack Obama's successful U.S. presidential election
campaign, he advocated the abolition of nuclear weapons. Since his election he
has reiterated this goal in several major policy addresses. In 2010, the Obama
administration negotiated a new weapons accord with Russia for a reduction of
the maximum number of deployed nuclear weapons on each side from 2,200 to
between 1,500 and 1,675‚Äîa reduction of some 30 percent. In addition,
President Obama has committed $15 billion over the next five years to improving
the safety of the nuclear weapons stockpile. Following the 2011 Japanese
nuclear accidents, the Italian government put a one-year moratorium on plans to
revive nuclear power. On 11‚Äî12 June 2011, Italian voters passed a referendum
to cancel plans for new reactors. Over 94% of the electorate voted in favor of
the construction ban, with 55% of the eligible voters participating, making the
vote binding. German Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition announced on May 30,
2011, that Germany‚Äôs 17 nuclear power stations will be shut down by 2022, in
a policy reversal following Japan's Fukushima I nuclear accidents and anti-
nuclear protests within Germany. Seven of the German power stations were closed
temporarily in March, and they will remain off-line and be permanently
decommissioned. An eighth was already off line, and will stay so. Public
opinion surveys on nuclear issues. In 2005, the International Atomic Energy
Agency presented the results of a series of public opinion surveys in the
"Global Public Opinion on Nuclear Issues" report. Majorities of respondents in
14 of the 18 countries surveyed believe that the risk of terrorist acts
involving radioactive materials at nuclear facilities is high, because of
insufficient protection. While majorities of citizens generally support the
continued use of existing nuclear power reactors, most people do not favour the
building of new nuclear plants, and 25% of respondents feel that all nuclear
power plants should be closed down. Stressing the climate change benefits of
nuclear energy positively influences 10% of people to be more supportive of
expanding the role of nuclear power in the world, but there is still a general
reluctance to support the building of more nuclear power plants. There is
little support across the world for building new nuclear reactors, a 2011 poll
for the BBC indicates. The global research agency GlobeScan, commissioned by
BBC News, polled 23,231 people in 23 countries from July to September 2011,
several months after the Fukushima nuclear disaster. In countries with existing
nuclear programmes, people are significantly more opposed than they were in
2005, with only the UK and US bucking the trend. Most believe that boosting
energy efficiency and renewable energy can meet their needs. Anti-nuclear
organizations. Anti-nuclear groups have undertaken public protests and acts of
civil disobedience which have included occupations of nuclear plant sites.
Other salient strategies have included lobbying, petitioning government
authorities, influencing public policy through referendum campaigns and
involvement in elections. Anti-nuclear groups have also tried to influence
policy implementation through litigation and by participating in licencing
proceedings. Anti-nuclear power organisations have emerged in every country
that has had a nuclear power programme. Protest movements against nuclear power
first emerged in the USA, at the local level, and spread quickly to Europe and
the rest of the world. National nuclear campaigns emerged in the late 1970s.
Fuelled by the Three Mile Island accident and the Chernobyl disaster, the anti-
nuclear power movement mobilised political and economic forces which for some
years "made nuclear energy untenable in many countries". Some of these anti-
nuclear power organisations are reported to have developed considerable
expertise on nuclear power and energy issues. In 1992, the chairman of the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission said that "his agency had been pushed in the
right direction on safety issues because of the pleas and protests of nuclear
watchdog groups". Criticism. Some environmentalists criticise the anti-nuclear
movement for under-stating the environmental costs of fossil fuels and non-
nuclear alternatives, and overstating the environmental costs of nuclear
energy. Of the numerous nuclear experts who have offered their expertise in
addressing controversies, Bernard Cohen, Professor Emeritus of Physics at the
University of Pittsburgh, is likely the most frequently cited. In his extensive
writings he examines the safety issues in detail. He is best known for
comparing nuclear safety to the relative safety of a wide range of other
phenomena. Anti-nuclear activists are accused of representing the risks of
nuclear power in an unfair way. "The War Against the Atom" (Basic Books, 1982)
Samuel MacCracken of Boston University argued that in 1982, 50,000 deaths per
year could be attributed directly to non-nuclear power plants, if fuel
production and transportation, as well as pollution, were taken into account.
He argued that if non-nuclear plants were judged by the same standards as
nuclear ones, each US non-nuclear power plant could be held responsible for
about 100 deaths per year. The Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) is the main lobby
group for companies doing nuclear work in the USA, while most countries that
employ nuclear energy have a national industry group. The World Nuclear
Association is the only global trade body. In seeking to counteract the
arguments of nuclear opponents, it points to independent studies that quantify
the costs and benefits of nuclear energy and compares them to the costs and
benefits of alternatives. NEI sponsors studies of its own, but it also
references studies performed for the World Health Organisation, for the
International Energy Agency, and by university researchers. Critics of the
anti-nuclear movement point to independent studies that show that the capital
resources required for renewable energy sources are higher than those required
for nuclear power. Some people, including former opponents of nuclear energy,
criticise the movement on the basis of the claim that nuclear energy is
necessary for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. These individuals include
James Lovelock, originator of the Gaia hypothesis, Patrick Moore, a co-founder
of Greenpeace and former director of Greenpeace International, George Monbiot
and Stewart Brand, creator of the Whole Earth Catalog. Lovelock goes further to
refute claims about the danger of nuclear energy and its waste products. In a
January 2008 interview, Moore said that "It wasn't until after I'd left
Greenpeace and the climate change issue started coming to the forefront that I
started rethinking energy policy in general and realised that I had been
incorrect in my analysis of nuclear as being some kind of evil plot." 2
emissions associated with burning carbon-based fuels, have switched from anti-
to pro-nuclear power in recent years, it is clear that many ‚Äî if not most ‚Äî
of the militant environmentalist organizations remain adamantly opposed to the
expansion of nuclear power. Many even propose decommissioning and dismantling
the existing nuclear power electrical plants. In April 2007, Dan Becker,
Director of Global Warming for the Sierra Club, declared, "Switching from dirty
coal plants to dangerous nuclear power is like giving up smoking cigarettes and
taking up crack." James Lovelock, who originally proposed the Gaia hypothesis,
criticizes holders of such a view: "Opposition to nuclear energy is based on
irrational fear fed by Hollywood-style fiction, the Green lobbies and the
media." ". . .I am a Green and I entreat my friends in the movement to drop
their wrongheaded objection to nuclear energy." The German decision to phase
out nuclear power after the Fukushima accident is also regarded as irrational
fear driving energy policy. The switch to other forms of energy is expected to
cost around $340 billion over 10 years in required investments alone (which
represents over 3% of German GDP), The German shift is already increasing
carbon emissions and electricity prices in Germany, and might endanger the
shift away from coal power in Europe. Furthermore the expected increased demand
for natural gas that Germany will require to run it's economy is causing Russia
to extend the lives of its RBMK (Chernobyl-type) reactors in order to be able
to sell more of its gas to Germany. Therefore the German anti-Nuclear movement
is counterproductive as it is causing far reaching unintended consequences,
essentially by turning off it's more advanced Nuclear reactors it is putting
incentives on Russia to continue to run their older more dangerous reactors.
George Monbiot, an English writer known for his environmental and political
activism, once expressed deep antipathy to the nuclear industry. He finally
rejected his later neutral position regarding nuclear power in March 2011.
Although he "still loathethe liars who run the nuclear industry", Monbiot now
advocates its use, having been convinced of its relative safety by what he
considers the limited effects of the 2011 Japan tsunami on nuclear reactors in
the region. Subsequently, he has harshly condemned the anti-nuclear movement,
writing that it "has misled the world about the impacts of radiation on human
health ... made [claims ungrounded in science, unsupportable when challenged
and wildly wrong." He singled out Helen Caldicott for, he wrote, making
unsourced and inaccurate claims, dismissing contrary evidence as part of a
cover-up, and overstating the death toll from the Chernobyl disaster by a
factor of more than 140.
