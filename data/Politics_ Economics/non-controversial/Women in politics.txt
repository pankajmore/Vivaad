Women in government Women in government in the modern era are under-represented
in most countries worldwide, in contrast to men. However, women are
increasingly being politically elected to be heads of state and government.
More than 20 countries currently have a woman holding office as the head of a
national government, and the global participation rate of women in national-
level parliaments is nearly 20%. A number of countries are exploring measures
that may increase women's participation in government at all levels, from the
local to the national. Importance. Increasing women‚Äôs representation in the
government can empower women. Increasing women‚Äôs representation in government
is necessary to achieve gender parity. This notion of women‚Äôs empowerment is
rooted in the human capabilities approach, in which individuals are empowered
to choose the functioning that they deem valuable. Women, as the conventional
primary caretakers of children, often have a more prominent role than men in
advocating for children, resulting in a ‚Äúdouble dividend‚Äù in terms of the
benefits of women‚Äôs representation. Female representatives not only advance
women‚Äôs rights, but also advance the rights of children. In national
legislatures, there is a notable trend of women advancing gender and family-
friendly legislation. This advocacy has been seen in countries ranging from
France, Sweden and the Netherlands, to South Africa, Rwanda, and Egypt.
Furthermore, a number of studies from both industrialized and developed
countries indicate that women in local government tend to advance social
issues. In India, for instance, greater women‚Äôs representation has
corresponded with a more equitable distribution of community resources,
including more gender-sensitive spending on programs related to health,
nutrition, and education. In 1954, the United Nations "Convention on the
Political Rights of Women" went into force, enshrining women's equal rights to
vote, hold office, and access public services as provided for male citizens
within national laws. Challenges faced by women. Women face numerous obstacles
in achieving representation in governance. Their participation has been limited
by the assumption that women‚Äôs proper sphere is the ‚Äúprivate‚Äù sphere.
Whereas the ‚Äúpublic‚Äù domain is one of political authority and contestation,
the ‚Äúprivate‚Äù realm is associated with the family and the home. By
relegating women to the private sphere, their ability to enter the political
arena is curtailed. Gender inequality within families, inequitable division of
labor within households, and cultural attitudes about gender roles further
subjugate women and serve to limit their representation in public life.
Societies that are highly patriarchal often have local power structures that
make it difficult for women to combat. Thus, their interests are often not
represented. Even once elected, women tend to hold lesser valued cabinet
ministries or similar positions. These are described as ‚Äúsoft industries‚Äù
and include health, education, and welfare. Rarely do women hold executive
decision-making authority in more powerful domains or those that are associated
with traditional notions of masculinity (such as finance and the military).
Typically, the more powerful the institution, the less likely it is that
women‚Äôs interests will be represented. Additionally, in more autocratic
nations, women are less likely to have their interests represented. Many women
attain political standing due to kinship ties, as they have male family members
who are involved in politics. These women tend to be from higher income, higher
status families and thus may not be as focused on the issues faced by lower
income families. Challenges within political parties. In Canada, there is
evidence that female politicians face gender stigma from male members of the
political parties to which they belong, which can undermine the ability of
women to reach or maintain leadership roles. Pauline Marois, leader of the
Parti Quebecois (PQ) and the official opposition of the National Assembly of
Quebec, was the subject of a claim by Claude Pinard, a PQ "backbencher", that
many Quebecers do not support a female politician: "I believe that one of her
serious handicaps is the fact she's a woman [...] I sincerely believe that a
good segment of the population won't support her because she's a woman". A 2000
study that analyzed 1993 election results in Canada found that among "similarly
situated women and men candidates", women actually had a small vote advantage.
The study showed that neither voter turnout nor urban/rural constituencies were
factors that help or hurt a female candidate, but "office-holding experience in
non-political organizations made a modest contribution to women's electoral
advantage". Within Quebec itself, Don McPherson pointed out that Pinard himself
has enjoyed greater electoral success with Pauline Marois as party leader than
under a previous male party leader, when Pinard failed to be elected in his
riding. Demographically, Pinard's electoral riding is rural, with "relatively
older, less-well educated voters". National representation. As of March 31,
2012, the global average of women in national assemblies is 19.7%. Women in
national parliaments. The major English-speaking democracies are placed mostly
in the top 40% of the ranked countries. New Zealand ranks at position 23 with
women comprising 32.2% of its lower house in parliament. Australia (24.7% in
the lower house, 29% in the upper house) and Canada (24.7% lower house, 39%
upper house) rank at position 40 out of 189 countries. The United Kingdom is
ranked at 55 (22.3% lower house, 21.9% upper house), while the United States
ranks 78 (16.9% in the lower house, 17.0% in the upper house). It should be
noted that not all of these lower and/or upper houses in national parliaments
are democratically elected; for example, in Canada members of the upper house
(the Senate) are appointed. In a small number of countries, for example Saudi
Arabia, women's suffrage does not exist, and therefore there is a 0%
representation of women in the national government. Policies to increase
women‚Äôs participation. The United Nations has identified six avenues by which
female participation in politics and government may be strengthened. These
avenues are: equalization of educational opportunities, quotas for female
participation in governing bodies, legislative reform to increase focus on
issues concerning women and children, financing gender-responsive budgets to
equally take into account the needs of men and women, increasing the presence
of sex-disaggregated statistics in national research/data, and furthering the
presence and agency of grassroots women‚Äôs empowerment movements Quotas. Quota
usage can have marked effects on female representation in governance. In 1995,
Rwanda ranked 24th in terms of female representation, and jumped to 1st in 2003
after quotas were introduced. Similar effects can be seen in Argentina, Iraq,
Burundi, Mozambique, and South Africa, for example. Of the top-ranked 20
countries in terms of female representation in government, 17 of these
countries utilize some sort of quota system to ensure female inclusion. Though
such inclusion is mainly instituted at the national level, there have been
efforts in India to addresses female inclusion at the subnational level,
through quotas for parliamentary positions. Financing. A sex-responsive budget
may also work to address issues of unpaid care work and caring labor gaps.
Research/data improvements. Current research which uses sex-aggregated
statistics may underplay or minimize the quantitative presentation of issues
such as maternal mortality, violence against women, and girls‚Äô school
attendance. Sex-disaggregated statistics are lacking in the assessment of
maternal mortality rates, for example. Prior to UNICEF and UNIFEM efforts to
gather more accurate and comprehensive data, 62 countries had no recent
national data available regarding maternal mortality rates. Only 38 countries
have sex-disaggregated statistics available to report frequency of violence
against women. 41 countries collect sex-disaggregated data on school
attendance, while 52 countries assess sex-disaggregated wage statistics.
Grassroots women‚Äôs empowerment movements. Women‚Äôs informal collectives are
crucial to improving the standard of living for women worldwide. Collectives
can address such issues as nutrition, education, shelter, food distribution,
and generally improved standard of living. Empowering such collectives can
increase their reach to the women most in need of support and empowerment. Case
studies. Finland. The Finnish national quota law, introduced in 1995, mandates
that among all indirectly elected public bodies (at both a national and a local
level), at least 40% of the governing body must be female. The 1995 laws was a
reformed version of a similar 1986 law. Unlike other countries‚Äô quota laws,
which affect party structure or electoral candidate lists, the Finnish law
addresses indirectly elected bodies (nominated by official authorities)‚Äîthe
law does not address popularly elected bodies. The Finnish law heavily
emphasizes local municipal boards and other subnational institutions. From 1993
(pre-quota law) to 1997 (post-quota law), the proportion of women on municipal
executive boards increased from 25% to 45%. The quota law also affected gender
segregation in local governance: before the passage of the law, there had been
a gender imbalance in terms of female overrepresentation in ‚Äúsoft-sector‚Äù
boards (those concerned with health, education, etc.) and female
underrepresentation in ‚Äúhard-sector‚Äù boards (those concerned with economics
and technology). In 1997, the boards were balanced horizontally. However, areas
not subject to quota laws continue to be imbalanced. In 2003, it was determined
that only 16% of the chairs of municipal executive boards are female‚Äîchair
positions in this area are not quota-regulated. Spain. In 2007, Spain passed
the Equality Law, requiring a ‚Äúprinciple of balanced presence‚Äù by mandating
political parties to include 40-60% of each sex among electoral candidates.
This law is unique in that surpasses the 40% parity figure established by the
European Commission in 1998; a figure which (according to the EC) indicates
‚Äúparity democracy.‚Äù Though there is anecdotal of increasing female
representation on a local and national level, there has not yet been national-
level data to quantitatively bolster this assertion. India. In an effort to
increase women‚Äôs participation in politics in India, a 1993 constitutional
amendment mandated that a randomly selected third of leadership positions at
every level of local government be reserved for women. These political
reservation quotas randomly choose one third of cities to implement a women-
only election. In these cities, parties are forced to either give a ticket to a
women candidate or choose to not run in those locations. Due to the randomized
selection of cities who must enforce the reservation for women each election
year, some cities have implemented the quota multiple times, once or never.
This addresses the political discrimination of women at various levels: parties
are forced to give women the opportunity to run, the women candidates are not
disadvantaged by a male incumbent or general biases for male over female
leadership, and the pool of women candidates is increased because of the
guaranteed opportunity for female participation. The effects of the quota
system in India have been studied by various researchers. In Mumbai, it was
found that the probability of a women winning office conditional on the
constituency being reserved for women in the previous election is approximately
five times the probability of a women winning office if the constituency had
not been reserved for women‚Äù. Furthermore that even when the mandates are
withdrawn, women were still able to keep their positions of leadership. Given
the opportunity to get a party ticket, create a platform and obtain the
experience to run for a political position, women are much more likely to be
able to overcome these hurdles in the future, even without the quota system in
place. The quota system has also affected policy choices. Research in West
Bengal and Rajasthan has indicated that reservation affected policy choices in
ways that seem to better reflect women‚Äôs preferences. In terms of voter's
perception of female leaders, reservation did not improve the implicit or
explicit distaste for female leaders‚Äîin fact, the relative explicit
preference for male leaders was actually strengthened in villages that had
experienced a quota. However, while reservation did not make male villagers
more sympathetic to the idea of female leaders, it caused them to recognize
that women could lead. Moreover the reservation policy significantly improved
women‚Äôs prospects in elections open to both sexes, but only after two rounds
of reservation within the same village. Political reservation for women has
also impacted the aspirations and educational attainment for teenage girls in
India. Rwanda. Since the election of 2008, Rwanda is the first country to have
a majority of women in legislature. Rwanda is an example of a developing
country that does not have spectacular gender equality in other aspects of
society, but radically increased its female leadership because of national
conflict. After the genocide that killed 800,000 Tutsis in 100 days, women in
legislature went from 18% women before the conflict to 56% in 2008. Two pieces
of legislature enabled and supported women into leadership positions: the
Security Council Resolution of 1325 urged women to take part in the post-
conflict reconstruction and the 2003 Rwandan Constitution included a mandated
quota of 30% reserved seats for all women in legislature. Of the 24 women who
gained seats directly after the quota implementation in 2003, many joined
political parties and chose to run again. Once again we can see the quota
working as an ‚Äúincubator‚Äù for giving women confidence, experience, and
driving women‚Äôs participation in leadership. It is argued that the increase
of female leadership in Rwanda also led to an increase in gender equality.
World Focus (2009) writes, ‚ÄúRwandan voters have elected women in numbers well
beyond the mandates dictated by the post-genocide constitution. And though
women in Rwanda still face discrimination, female legislators have influenced
major reforms in banking and property laws.‚Äù A parliamentary women‚Äôs caucus
in Rwanda (FFRP) has also ‚Äúled a successful effort to pass ground-breaking
legislation on gender-based violence in part by involving and garnering support
from their male colleagues‚Äù. While some researchers see reform, others see
dominant party tactics. Hassim (2009) writes, ‚ÄúIt could be argued that in
both countries and Rwanda women‚Äôs representation provided a kind of alibi for
the progressive, ‚Äòdemocratic‚Äô nature of new governments that at their core
nevertheless remained authoritarian, and increasingly so‚Äù. Rwanda shows that
increased women participation in democracy tends leads to progress in gender
equal legislature and reform, but research must be careful not to immediately
relate increased gender equality in politics to increased gender equality in
policy. Germany. The gender quotas implemented across parties in Germany in the
1990s serve as a natural experiment for the effect of sub-national party
political gender quotas on women participation. Davidson-Schmich (2006) notes,
‚Äúthe German case provides the variance needed to explain the successful (or
failed) implementation of these political party quotas‚Äù. Germany‚Äôs sixteen
state legislatures, the Lander, feature a variety of party systems and varied
number of potential female candidates. Germany is rated highly in its gender
gap, but is an example of a developed country with a low percentage of female
leadership in politics. Davidson-Schmich‚Äôs study shows that there are many
factors that influence how effective a political quota for women will be.
Because Germany‚Äôs quotas cover culturally diverse areas, Davidson-Schmich was
able to see which cities best responded to the increase in women running for
office. In his bivariate study, the quota was more successful when the city had
a PR electoral system, when more women held inner-party and local political
offices, and when there were more women in state-level executive offices. The
quota was less successful in rural areas, areas with a large number of Catholic
voters, electoral systems with a preferential system, in extremely competitive
party systems, and with greater rates of legislative turnover. In his
multivariate study of these regions, however, Davidson-Schmich narrowed these
factors down even further to the most significant variables of: Catholicism and
agricultural economics (Davidson-Schmich, 2006, p.¬ 228). This is very
intriguing, and as he explains, ‚Äúthe success of voluntary gender quotas in
the German states hinged not on the political structure of these Lander, but
rather the willingness of within the system to act on the opportunities
inherent in these structures‚Äù (Davidson-Schmich, 2006, p.¬ 228). Social
factors and inherent gender discrimination are more important in the success of
a female political quota than the structure of the quota itself. The United
States. In the United States no political gender quotas exist, mandatory or
voluntary. The proportion of women in leadership roles in the Senate, House of
Representatives, and Presidential positions reflect this. The current position
of women representation in the U.S. is precarious. In the elections of 2012,
the greatest number of female incumbents ever will be up for re-election in the
Senate. Ten female Democrats, six of them incumbents, are nominated, with one
Republican nominated for Senate running for office. Steinhauer notes that in
Congress, both in the Senate and the House of Representatives, women
historically and currently lack representation. The results from the 2012
election could greatly effect women representation in the Senate: ‚ÄúIf all or
most of the incumbent women prevail in 2012, and even just a few women of the
many recruited win new seats, women would reach an all-time high in the Senate.
But the loss of just one female Senate seat with no replacements would cost
women ground in the Senate for the first time since 1978, when the number of
women in the Senate went to one from two‚Äù. With the 2012 elections women
Senators could either make the highest percentage of seats or the lowest
proportion since 1978. Women in government office. Women in politics have
historically been under-represented in Western societies compared to men. Some
women, however, have been politically elected to be heads of state and
government. Women as cabinet ministers. Women holding prominent cabinet posts
have grown in numbers worldwide during the 20th and 21st centuries, and in
recent years have increasingly held the top profile portfolios for their
governments in non-traditional areas for women in government, such as national
security and defense, finance, revenue and foreign relations. Comparing women's
integration into branches of government. Executive branch. Women have been
notably underrepresented in the executive branch of government. The gender gap
has been closing, however, albeit slowly The first women other than monarchs to
hold head of state positions were in socialist countries. The first was Khertek
Anchimaa-Toka of the Tuvan People's Republic from 1940‚Äì1944, followed by
S√ºkhbaataryn Yanjmaa of the Mongolian People's Republic 1953-1954 and Soong
Ching-ling of the People's Republic of China from 1968‚Äì1972 and 1981.
Following the socialist countries, the Nordic countries have been forerunners
in including women in the executive branch. The second cabinet Brundtland
(1986‚Äì1989) was historical in that 8 out of 18 cabinet members were women,
and in 2007 the second cabinet Stoltenberg (2005‚Äìpresent) was more than 50%
women. Some current female politicians that have reached top positions in the
Nordic countries are the President of Finland, Tarja Halonen and Deputy Prime
Minister of Sweden, Maud Olofsson. In 2003, Finland had a historical moment
when all top leaders of the country were women and also represented different
political parties: Social democrat Tarja Halonen was President, Riitta
Uosukainen from National Coalition Party was Speaker of the Parliament and
after the parliamentary elections of 2003 Anneli J√§√§tteenm√§ki from Center
party was on her way to become the first female Prime Minister of Finland. By
June 22, 2010 Mari Kiviniemi of the Centre Party was appointed the second
female Prime Minister of Finland. The world's first elected female president
was Vigd√≠s Finnbogad√≥ttir of Iceland, whose term lasted from 1980 to 1996. In
2005, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia became Africa's first elected female
head of state. Legislative branch. It was not until World War I and the first
socialist revolutions that the first few women became members of governments.
Alexandra Kollontai became the first female to hold a minister position, as the
People's Commissar for Social Welfare in Soviet Russia in 1917. Nina Bang,
Danish Minister of Education from 1924‚Äì26, was the world's second full female
cabinet minister. The first female head of government was Evgenia Bosh, the
Bolshevik military leader who held the People's Secretary of Internal Affairs
position in the Ukraine People's Republic of the Soviets of Workers and
Peasants from 1917‚Äì1918, which was responsible for executive functions.
Nevertheless, development was slow and it was not until the end of the 20th
century that female ministers stopped being unusual. The first government
organization formed with the goal of women's equality was the Zhenotdel, in
Soviet Russia. According to a 2006 report by the Inter-Parliamentary Union, 16%
of all parliament members in the world are female. In 1995, the United Nations
set a goal of 30% female representation. The current annual growth rate of
women in national parliaments is about 0.5% worldwide. At this rate, gender
parity in national legislatures will not be achieved until 2068. The top ten
countries in terms of number of female parliamentary members are Rwanda with
56.3%, Sweden (47.0%), Cuba (43.2%), Finland (41.5%), the Netherlands (41.3%),
Argentina (40.0%), Denmark (38.0%), Angola (37.3%), Costa Rica (36.8%), Spain
(36.3%). In the United States in 2008, the New Hampshire State Senate became
the first state legislature upper house to possess an elected female majority.
The United Kingdom and United States are roughly in line with the world
average. The House of Lords has 139 women (19.7%), while there are 125 women
(19.4%) in the British House of Commons. Local representation. There has been
an increasing focus on women‚Äôs representation at a local level. Most of this
research is focused on developing countries. Governmental decentralization
often results in local government structures that are more open to the
participation of women, both as elected local councilors and as the clients of
local government services. A 2003 survey conducted by United Cities and Local
Governments (UCLG), a global network supporting inclusive local governments,
found that the average proportion of women in local council was 15%. In
leadership positions, the proportion of women was lower: for instance, 5% of
mayors of Latin American municipalities are women. According to a comparative
study of women in local governments in East Asia and the Pacific, women have
been more successful in reaching decision-making position in local governments
than at the national level. Local governments tend to be more accessible and
have more available positions. Also, women‚Äôs role in local governments may be
more accepted because they are seen as an extension of their involvement in the
community. Indian panchayats. The local panchayat system in India provides an
example of women‚Äôs representation at the local governmental level. The 73rd
and 74th Constitutional Amendments in 1992 mandated panchayat elections
throughout the country. The reforms reserved 33% of the seats for women and for
castes and tribes proportional to their population. Over 700,000 women were
elected after the reforms were implemented in April 1993.
