Hyperinflation In economics, hyperinflation occurs when a country experiences
very high, accelerating, and perceptibly "unstoppable" rates of inflation. In
such a condition, the general price level within an economy rapidly increases
as the currency quickly loses real value. Meanwhile, the real values of
specific economic items generally stay the same with respect to each other, and
in terms of other relatively stable foreign currencies. This includes the
economic items that generally constitute the government's expenses. The
difference between inflation and hyperinflation is technically one of degrees
(see the "definitions" section below). Unlike regular inflation, where this
process is protracted and not generally noticeable except perhaps by studying
past market prices, hyperinflation sees a rapid and continuing increase in the
supply of money, and the cost of goods. Hyperinflation is often associated with
wars, their aftermath, sociopolitical upheavals, or other crises that make it
difficult for the government to tax the population, as a sudden and sharp
decrease in tax revenue coupled with a strong effort to maintain the status quo
can be a direct trigger of hyperinflation. Definitions. In 1956, Phillip Cagan
wrote "The Monetary Dynamics of Hyperinflation", generally regarded as the
first serious study of hyperinflation and its effects. In it, he defined a
hyperinflationary episode as starting in the month that the monthly inflation
rate exceeds 50%, and it ending when the monthly inflation rate drops below 50%
and stays that way for at least a year. Economists usually follow Cagan‚Äôs
description that hyperinflation occurs when the monthly inflation rate exceeds
50%. The International Accounting Standards Board does not establish an
absolute rate at which hyperinflation is deemed to arise. Instead, it lists
factors that indicate the existence of hyperinflation: Causes. Hyperinflation
occurs when there is a continuing (and often accelerating) rapid increase in
the amount of money that is not supported by a corresponding growth in the
output of goods and services. The price increases that result from the rapid
money creation creates a vicious circle, requiring ever growing amounts of new
money creation to fund government activities. Hence both monetary inflation and
price inflation proceed at a rapid pace. Such rapidly increasing prices cause
widespread unwillingness of the local population to hold the local currency as
it rapidly loses its buying power. Instead they quickly spend any money they
receive, which increases the velocity of money flow; this in turn causes
further acceleration in prices. This results in an imbalance between the supply
and demand for the money (including currency and bank deposits), causing rapid
inflation. Very high inflation rates can result in a loss of confidence in the
currency, similar to a bank run. Usually, the excessive money supply growth
results from the government being either unable or unwilling to fully finance
the government budget through taxation or borrowing, and instead it finances
the government budget deficit through the printing of money. Governments have
sometimes resorted to excessively loose monetary policy, as it allows a
government to devalue its debts and reduce (or avoid) a tax increase. Inflation
is effectively a regressive tax on the users of money, but less overt than
levied taxes and is therefore harder to understand by ordinary citizens.
Inflation can obscure quantitative assessments of the true cost of living, as
published price indices only look at data in retrospect, so may increase only
months later. Monetary inflation can become hyperinflation if monetary
authorities fail to fund increasing government expenses from taxes, government
debt, cost cutting, or by other means, because either Theories of
hyperinflation generally look for a relationship between seigniorage and the
inflation tax. In both Cagan's model and the neo-classical models, a tipping
point occurs when the increase in money supply or the drop in the monetary base
makes it impossible for a government to improve its financial position. Thus
when fiat money is printed, government obligations that are not denominated in
money increase in cost by more than the value of the money created. From this,
it might be wondered why any rational government would engage in actions that
cause or continue hyperinflation. One reason for such actions is that often the
alternative to hyperinflation is either depression or military defeat. The root
cause is a matter of more dispute. In both classical economics and monetarism,
it is always the result of the monetary authority irresponsibly borrowing money
to pay all its expenses. These models focus on the unrestrained seigniorage of
the monetary authority, and the gains from the inflation tax. In neo-classical
economic theory, hyperinflation is rooted in a deterioration of the monetary
base, that is the confidence that there is a store of value which the currency
will be able to command later. In this model, the perceived risk of holding
currency rises dramatically, and sellers demand increasingly high premiums to
accept the currency. This in turn leads to a greater fear that the currency
will collapse, causing even higher premiums. One example of this is during
periods of warfare, civil war, or intense internal conflict of other kinds:
governments need to do whatever is necessary to continue fighting, since the
alternative is defeat. Expenses cannot be cut significantly since the main
outlay is armaments. Further, a civil war may make it difficult to raise taxes
or to collect existing taxes. While in peacetime the deficit is financed by
selling bonds, during a war it is typically difficult and expensive to borrow,
especially if the war is going poorly for the government in question. The
banking authorities, whether central or not, "monetize" the deficit, printing
money to pay for the government's efforts to survive. The hyperinflation under
the Chinese Nationalists from 1939 to 1945 is a classic example of a government
printing money to pay civil war costs. By the end, currency was flown in over
the Himalayas, and then old currency was flown out to be destroyed.
Hyperinflation is regarded as a complex phenomenon and one explanation may not
be applicable to all cases. However, in both of these models, whether loss of
confidence comes first, or central bank seigniorage, the other phase is
ignited. In the case of rapid expansion of the money supply, prices rise
rapidly in response to the increased supply of money relative to the supply of
goods and services, and in the case of loss of confidence, the monetary
authority responds to the risk premiums it has to pay by ‚Äúrunning the
printing presses.‚Äù Nevertheless the immense acceleration process that occurs
during hyperinflation (such as during the German hyperinflation of 1922/23)
still remains unclear and unpredictable. The transformation of an inflationary
development into the hyperinflation has to be identified as a very complex
phenomenon, which could be a further advanced research avenue of the complexity
economics in conjunction with research areas like mass hysteria, bandwagon
effect, social brain and mirror neurons. Models. Since hyperinflation is
visible as a monetary effect, models of hyperinflation center on the demand for
money. Economists see both a rapid increase in the money supply and an increase
in the velocity of money if the (monetary) inflating is not stopped. Either
one, or both of these together are the root causes of inflation and
hyperinflation. A dramatic increase in the velocity of money as the cause of
hyperinflation is central to the "crisis of confidence" model of
hyperinflation, where the risk premium that sellers demand for the paper
currency over the nominal value grows rapidly. The second theory is that there
is first a radical increase in the amount of circulating medium, which can be
called the "monetary model" of hyperinflation. In either model, the second
effect then follows from the first ‚Äî either too little confidence forcing an
increase in the money supply, or too much money destroying confidence. In the
"confidence model", some event, or series of events, such as defeats in battle,
or a run on stocks of the specie which back a currency, removes the belief that
the authority issuing the money will remain solvent ‚Äî whether a bank or a
government. Because people do not want to hold notes which may become
valueless, they want to spend them. Sellers, realizing that there is a higher
risk for the currency, demand a greater and greater premium over the original
value. Under this model, the method of ending hyperinflation is to change the
backing of the currency, often by issuing a completely new one. War is one
commonly cited cause of crisis of confidence, particularly losing in a war, as
occurred during Napoleonic Vienna, and capital flight, sometimes because of
‚Äúcontagion‚Äù is another. In this view, the increase in the circulating
medium is the result of the government attempting to buy time without coming to
terms with the root cause of the lack of confidence itself. In the "monetary
model", hyperinflation is a positive feedback cycle of rapid monetary
expansion. It has the same cause as all other inflation: money-issuing bodies,
central or otherwise, produce currency to pay spiralling costs, often from lax
fiscal policy, or the mounting costs of warfare. When businesspeople perceive
that the issuer is committed to a policy of rapid currency expansion, they mark
up prices to cover the expected decay in the currency's value. The issuer must
then accelerate its expansion to cover these prices, which pushes the currency
value down even faster than before. According to this model the issuer cannot
"win" and the only solution is to abruptly stop expanding the currency.
Unfortunately, the end of expansion can cause a severe financial shock to those
using the currency as expectations are suddenly adjusted. This policy, combined
with reductions of pensions, wages, and government outlays, formed part of the
Washington consensus of the 1990s. Whatever the cause, hyperinflation involves
both the supply and velocity of money. Which comes first is a matter of debate,
and there may be no universal story that applies to all cases. But once the
hyperinflation is established, the pattern of increasing the money stock, by
whichever agencies are allowed to do so, is universal. Because this practice
increases the supply of currency without any matching increase in demand for
it, the price of the currency, that is the exchange rate, naturally falls
relative to other currencies. Inflation becomes hyperinflation when the
increase in money supply turns specific areas of pricing power into a general
frenzy of spending quickly before money becomes worthless. The purchasing power
of the currency drops so rapidly that holding cash for even a day is an
unacceptable loss of purchasing power. As a result, no one holds currency,
which increases the velocity of money, and worsens the crisis. Because rapidly
rising prices undermine the role of money as a store of value, people try to
spend it on real goods or services as quickly as possible. Thus, the monetary
model predicts that the velocity of money will increase as a result of an
excessive increase in the money supply. At the point when money velocity and
prices rapidly accelerate in a vicious circle, hyperinflation is out of
control, because ordinary policy mechanisms, such as increasing reserve
requirements, raising interest rates, or cutting government spending will be
ineffective and be responded to by shifting away from the rapidly devalued
money and towards other means of exchange. During a period of hyperinflation,
bank runs, loans for 24-hour periods, switching to alternate currencies, the
return to use of gold or silver or even barter become common. Many of the
people who hoard gold today expect hyperinflation, and are hedging against it
by holding specie. There may also be extensive capital flight or flight to a
‚Äúhard‚Äù currency such as the US dollar. This is sometimes met with capital
controls, an idea which has swung from standard, to anathema, and back into
semi-respectability. All of this constitutes an economy which is operating in
an ‚Äúabnormal‚Äù way, which may lead to decreases in real production. If so,
that intensifies the hyperinflation, since it means that the amount of goods in
"too much money chasing too few goods" formulation is also reduced. This is
also part of the vicious circle of hyperinflation. Once the vicious circle of
hyperinflation has been ignited, dramatic policy means are almost always
required, simply raising interest rates is insufficient. Bolivia, for example,
underwent a period of hyperinflation in 1985, where prices increased 12,000% in
the space of less than a year. The government raised the price of gasoline,
which it had been selling at a huge loss to quiet popular discontent, and the
hyperinflation came to a halt almost immediately, since it was able to bring in
hard currency by selling its oil abroad. The crisis of confidence ended, and
people returned deposits to banks. The German hyperinflation (1919-November
1923) was ended by producing a currency based on assets loaned against by
banks, called the Rentenmark. Hyperinflation often ends when a civil conflict
ends with one side winning. Although wage and price controls are sometimes used
to control or prevent inflation, no episode of hyperinflation has been ended by
the use of price controls alone. However, wage and price controls have
sometimes been part of the mix of policies used to halt hyperinflation.
Effects. Hyperinflation effectively wipes out the purchasing power of private
and public savings, distorts the economy in favor of the hoarding of real
assets, causes the monetary base, whether specie or hard currency, to flee the
country, and makes the afflicted area anathema to investment. Enactment of
price controls to prevent discounting the value of paper money relative to
gold, silver, hard currency, or commodities, fail to force acceptance of a
paper money which lacks intrinsic value. If the entity responsible for printing
a currency promotes excessive money printing, with other factors contributing a
reinforcing effect, hyperinflation usually continues. Hyperinflation is
generally associated with paper money, which can easily be used to increase the
money supply: add more zeros to the plates and print, or even stamp old notes
with new numbers. Historically, there have been numerous episodes of
hyperinflation in various countries followed by a return to "hard money". Older
economies would revert to hard currency and barter when the circulating medium
became excessively devalued, generally following a "run" on the store of value.
Much attention on hyperinflation centers on the effect on savers whose
investment becomes worthless. Academic economists seem not to have devoted much
study on the (positive) effect on debtors. This may be due to the widespread
perception that consistently saving a portion of one's income in monetary
investments such as bonds or interest-bearing accounts is almost always a wise
policy, and usually beneficial to the society of the savers. By contrast,
incurring large or long-term debts (though sometimes unavoidable) is viewed as
often resulting from irresponsibility or self-indulgence. Interest rate changes
often cannot keep up with hyperinflation or even high inflation, certainly with
contractually fixed interest rates. (For example, in the 1970s in the United
Kingdom inflation reached 25% per annum, yet interest rates did not rise above
15% ‚Äì and then only briefly ‚Äì and many fixed interest rate loans existed).
Contractually there is often no bar to a debtor clearing his long term debt
with "hyperinflated-cash" nor could a lender simply somehow suspend the loan.
"Early redemption penalties" were (and still are) often based on a penalty of
"x" months of interest/payment; again no real bar to paying off what had been a
large loan. In interwar Germany, for example, much private and corporate debt
was effectively wiped out; certainly for those holding fixed interest rate
loans. Aftermath. Hyperinflation is ended with drastic remedies, such as
imposing the shock therapy of slashing government expenditures or altering the
currency basis. One form this may take is dollarization, the use of a foreign
currency (not necessarily the U.S. dollar) as a national unit of currency. An
example was dollarization in Ecuador, initiated in September 2000 in response
to a 75% loss of value of the Ecuadorian sucre in early 2000. Hyperinflation
has always been a traumatic experience for the area which suffers it, and the
next policy regime almost always enacts policies to prevent its recurrence.
Often this means making the central bank very aggressive about maintaining
price stability, as was the case with the German Bundesbank or moving to some
hard basis of currency such as a currency board. Many governments have enacted
extremely stiff wage and price controls in the wake of hyperinflation but this
does not prevent further inflating of the money supply by its central bank, and
always leads to widespread shortages of consumer goods if the controls are
rigidly enforced. Currency. In countries experiencing hyperinflation, the
central bank often prints money in larger and larger denominations as the
smaller denomination notes become worthless. This can result in the production
of some interesting banknotes, including those denominated in amounts of
1,000,000,000 or more. One way to avoid the use of large numbers is by
declaring a new unit of currency (an example being, instead of 10,000,000,000
Dollars, a bank might set 1 new dollar = 1,000,000,000 old dollars, so the new
note would read "10 new dollars.") An example of this would be Turkey's
revaluation of the Lira on 1 January 2005, when the old Turkish lira (TRL) was
converted to the New Turkish lira (TRY) at a rate of 1,000,000 old to 1 new
Turkish Lira. While this does not lessen the actual value of a currency, it is
called redenomination or revaluation and also happens over time in countries
with standard inflation levels. During hyperinflation, currency inflation
happens so quickly that bills reach large numbers before revaluation. Some
banknotes were stamped to indicate changes of denomination. This is because it
would take too long to print new notes. By the time new notes were printed,
they would be obsolete (that is, they would be of too low a denomination to be
useful). Metallic coins were rapid casualties of hyperinflation, as the scrap
value of metal enormously exceeded the face value. Massive amounts of coinage
were melted down, usually illicitly, and exported for hard currency.
Governments will often try to disguise the true rate of inflation through a
variety of techniques. None of these actions addresse the root causes of
inflation and if discovered, they tend to further undermine trust in the
currency, causing further increases in inflation. Price controls will generally
result in shortages and hoarding and extremely high demand for the controlled
goods, causing disruptions of supply chains. Products available to consumers
may diminish or disappear as businesses no longer find it sufficiently
profitable (or may be operating at a loss) to continue producing and/or
distributing such goods at the legal prices, further exacerbating the
shortages. There are also issues with computerized money-handling systems. In
Zimbabwe, during the hyperinflation of the Zimbabwe dollar, many automated
teller machines and payment card machines struggled with arithmetic overflow
errors as customers required many billions and trillions of dollars at one
time. Examples of hyperinflation. The Hanke-Krus Hyperinflation Table. The
table to the right supplies, for the first time, a table that contains all 56
episodes of hyperinflation, including several which had previously gone
unreported. The Hanke-Krus Hyperinflation Table is compiled in a systematic and
uniform way. Most importantly, it meets the replicability test. It utilizes
clean and consistent inflation metrics, indicates the start and end dates of
each episode, identifies the month of peak hyperinflation, and signifies the
currency that was in circulation, as well as the method used to calculate
inflation rates. A printer-friendly version of the Hanke-Krus table is pages

high inflation from 1991 to 1995. It was a result of exchange restrictions
following the introduction of the novo kwanza (AON) to replace the original
kwanza (AOK) in 1990. At the first months of 1991, the highest denomination was
50¬ 000 AON. By 1994, the highest denomination was 500¬ 000 kwanzas. In the
1995 currency reform, the readjusted kwanza (AOR) replaced the novo kwanza at
the ratio of 1¬ 000 AON to 1 AOR, but hyperinflation continued as further
denominations of up to 5¬ 000¬ 000 AOR were issued. In the 1999 currency
reform, the kwanza (AOA) was reintroduced at the ratio of 1 million AOR to 1
AOA. Currently, the highest denomination banknote is 2¬ 000 AOA and the overall
impact of hyperinflation was 1 AOA = 1 billion AOK. Argentina. Argentina went
through steady inflation from 1975 to 1991. At the beginning of 1975, the
highest denomination was 1,000 pesos. In late 1976, the highest denomination
was 5,000 pesos. In early 1979, the highest denomination was 10,000 pesos. By
the end of 1981, the highest denomination was 1,000,000 pesos. In the 1983
currency reform, 1 peso argentino was exchanged for 10,000 pesos. In the 1985
currency reform, 1 austral was exchanged for 1,000 pesos argentinos. In the
1992 currency reform, 1 new peso was exchanged for 10,000 australes. The
overall impact of hyperinflation: 1 (1992) peso = 100,000,000,000 pre-1983
pesos. Armenia. Armenia experience high inflation and hyperinflation from
January 1992-December 1994. Its first episode of hyperinflation was due to the
use of the Russian ruble after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The second
episode was due to an unstable Armenian dram. Austria. In 1922, inflation in
Austria reached 1426%, and from 1914 to January 1923, the consumer price index
rose by a factor of 11836, with the highest banknote in denominations of
500,000 krones. Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan experienced inflation from January 1992
until December 1994. It first circulated the Russian Ruble until August 1992
when it introduced the Azerbaijani manat. Belarus. Belarus experienced steady
inflation from 1994 to 2002. In 1993, the highest denomination was 5,000
rublei. By 1999, it was 5,000,000 rublei. In the 2000 currency reform, the
ruble was replaced by the new ruble at an exchange rate of 1 new ruble = 1,000
old rublei. The highest denomination in 2008 was 100,000 rublei, equal to
100,000,000 pre-2000 rublei. Bolivia. Bolivia experienced its worst inflation
between 1984 and 1986. Before 1984, the highest denomination was 1,000 Bolivian
pesos. By 1985, the highest denomination was 10 million Bolivian pesos. In
1985, a Bolivian note for 1 million pesos was worth 55 cents in US dollars,
one-thousandth of its exchange value of $5,000 less than three years
previously. In the 1987 currency reform, the Peso Boliviano was replaced by the
Boliviano at a rate of 1,000,000 : 1. Bosnia and Herzegovina. Bosnia and
Herzegovina went through its worst inflation in 1992. In 1992, the highest
denomination was 1,000 dinara. By 1993, the highest denomination was
100,000,000 dinara. In the Republika Srpska, the highest denomination was
10,000 dinara in 1992 and 10,000,000,000 dinara in 1993. 50,000,000,000 dinara
notes were also printed in 1993 but never issued. Brazil. From 1967‚Äì1994, the
base currency unit was shifted seven times to adjust for inflation in the final
years of the Brazilian military dictatorship era. A 1967 cruzeiro was, in 1994,
worth less than one trillionth of a US cent, after adjusting for multiple
devaluations and note changes. In that same year, inflation reached a record
2,075.8%. A new currency called real was adopted in 1994, and hyperinflation
was eventually brought under control. The "real" was also the currency in use
until 1942; 1 (current) real is the equivalent of 2,750,000,000,000,000,000 of
Brazil's first currency (called "r√©is" in Portuguese). Bulgaria. Bulgaria
experience hyperinflation only in the month of February 1997. However, it had
high inflation for many years proceeding this episode. In order to curb
inflation, Bulgaria implemented a board in July of that year. Inflation
subsequently dropped almost immediately. Chile. In 1973, Chile had experienced
hyperinflation that had hit 700 percent, at a time when the country, under high
protectionist barriers, had no foreign reserves, and GDP was falling. Despite
very severe government cuts and attempted monetary targeting under the Pinochet
dictatorship inflation remained extremely high throughout the 1970s. China. As
the first user of fiat currency, China has had an early history of troubles
caused by hyperinflation. The Yuan Dynasty printed huge amounts of fiat paper
money to fund their wars, and the resulting hyperinflation, coupled with other
factors, led to its demise at the hands of a revolution. The Republic of China
went through the worst inflation 1948‚Äì49. In 1947, the highest denomination
was 50,000 yuan. By mid-1948, the highest denomination was 180,000,000 yuan.
The 1948 currency reform replaced the yuan by the gold yuan at an exchange rate
of 1 gold yuan = 3,000,000 yuan. In less than a year, the highest denomination
was 10,000,000 gold yuan. In the final days of the civil war, the Silver Yuan
was briefly introduced at the rate of 500,000,000 Gold Yuan. Meanwhile the
highest denomination issued by a regional bank was 6,000,000,000 yuan (issued
by Xinjiang Provincial Bank in 1949). After the renminbi was instituted by the
new communist government, hyperinflation ceased with a revaluation of 1:10,000
old Renminbi in 1955. The overall impact of inflation was 1 Renminbi =
15,000,000,000,000,000,000 pre-1948 yuan. Estonia. Estonia experienced
hyperinflation as a result of using the Russian ruble after the fall of the
Soviet Union. However, it was the first post-Soviet union country to implement
a currency reform by installing a currency board. It began circulation of the
Estonian kroon in April 1992, ridding the country of high inflation. France.
During the French Revolution, the National Assembly issued bonds backed by
seized church property called Assignats. These evolved into fiat legal tender
money, were overprinted and caused hyperinflation. Napoleon replaced them with
the franc in 1803, at which time the assignats were basically worthless Despite
the fact that the assignat is normally considered to be the currency of this
time, it was actually the mandat the experienced the peak month of
hyperinflation. Free City of Danzig. Danzig went through its worst inflation in
1923. In 1922, the highest denomination was 1,000 Mark. By 1923, the highest
denomination was 10,000,000,000 Mark. Georgia. Georgia went through its worst
inflation in 1994. In 1993, the highest denomination was 100,000 coupons . By
1994, the highest denomination was 1,000,000 coupons. In the 1995 currency
reform, a new currency, the lari, was introduced with 1 lari exchanged for
1,000,000 coupons. Germany. Germany went through its worst inflation in 1923.
In 1922, the highest denomination was 50,000 Mark. By 1923, the highest
denomination was 100,000,000,000,000 Mark. In December 1923 the exchange rate
was 4,200,000,000,000 Marks to 1 US dollar. In 1923, the rate of inflation hit
3.25 √ó 106 percent per month (prices double every two days). Beginning on 20
November 1923, 1,000,000,000,000 old Marks were exchanged for 1 Rentenmark so
that 4.2 Rentenmarks were worth 1 US dollar, exactly the same rate the Mark had
in 1914. Greece. Greece went through its worst inflation in 1944. In 1942, the
highest denomination was 50,000 drachmai. By 1944, the highest denomination was
100,000,000,000 drachmai. In the 1944 currency reform, 1 new drachma was
exchanged for 50,000,000,000 drachmai. Another currency reform in 1953 replaced
the drachma at an exchange rate of 1 new drachma = 1,000 old drachmai. The
overall impact of hyperinflation: 1 (1953) drachma = 50,000,000,000,000 pre
1944 drachmai. The Greek monthly inflation rate reached 8.5 billion percent in
October 1944. Hungary, 1923‚Äì24. The Treaty of Trianon and political
instability between 1919 and 1924 led to a major inflation of Hungary‚Äôs
currency. Unable to tax adequately, the government resorted to printing money
and by 1923 inflation in Hungary had reached 98% per month. Hungary, 1945‚Äì46.
Hungary went through the worst inflation ever recorded between the end of 1945
and July 1946. In 1944, the highest denomination was 1,000 peng≈ë. By the end
of 1945, it was 10,000,000 peng≈ë. The highest denomination in mid-1946 was
100,000,000,000,000,000,000 peng≈ë. A special currency the ad√≥peng≈ë ‚Äì or
tax peng≈ë ‚Äì was created for tax and postal payments. The value of the
ad√≥peng≈ë was adjusted each day, by radio announcement. On 1 January 1946 one
ad√≥peng≈ë equaled one peng≈ë. By late July, one ad√≥peng≈ë equaled
2,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 or 2√ó1021 peng≈ë. When the peng≈ë was replaced
in August 1946 by the forint, the total value of all Hungarian banknotes in
circulation amounted to 1/1,000 of one US dollar. It is the most severe known
incident of inflation recorded, peaking at 1.3 √ó 1016 percent per month
(prices double every 15 hours). The overall impact of hyperinflation: On 18
August 1946, 400,000 or 4 (four hundred quadrilliard on the long scale used in
Hungary; four hundred octillion on short scale) peng≈ë became 1 forint.
Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan experienced two episodes of hyperinflation. The first
was in 1992. A feature that most post-Soviet Union countries experienced. The
second episode was in November 1993 with the implementation of the Kazakhstani
tenge. Kyrgyzstan. Kyrgyzstan experienced hyperinflation in Jan. 1992 following
the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Krajina. The Republic of Serbian Krajina
went through its worst inflation in 1993. In 1992, the highest denomination was
50,000 dinara. By 1993, the highest denomination was 50,000,000,000 dinara.
Note that this unrecognized country was reincorporated into Croatia in 1995.
North Korea. North Korea most likely experienced hyperinflation from December
2009 to mid-January 2011. Based on the price of rice, North Korea's
hyperinflation peaked in mid-January 2010, but according to black market
exchange-rate data, and calculations base on purchasing power parity, North
Korea experienced its peak month of inflation in early March 2010. However,
this data is unofficial and therefore must be treated with a degree of caution.
Nicaragua. Nicaragua went through the worst inflation from 1986 to 1990. From
1943 to April 1971, one US dollar equalled 7 c√≥rdobas. From April 1971-early
1978, one US dollar was worth 10 c√≥rdobas. In early 1986, the highest
denomination was 10,000 c√≥rdobas. By 1987, it was 1,000,000 c√≥rdobas. In the
1988 currency reform, 1 new c√≥rdoba was exchanged for 10,000 old c√≥rdobas.
The highest denomination in 1990 was 100,000,000 new c√≥rdobas. In the 1991
currency reform, 1 new c√≥rdoba was exchanged for 5,000,000 old c√≥rdobas. The
overall impact of hyperinflation: 1 (1991) c√≥rdoba = 50,000,000,000 pre-1988
c√≥rdobas. Peru. Peru experienced its worst inflation from 1988‚Äì1990. In the
1985 currency reform, 1 inti was exchanged for 1,000 soles. In 1986, the
highest denomination was 1,000 intis. But in September 1988, monthly inflation
went to 114%. In August 1990, monthly inflation was 397%. The highest
denomination was 5,000,000 intis by 1991. In the 1991 currency reform, 1 nuevo
sol was exchanged for 1,000,000 intis. The overall impact of hyperinflation: 1
nuevo sol = 1,000,000,000 (old) soles. Philippines. The Japanese government
occupying the Philippines during the World War II issued fiat currencies for
general circulation. The Japanese-sponsored Second Philippine Republic
government led by Jose P. Laurel at the same time outlawed possession of other
currencies, most especially "guerilla money." The fiat money was dubbed "Mickey
Mouse Money" because it is similar to play money and is next to worthless.
Survivors of the war often tell tales of bringing suitcase or "bayong" (native
bags made of woven coconut or buri leaf strips) overflowing with Japanese-
issued bills. In the early times, 75 Mickey Mouse pesos could buy one duck egg.
In 1944, a box of matches cost more than 100 Mickey Mouse pesos. In 1942, the
highest denomination available was 10 pesos. Before the end of the war, because
of inflation, the Japanese government was forced to issue 100, 500 and 1000
peso notes. Poland, 1923‚Äì1924. After Poland‚Äôs independence in 1918, the
country soon began experiencing extreme inflation. By 1921, prices had already
risen 251 times above those of 1914, but in the following three years they rose
by 988,223% with a peak rate in late 1923 of prices doubling every nineteen and
a half days. At independence there was 8 marek per US dollar, but by 1923 the
exchange rate was 6,375,000 marek (mkp) for 1 US dollar. The highest
denomination was 10,000,000 mkp. In the 1924 currency reform there was a new
currency introduced: 1 zloty = 1,800,000 mkp. Poland, 1989‚Äì1990. Poland
experienced a second hyperinflation between 1989 and 1990. The highest
denomination in 1989 was 200,000 zlotych. It was 1,000,000 zlotych in 1991 and
2,000,000 zlotych in 1992; the exchange rate was 9500 zlotych for 1 US dollar
in January 1990 and 19600 zlotych at the end of August 1992. In the 1994
currency reform, 1 new zloty was exchanged for 10,000 old zlotych and 1 US$
exchange rate was ca. 2.5 zlotych (new). Republika Srpska. Republika Srpska was
a breakaway region of Bosnia. As with Krajina, it pegged its currency, the
Republika Srpska dinar, to that of Yugoslavia. Their bills were almost the same
as Krajina's, but they issued fewer and did not issue currency after 1993.
Soviet Union / Russian Federation. Between 1921 and 1922, inflation in the
Soviet Union reached 213%. In 1992, the first year of the post-Soviet economic
reform, inflation levels went up to 2,520%. In 1993, the annual rate was 840%,
and in 1994, 224%. The ruble devalued from about 40 r/$ in 1991 to about 5,000
r/$ in late 1997. In 1998, a denominated ruble was introduced at the exchange
rate of 1 new ruble = 1,000 pre-1998 rubles. In the second half of the same
year, ruble fell to about 30 r/$ as a result of financial crisis. Taiwan. As
the Chinese Civil War reached its peak, Taiwan also suffered from the
hyperinflation that has ravaged China in late 1940s. Highest denomination
issued was a 1,000,000 Dollar Bearer's Cheque. Inflation was finally brought
under control at introduction of New Taiwan Dollar in 15 June 1949 at rate of
40,000 old Dollar = 1 New Dollar Takjikistan. Takjikistan experienced two
episodes of hyperinflation. One episode following the break-up of the Soviet
Union that lasted longer than many of its neighboring countries. The second
episode was in 1995 following the circulation of their new ruble. Turkmenistan.
Turkmenistan experience two episodes of hyperinflation as well. Similar to
Takjikistan it experienced one episode in 1992 and one in 1995 following the
introduction of its currency the manat. Ukraine. Ukraine experienced its worst
inflation between 1992 and 1994. In 1992, the Ukrainian karbovanets was
introduced, which was exchanged with the defunct Soviet ruble at a rate of 1
UAK = 1 SUR. Before 1993, the highest denomination was 1,000 karbovantsiv. By
1995, it was 1,000,000 karbovantsiv. In 1996, during the transition to the
Hryvnya and the subsequent phase out of the karbovanets, the exchange rate was
100,000 UAK = 1 UAH. By some estimates, inflation for the entire calendar year
of 1993 was 10,000% or higher, with retail prices reaching over 100 times their
pre-1993 level by the end of the year. In 1996, it was taken out of
circulation, and was replaced by the Hryvnya at an exchange rate of 100,000
karbovantsi = 1 Hryvnya (approx. USD 0.50 at that time, about USD 0.20 as of
2007). Uzbekistan. Like many of the post-Soviet Union countries, Uzbekistan
also experienced hyperinflation following the dissolution of the Soviet Union
in 1992. Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia went through a period of hyperinflation and
subsequent currency reforms from 1989‚Äì1994. The highest denomination in 1988
was 50,000 dinars. By 1989 it was 2,000,000 dinars. In the 1990 currency
reform, 1 new dinar was exchanged for 10,000 old dinars. In the 1992 currency
reform, 1 new dinar was exchanged for 10 old dinars. The highest denomination
in 1992 was 50,000 dinars. By 1993, it was 10,000,000,000 dinars. In the 1993
currency reform, 1 new dinar was exchanged for 1,000,000 old dinars. However,
before the year was over, the highest denomination was 500,000,000,000 dinars.
In the 1994 currency reform, 1 new dinar was exchanged for 1,000,000,000 old
dinars. In another currency reform a month later, 1 novi dinar was exchanged
for 13 million dinars (1 novi dinar = 1 German mark at the time of exchange).
The overall impact of hyperinflation: 1 novi dinar = 1 √ó 1027~1.3 √ó 1027 pre
1990 dinars. Yugoslavia's rate of inflation hit 5 √ó 1015 percent cumulative
inflation over the time period 1 October 1993 and 24 January 1994. Zaire (now
the Democratic Republic of the Congo). Zaire went through a period of inflation
between 1989 and 1996. In 1988, the highest denomination was 5,000 zaires. By
1992, it was 5,000,000 zaires. In the 1993 currency reform, 1 nouveau zaire was
exchanged for 3,000,000 old zaires. The highest denomination in 1996 was
1,000,000 nouveaux zaires. In 1997, Zaire was renamed the Congo Democratic
Republic and changed its currency to francs. 1 franc was exchanged for 100,000
nouveaux zaires. One post-1997 franc was equivalent to 3 √ó 1011 pre 1989
zaires. Zimbabwe. Hyperinflation in Zimbabwe was one of the few instances that
resulted in the abandonment of the local currency. At independence in 1980, the
Zimbabwe dollar (ZWD) was worth about USD 1.25. Afterwards, however, rampant
inflation and the collapse of the economy severely devalued the currency.
Inflation was steady before Robert Mugabe in 1998 began a program of land
reforms that primarily focused on taking land from white farmers and
redistributing those properties and assets to black farmers, which sent food
production and revenues from export of food plummeting. The result was that to
pay its expenditures Mugabe‚Äôs government and Gideon Gono‚Äôs Reserve Bank
printed more and more notes with higher face values. Inflation by 16 July
officially surged to 2,200,000% with some analysts estimating figures
surpassing 9,000,000 percent. As of 22 July 2008 the value of the ZWN fell to
approximately 688 billion per 1 USD, or 688 trillion pre-August 2006 Zimbabwean
dollars. On 1 August 2008, the Zimbabwe dollar was redenominated at the ratio
of ZWN to each third dollar (ZWR). On 19 August 2008, official figures
announced for June estimated the inflation over 11,250,000%. Zimbabwe's annual
inflation was 231,000,000% in July (prices doubling every 17.3 days). For
periods after July 2008, no official inflation statistics were released. Prof.
Steve H. Hanke overcame the problem by estimating inflation rates after July
2008 and publishing the Hanke Hyperinflation Index for Zimbabwe. Prof.
Hanke‚Äôs HHIZ measure indicated that the inflation peaked at an annual rate of
89.7 sextillion percent (89,700,000,000,000,000,000,000%) in mid-November 2008.
The peak monthly rate was 79.6 billion percent, which is equivalent to a 98%
daily rate, or around percent yearly rate. At that rate, prices were doubling
every 24.7 hours. Note that many of these figures should be considered mostly
theoretic, since the hyperinflation did not proceed at that rate a whole year.
At its November 2008 peak, Zimbabwe's rate of inflation approached, but failed
to surpass, Hungary's July 1946 world record. On 2 February 2009, the dollar
was redenominated for the fourth time at the ratio of ZWR to 1 ZWL, only three
weeks after the $100 trillion banknote was issued on 16 January, but
hyperinflation waned by then as official inflation rates in USD were announced
and foreign transactions were legalised, and on 12 April the dollar was
abandoned in favour of using only foreign currencies. The overall impact of
hyperinflation was 1 ZWL = ZWD. Examples of high inflation. Some countries
experienced very high inflation, but did not reach hyperinflation, as defined
as a "monthly" inflation rate of 50%. Iraq. Between 1987 and 1995 the Iraqi
Dinar went from an official value of 0.306 Dinars/USD (or $3.26 USD per dinar,
though the black market rate is thought to have been substantially lower) to
3000 Dinars/USD due to government printing of 10s of trillions of dinars
starting with a base of only 10s of billions. That equates to approximately
315% inflation per year averaged over that eight year period. Mexico. In spite
of the Oil Crisis of the late 1970s (Mexico is a producer and exporter), and
due to excessive social spending, Mexico defaulted on its external debt in
1982. As a result, the country suffered a severe case of capital flight and
several years of hyperinflation and peso devaluation. On 1 January 1993, Mexico
created a new currency, the nuevo peso ("new peso", or MXN), which chopped 3
zeros off the old peso, an inflation rate of 10,000% over the several years of
the crisis. (One new peso was equal to 1000 of the obsolete MXP pesos). Roman
Egypt. In Roman Egypt, where the best documentation on pricing has survived, a
measure of wheat which sold for 200 drachmae in 276 AD increased to more than
2,000,000 drachmae in 334 AD, roughly 1,000,000% inflation in a span of 58-
years. Although the price increased by a factor of 10,000 over 58 years, the
annual rate of inflation was only 17.2% compounded. This can be shown by the
sum: R = (1 + 0.172)^58. Inflation but not hyperinflation. Romania. Romania
experienced hyperinflation in the 1990s. The highest denomination in 1990 was
100 lei and in 1998 was 100,000 lei. By 2000 it was 500,000 lei. In early 2005
it was 1,000,000 lei. In July 2005 the leu was replaced by the new leu at
10,000 old lei = 1 new leu. Inflation in 2005 was 9%. In July 2005 the highest
denomination became 500 lei (= 5,000,000 old lei). United States. During the
Revolutionary War, when the Continental Congress authorized the printing of
paper currency called continental currency, the monthly inflation rate reached
a peak of 47 percent in November 1779 (Bernholz 2003: 48). These notes
depreciated rapidly, giving rise to the expression "not worth a continental." A
second close encounter occurred during the U.S. Civil War, between January 1861
and April 1865, the Lerner Commodity Price Index of leading cities in the
eastern Confederacy states increased from 100 to over 9,000. As the Civil War
dragged on, the Confederate dollar had less and less value, until it was almost
worthless by the last few months of the war. Similarly, the Union government
inflated its greenbacks, with the monthly rate peaking at 40 percent in March
1864 (Bernholz 2003: 107). Units of inflation. Inflation rate is usually
measured in percent per year. It can also be measured in percent per month or
in price doubling time. formula_1 formula_2 formula_3 formula_4 Often, at
redenominations, three zeroes are cut from the bills. It can be read from the
table that if the (annual) inflation is for example 100%, it takes 3.32 years
to produce one more zero on the price tags, or 3 √ó 3.32 = 9.96 years to
produce three zeroes. Thus can one expect a redenomination to take place about
9.96 years after the currency was introduced.
