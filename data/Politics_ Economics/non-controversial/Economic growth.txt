Economic growth Economic growth is the increase in the amount of the goods and
services produced by an economy over time. It is conventionally measured as the
percent rate of increase in "real gross domestic product", or "real GDP".
Growth is usually calculated in "real" terms, i.e. inflation-adjusted terms, in
order to obviate the distorting effect of inflation on the price of the goods
and services produced. In economics, "economic growth" or "economic growth
theory" typically refers to growth of potential output, i.e., production at
"full employment," which is caused by growth in aggregate demand or observed
output. As an area of study, "economic growth" is generally distinguished from
"development economics". The former is primarily the study of how countries can
advance their economies. The latter is the study of the economic aspects of the
development process in low-income countries. As economic growth is measured as
the annual percent change of gross domestic product (GDP), it has all the
advantages and drawbacks of that measure. Definitions and history. Economic
growth versus the business cycle. Economists distinguish between short-run
economic changes in production and long-run economic growth. Short-run
variation in economic growth is termed the "business cycle". Briefly, the
business cycle is made up of booms and busts in production that occur over a
period of months or years. The most recent example of a business cycle was the
global boom starting in approximately 2002 that ended with the Late-2000s
recession. As discussed in the article on the business cycle, economists
attribute the ups and downs in the business cycle to a number of causes
including: overproduction of goods followed by large inventories that cannot be
readily sold, overexpansion of credit resulting in piling up of debt that
inhibits purchasing; speculative bubbles, and shocksâ€”like wars, political
upheavals, and so on. In contrast, the topic of economic growth is concerned
with the long-run trend in production due to basic causes such as
industrialization. The business cycle moves up and down, creating fluctuations
in the long-run trend in economic growth. Historical sources of economic
growth. Economic growth has traditionally been attributed to increases in
population, accumulation of capital, and increased productivity. Increases in
productivity are a major factor responsible for per capita economic growth,
especially since the mid-19th century. Most of the economic growth in the 20th
century was due to reduced inputs of labor, materials, energy, and land per
unit of economic output (less input per widget). The balance of growth has come
from using more inputs overall because of the growth in output (more widgets or
alternately more value added), including new kinds of goods and services
(innovations). Opening up new territories was considered a growth factor in the
past, not being important since the late 19th century, except in a few areas
areas such as Latin America, where forests were cleared in the 20th century for
agriculture and in sub-Saharan Africa. During colonial times, what ultimately
mattered for economic growth were the institutions and systems of government
imported through colonization. There is a clear reversal of fortune between the
poor and wealthy countries, which is evident when comparing the method of
colonialism in a region. Geography and endowments of natural resources are not
the sole determinants of GDP. In fact, those that were blessed with good factor
endowments experienced colonial extraction which only provided limited rapid
growth; whereas, countries that were less fortunate in their original
endowments experienced European settlement, relative equality, and demand for
rule of law. These initially poor colonies end up developing an open franchise,
equality, and broad public education, which helps them experience greater
economic growth than the colonies that had exploited their economies of scale.
During the Industrial Revolution, mechanization began to replace hand methods
in manufacturing and new processes were developed to make chemicals, iron,
steel and other products. Machine tools made possible the economical production
of metal parts to precise tolerances so that parts could be interchangeable.
See: [parts. During the Second Industrial Revolution, a major factor of
productivity was the substitution of energy from, human and animal labor, water
and wind power to electrification and internal combustion. Since that
replacement, the great expansion of total power was driven by continuous
improvements in energy conversion efficiency. Other major historical sources of
productivity were automation, transportation infrastructures (canals,
railroads, and highways), new materials (steel) and power, which includes steam
and internal combustion engines and electricity. Other productivity
improvements included mechanized agriculture and scientific agriculture
including chemical fertilizers and livestock and poultry management, and the
Green Revolution. Interchangeable parts made with machine tools powered by
electric motors evolved into mass production, which is universally used today.
Great sources of productivity improvement in the late 19th century were the
railroads, steam ships, horse-pulled reapers and combine harvesters, and steam-
powered factories. The invention of processes for making cheap steel were
important for many forms of mechanization and transportation. By the late 19th
century, power and machinery were creating overproduction, which eventually
caused a reduction of the hourly work week. Prices fell because less labor,
materials, and energy were required to produce and transport goods; however,
workers real pay rose, allowing workers to improve their diet and buy consumer
goods and better housing. Mass production of the 1920s created overproduction,
which was arguably one of several causes of the Great Depression of the 1930s.
Following the Great Depression, economic growth resumed, aided in part by
demand for entirely new goods and services, such as telephones, radio,
television, automobiles, and household appliances, air conditioning, and
commercial aviation (after 1950), creating enough new demand to stabilize the
work week. Building of highway infrastructures also contributed to post World
War II growth, as did capital investments in manufacturing and chemical
industries. The post World War II economy also benefited from the discovery of
vast amounts of oil around the world, particularly in the Middle East. Economic
growth in Western nations slowed after 1973, but growth in Asia has been strong
since then, starting with Japan and spreading to Korea, China, the Indian
subcontinent and other parts of Asia. In 1957 South Korea had a lower per
capita GDP than Ghana, and by 2008 it was 17 times as high as Ghana's. The
Japanese economic growth has slowed down considerably since late 1980s.
Economic growth per capita. Often, the concern about economic growth focuses on
the desire to improve a country's standard of livingâ€”the level of goods and
services that, on average, individuals purchase or otherwise gain access to. It
should be noted that if population has grown along with economic production,
increases in GDP do not necessarily result in an improvement in the standard of
living. When the focus is on standard of living, economic growth is expressed
on a per capita basis. Economic growth per capita is primarily driven by
improvements in productivity, also called economic efficiency. Increased
productivity means producing more goods and services with the same inputs of
labour, capital, energy, and/or materials. For example, labour and land
productivity in agriculture were increased during the Green Revolution. The
Green Revolution of the 1940s to 1970s introduced new grain hybrids, which
increased yields around the world. However, there is not necessarily a long
term one-to-one relationship between improvements in productivity and
improvements in average standard of living. Among other factors that might
prevent a long-term improvement in standard of living despite economic growth
is the potential for population growth matching or outstripping productivity
improvements. When increased food supplies spur population growth rather than
an improvement in the standard of living, people are said to be caught in the
"Malthusian trap," named for Thomas Robert Malthus, the first observer to
detail out this dilemma. There is considerable controversy, for example, as to
whether the Green Revolution resulted in long-term improvements in the standard
of living as it was accompanied by rapid population growth creating population
sizes that may be unsustainable. A high savings rate is also linked to the
standard of living. Higher saving will in the long run lead to a permanently
higher output (income) per capita as capital accumulation per individual also
increases. Economic growth can also be of interest without reference to per
capita changes in standard of living. An example of this is the economic growth
in England during the Industrial Revolution. Certainly, per capita increases in
productivity occurred due to the replacement of hand labour by machines.
However, economic growth during this period was in large part so dramatic
because England's population simultaneously increased very rapidly (1700 â€“
1860). The two factors together, more production per worker combined with many
more workers, resulted in a sixfold increase in production between 1700 and
1860. Population growth alone accounted for most of this increase. Measuring
economic growth. Economic growth is measured as a percentage change in the
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) or Gross National Product (GNP). These two
measures, which are calculated slightly differently, total the amounts paid for
the goods and services that a country produced. As an example of measuring
economic growth, a country which creates $9,000,000,000 in goods and services
in 2010 and then creates $9,090,000,000 in 2011, has a nominal economic growth
rate of 1% for 2011. In order to compare per capita economic growth among
countries, the total sales of the countries to be compared may be quoted in a
single currency. This requires converting the value of currencies of various
countries into a selected currency, for example U.S. dollars. One way to do
this conversion is to rely on exchange rates among the currencies, for example
how many Mexican pesos buy a single U.S. dollar? Another approach is to use the
purchasing power parity method. This method is based on how much consumers must
pay for the same "basket of goods" in each country. Inflation or deflation can
make it difficult to measure economic growth. If GDP, for example, goes up in a
country by 1% in a year, was this due solely to rising prices (inflation) or
because more goods and services were produced and saved? To express real growth
rather than changes in prices for the same goods, statistics on economic growth
are often adjusted for inflation or deflation. For example, a table may show
changes in GDP in the period 1990 to 2000, as expressed in 1990 U.S. dollars.
This means that the single currency being used is the U.S. dollar with the
purchasing power it had in the U.S. in 1990. The table might mention that the
figures are "inflation-adjusted" or real. If no adjustment were made for
inflation, the table might make no mention of inflation-adjustment or might
mention that the prices are nominal. The power of annual growth. Over long
periods of time, even small rates of growth, like a 2% annual increase, will
have large effects. For example, the United Kingdom experienced a 1.97% average
annual increase in inflation-adjusted GDP between 1830 and 2008. In 1830, the
GDP was 41,373 million pounds. It grew to 1,330,088 million pounds by 2008.
(Figures are adjusted for inflation and stated in 2005 values for the pound.) A
growth rate which averaged 1.97% over 178 years resulted in a 32-fold increase
in GDP by 2008. The large impact of a relatively small growth rate over a long
period of time is due to the power of compounding (also see exponential
growth). A growth rate of 2.5% per annum leads to a doubling of GDP within 29
years, whilst a growth rate of 8% per annum (an average exceeded by China
between 2000 and 2010) leads to a doubling of GDP within 10 years. Thus, a
small difference in economic growth rates between countries can result in very
different standards of living for their populations if this small difference
continues for many years. Theories of economic growth. Classical growth theory.
The modern conception of economic growth began with the critique of
Mercantilism, especially by the physiocrats and with the Scottish Enlightenment
thinkers such as David Hume and Adam Smith, and the foundation of the
discipline of modern political economy. David Ricardo argued that trade was a
benefit to a country, because if one could buy a good more cheaply from abroad,
it meant that there was more profitable work to be done here. This theory of
"comparative advantage" would be the central basis for arguments in favor of
free trade as an essential component of growth. The neoclassical growth model.
The notion of growth as increased stocks of capital goods (means of production)
was codified as the Solow-Swan Growth Model, which involved a series of
equations which showed the relationship between labor-time, capital goods,
output, and investment. According to this view, the role of technological
change became crucial, even more important than the accumulation of capital.
This model, developed by Robert Solow and Trevor Swan in the 1950s, was the
first attempt to model long-run growth analytically. This model assumes that
countries use their resources efficiently and that there are diminishing
returns to capital and labor increases. From these two premises, the
neoclassical model makes three important predictions. First, increasing capital
relative to labor creates economic growth, since people can be more productive
given more capital. Second, poor countries with less capital per person will
grow faster because each investment in capital will produce a higher return
than rich countries with ample capital. Third, because of diminishing returns
to capital, economies will eventually reach a point at which any increase in
capital will no longer create economic growth. This point is called a "steady
state". The model also notes that countries can overcome this steady state and
continue growing by inventing new technology. In the long run, output per
capital depends on the rate of saving, but the rate of output growth should be
equal for any saving rate. In this model, the process by which countries
continue growing despite the diminishing returns is "exogenous" and represents
the creation of new technology that allows production with fewer resources.
Technology improves, the steady state level of capital increases, and the
country invests and grows. The data does not support some of this model's
predictions, in particular, that all countries grow at the same rate in the
long run, or that poorer countries should grow faster until they reach their
steady state. Also, the data suggests the world has slowly increased its rate
of growth. However, modern economic research shows that the baseline version of
the neoclassical model of economic growth is not supported by the evidence.
Salter cycle. According to the Salter cycle, economic growth is enabled by
increases in productivity, which lowers the inputs (labour, capital, material,
energy, etc.) for a given amount of product (output). Lowered cost increases
demand for goods and services, which also results in capital investment to
increase capacity. New capacity is more efficient because of new technology,
improved methods and economies of scale. This leads to further price
reductions, which further increases demand, until markets become saturated due
to diminishing marginal utility. Endogenous growth theory. Growth theory
advanced again with theories of economist Paul Romer and Robert Lucas, Jr. in
the late 1980s and early 1990s. Unsatisfied with Solow's explanation,
economists worked to "endogenize" technology in the 1980s. They developed the
endogenous growth theory that includes a mathematical explanation of
technological advancement. This model also incorporated a new concept of human
capital, the skills and knowledge that make workers productive. Unlike physical
capital, human capital has increasing rates of return. Therefore, overall there
are constant returns to capital, and economies never reach a steady state.
Growth does not slow as capital accumulates, but the rate of growth depends on
the types of capital a country invests in. Research done in this area has
focused on what increases human capital (e.g. education) or technological
change (e.g. innovation). John Joseph Puthenkalam's research aims at the
process of economic growth theories that lead to economic development. After
analyzing the existing capitalistic growth-development theoretical apparatus,
he introduces the new model which integrates the variables of freedom,
democracy and human rights into the existing models and argue that any future
economic growth-development of any nation depends on this emerging model as we
witness the third wave of unfolding demand for democracy in the Middle East. He
develops the knowledge sector in growth theories with two new concepts of
'micro knowledge' and 'macro knowledge'. Micro knowledge is what an individual
learns from school or from various existing knowledge and macro knowledge is
the core philosophical thinking of a nation that all individuals inherently
receive. How to combine both these knowledge would determine further growth
that leads to economic development of developing nations. For further reading,
please refer to "Integrating Freedom, Democracy and Human Rights into Theories
of Economic Growth" (1998,2000&2009). Energy and energy efficiency theories.
The importance of energy to economic growth was emphasized by William Stanley
Jevons in "The Coal Question" in which he described the rebound effect based on
the observation that increasing energy efficiency resulted in more use of
energy. (See: Jevons paradox) In the 1980s, the economists Daniel Khazzoom and
Leonard Brookes independently put forward ideas about energy consumption and
behavior that argue that increased energy efficiency paradoxically tends to
lead to increased energy consumption. In 1992, the US economist Harry Saunders
dubbed this hypothesis the "Khazzoomâ€“Brookes postulate", and showed that it
was true under neo-classical growth theory over a wide range of assumptions.
Ayres and Warr have presented a model that aims to address deficiencies in the
neo-classical and endogenous growth models. It claims that physical and
chemical work performed by energy, or more correctly exergy, has historically
been a very important driver of economic growth. Key support for this theory is
a mathematical model showing that the efficiency of a composite indicator using
electrical generation and other energy efficiencies is a good proxy for the
Solow residual, or technological progress, that is, the portion of economic
growth that is not attributable to capital or labor. Energy growth theory
economists have criticized orthodox economics for neglecting the role of energy
and natural resources. Ayres and Warr's model relates the slowing of economic
growth to energy conversion efficiencies approaching thermodynamic limits, and
cautions that declining resource quality could bring an end to economic growth
in a few decades. Hall et al. 2001 state: "Although the first and second laws
of thermodynamics are the most thoroughly tested and validated laws of nature
[..] the basic neoclassical economic model is a perpetual motion machine, with
no required inputs or limits." Theory of cognitive wealth (cognitive
capitalism). The theory of "Cognitive capitalism" asserts that cognitive
ability is the crucial factor which creates wealth in modern economies, and
that the geographical factors which have been necessary in ancient societies
are no longer so important. The average cognitive ability of a nation
determines its wealth, each IQ point increase boosting a country's average GDP
by $229. Of even more significance, the IQ of the brightest 5% of people in the
nation (the cognitive elite) boosts GDP by $468 per IQ point. The cognitive
elite support general efficiency, technological innovation, efficient
administration, independent institutions, and economic freedom. Via these
factors intelligence and knowledge stimulate growth leading to national wealth,
which in turn may boost cognitive ability in a virtuous circle. The theory was
developed by the two psychologists Heiner Rindermann and James Thompson. The
theory is related to human capital theory. Unified growth theory. Unified
growth theory was developed by Oded Galor and his co-authors to address the
inability of endogenous growth theory to explain key empirical regularities in
the growth processes of individual economies and the world economy as a whole.
Endogenous growth theory was satisfied with accounting for empirical
regularities in the growth process of developed economies over the last hundred
years. As a consequence, it was not able to explain the qualitatively different
empirical regularities that characterized the growth process over longer time
horizons in both developed and less developed economies. Unified growth
theories are endogenous growth theories that are consistent with the entire
process of development, and in particular the transition from the epoch of
Malthusian stagnation that had characterized most of the process of development
to the contemporary era of sustained economic growth. The big push. In theories
of economic growth, the mechanisms that let it take place and its main
determinants are abundant. One popular theory in the 1940s, for example, was
that of the "Big Push" which suggested that countries needed to jump from one
stage of development to another through a virtuous cycle, in which large
investments in infrastructure and education coupled with private investments
would move the economy to a more productive stage, breaking free from economic
paradigms appropriate to a lower productivity stage. Schumpeterian Growth.
Schumpeterian growth is an economic theory named after the 20th century
Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter. Unlike other economic growth theories,
his approach explains growth by innovation as a process of creative
destruction, which captures the dual nature of technological progress: in terms
of creation, entrepreneurs introduce new products or processes in the hope that
they will enjoy temporary monopoly-like profits as they capture markets. In
doing so, they make old technologies or products obsolete: this is the
destruction referred to by Schumpeter, that could also be referred to as the
annulment of previous technologies which makes them obsolete, and "which
destroys the rents generated by previous innovations" (Aghion 855).Â Â  â€¢
Also see Wendy Carlin and David Soskice, 2006, "Macroeconomics: Imperfections,
Institutions & Policies", specifically chapter 14. A major model that
illustrates Schumpeterian growth is the Aghion-Howitt model.Â Â  â€¢ Philippe
Aghion, 2002, "Schumpeterian Growth Theory and the Dynamics of Income
Inequality", Econometrica, 70(3), 855â€“882. Institutions and growth. According
to AcemoÄŸlu, Simon Johnson and James Robinson, the positive correlation
between high income and cold climate is a by-product of history. Europeans
adopted very different colonization policies in different colonies, with
different associated institutions. In places where these colonizers faced high
mortality rates (e.g., due to the presence of tropical diseases), they could
not settle permanently, and they were thus more likely to establish extractive
institutions, which persisted after independence; in places where they could
settle permanently (e.g. those with temperate climates), they established
institutions with this objective in mind and modeled them after those in their
European homelands. In these 'neo-Europes' better institutions in turn produced
better development outcomes. Thus, although other economists focus on the
identity or type of legal system of the colonizers to explain institutions,
these authors look at the environmental conditions in the colonies to explain
institutions. For instance, former colonies have inherited corrupt governments
and geo-political boundaries (set by the colonizers) that are not properly
placed regarding the geographical locations of different ethnic groups,
creating internal disputes and conflicts which in turn hinder development. In
another example, societies that emerged in colonies without solid native
populations established better property rights and incentives for long-term
investment than those where native populations were large. Human capital and
growth. One ubiquitous element of both theoretical and empirical analyses of
economic growth is the role of human capital. The skills of the population
enter into both neoclassical and endogenous growth models.Â Â  â€¢ Sala-i-

LudRomer, Paul. 1990. "Human capital and growth: Theory and evidence."
Carnegie-Rochester Conference Series on Public Policy 32: 251â€“286. The most
commonly used measure of human capital is the level of school attainment in a
country, building upon the data development of Robert Barro and Jong-Wha Lee.
This measure of human capital, however, requires the strong assumption that
what is learned in a year of schooling is the same across all countries. It
also presumes that human capital is only developed in formal schooling,
contrary to the extensive evidence that families, neighborhoods, peers, and
health also contribute to the development of human capital. In order to measure
human capital more accurately, Eric Hanushek and Dennis Kimko introduced
measures of mathematics and science skills from international assessments into
growth analysis. Inequality and economic growth. Initial theories incorrectly
stated that inequality had a positive effect on economic development. The
marginal propensity to save was thought to increas with wealth and inequality
increases savings and capital accumulation. However, it was determined much
later that the analysis based on comparing yearly equality figures to yearly
growth rates was flawed and misleading because it takes several years for the
effects of equality changes to manifest in economic growth changes. The credit
market imperfection approach, developed by Galor and Zeira (1993), demonstrates
that inequality in the presence of credit market imperfections has a long
lasting detrimental effect on human capital formation and economic development.
The political economy approach, developed by Alesian and Rodrik (1994) and
Persson and Tabellini (1994), argues that inequality is harmful for economic
development because inequality generates a pressure to adopt redistributive
policies that have an adverse effect on investment and economic growth.
Evidence. A study by Perotti (1996) examines of the channels through which
inequality may affect economic growth. He shows that in accordance with the
credit market imperfection approach, inequality is associated with lower level
of human capital formation (education, experience, apprenticeship) and higher
level of fertility, while lower level of human capital is associated with lower
growth and lower levels of economic growth. In contrast, his examination of the
political economy channel refutes the political economy mechanism. He
demonstrates that inequality is associated with lower levels of taxation, while
lower levels of taxation, contrary to the theories, are associated with lower
level of economic growth A 2011 note for the International Monetary Fund by
Andrew G. Berg and Jonathan D. Ostry found a strong association between lower
levels of inequality in developing countries and sustained periods of economic
growth. Developing countries with high inequality have "succeeded in initiating
growth at high rates for a few years" but "longer growth spells are robustly
associated with more equality in the income distribution." Disputing the claim
of a Washington Post editorialist that "Western Europeâ€™s recent history
suggests that flat income distribution accompanies flat economic growth,"
journalist Timothy Noah, points out that redistribution policies in Europe do
not seem to be correlated to economic problems of the late twenty-oughts. With
the exception of Ireland, the countries at risk of default in 2011 (Greece,
Italy, Spain, Portugal) were notable for their high Gini-measured levels of
income inequality compared to other European countries. As measured by the Gini
index, Greece as of 2008 had more income inequality than the economically
healthy Germany. Quality of life. Happiness has been shown to increase with a
higher GDP per capita, at least up to a level of $15,000 per person. Economic
growth has the indirect potential to alleviate poverty, as a result of a
simultaneous increase in employment opportunities and increase labour
productivity. A study by researchers at the Overseas Development Institute
(ODI) of 24 countries that experienced growth found that in 18 cases, poverty
was alleviated. However, employment is no guarantee of escaping poverty, the
International Labour Organisation (ILO) estimates that as many as 40% of
workers as poor, not earning enough to keep their families above the $2 a day
poverty line. For instance, in India most of the chronically poor are wage
earners in formal employment, because their jobs are insecure and low paid and
offer no chance to accumulate wealth to avoid risks. This appears to be the
result of a negative relationship between employment creation and increased
productivity, when a simultaneous positive increase is required to reduced
poverty. According to the UNRISD, increasing labour productivity appears to
have a negative impact on job creation: in the 1960s, a 1% increase in output
per worker was associated with a reduction in employment growth of 0.07%, by
the first decade of this century the same productivity increase implies reduced
employment growth by 0.54%. Increases in employment without increases in
productivity leads to a rise in the number of "working poor", which is why some
experts are now promoting the creation of "quality" and not "quantity" in
labour market policies. This approach does highlight how higher productivity
has helped reduce poverty in East Asia, but the negative impact is beginning to
show. In Vietnam, for example, employment growth has slowed while productivity
growth has continued. Furthermore, productivity increases do not always lead to
increased wages, as can be seen in the United States, where the gap between
productivity and wages has been rising since the 1980s. The ODI study showed
that other sectors were just as important in reducing unemployment, as
manufacturing. The services sector is most effective at translating
productivity growth into employment growth. Agriculture provides a safety net
for jobs and economic buffer when other sectors are struggling. This study
suggests a more nuanced understanding of economic growth and quality of life
and poverty alleviation. Opportunities, education, health, security and a
healthy environment contribute to the quality of life. Public policy plays a
great role happiness, as Petra Pinzler points out in D+C Development and
Cooperation. Negative effects of economic growth. A number of critical
arguments have been raised against economic growth. It may be that economic
growth improves the quality of life up to a point, after which it doesn't
improve the quality of life, but rather obstructs sustainable living.
Historically, sustained growth has reached its limits (and turned to
catastrophic decline) when perturbations to the environmental system last long
enough to destabilise the bases of a culture. "Limits to Growth" (1972), and
the Simonâ€“Ehrlich wager (1980) did not materialize, nor has diminished
production of most resources occurred so far, one reason being that
advancements in technology and science have allowed some previously unavailable
resources to be produced. In some cases, substitution of more abundant
materials, such as plastics for cast metals, lowered growth of usage for some
metals. In the case of the limited resource of land, famine was relieved
firstly by the revolution in transportation caused by railroads and steam
ships, and later by the Green Revolution and chemical fertilizers, especially
the Haber process for ammonia synthesis. In the case of minerals, lower grades
of mineral resources are being extracted, requiring higher inputs of capital
and energy for both extraction and processing. An example is natural gas from
shale and other low permeability rock, which can be developed with much higher
inputs of energy, capital, and materials than conventional gas in previous
decades. Another example is offshore oil and gas, which has exponentially
increasing cost as water depth increases. Some "Malthusians", such as William
R. Catton, Jr., author of the 1980 book "Overshoot," are skeptical of these
various advancements in technology which make available previously inaccessible
or lower grade resources. The counter-argument is that such advances as well as
increases in efficiency merely accelerate the drawing down of finite resources.
Catton has referred to the contemporary increases in rates of resource
extraction as "stealing ravenously from the future." The apparent and temporary
"increase" of resource extraction with the use of new technology leads to the
popular perception that resources are infinite or can be substituted without
limit, but this perception fails to consider that ultimately, even lower
quality resources are finite and become uneconomic to extract when the ore
quality is too low. Because of cultural lag, the perception of infinite
resources and substitutes may linger on for generations, and may not change,
since the inevitable resource bankruptcy is passed on to posterity. Catton has
called the faith in technology a form of "cargoism," which takes its meaning
from various "Cargo Cults" in Melanesia and Micronesia. Furthermore, Joseph
Tainter, anthropologist, historian and author of the book "The Collapse of
Complex Societies," has pointed out that each new addition of complexity to
technology can only be sustained if there is a good enough return to justify
the technology, and that over time, increases in complexity have improved
productivity at an ever decreasing rate. As an example, in the early 20th
century when much of the world's oil was untapped, it was sufficient to drill a
few metres into the ground and install inexpensive rigs to extract oil at rapid
rates. At the beginning of the 21st century, in order to achieve the same
flowrates or less, oilfields must be drilled much deeper and managed with
sophisticated techniques and equipment costing many hundreds of millions of
dollars. If such trends continue, there may arrive a time when it becomes
uneconomic to increase complexity in order to access lower grade resources with
no net improvement in productivity. Environmental impact. Some critics argue
that a narrow view of economic growth, combined with globalization, is creating
a scenario where we could see a systemic collapse of our planet's natural
resources.Â Â  â€¢ Allan Schnaiberg. The Environment: From Surpus to Scarcity.
New York: Oxford University Press. Other critics draw on archaeology to cite
examples of cultures they claim have disappeared because they grew beyond the
ability of their ecosystems to support them. Concerns about possible negative
effects of growth on the environment and society led some to advocate lower
levels of growth, from which comes the ideas of uneconomic growth and de-
growth, and Green parties which argue that economies are part of a global
society and a global ecology and cannot outstrip their natural growth without
damaging them. Those more optimistic about the environmental impacts of growth
believe that, although localized environmental effects may occur, large scale
ecological effects are minor. The argument as stated by commentators Julian
Lincoln Simon states that if these global-scale ecological effects exist, human
ingenuity will find ways of adapting to them. Equitable growth. Researchers at
the Overseas Development Institute compares situations such as in Uganda, where
during a period of annual growth of 2.5% between 2000 and 2003, the percentage
of people living in poverty actually increased by 3.8%. The ODI thus emphasises
the need to ensure social protection is extended to allow universal access and
that policies are introduced to encourage the private sector to create new jobs
as the economy grows (as opposed to jobless growth) and seek to employ people
from disadvantaged groups. Implications of global warming. Up to the present
there are close correlations of economic growth with carbon dioxide emissions
across nations, although there is also a considerable divergence in carbon
intensity (carbon emissions per GDP). The Stern Review notes that the
prediction that "under business as usual, global emissions will be sufficient
to propel greenhouse gas concentrations to over 550ppm e by 2050 and over
650â€“700ppm by the end of this century is robust to a wide range of changes in
model assumptions". The scientific consensus is that planetary ecosystem
functioning without incurring dangerous risks requires stabilization at
450â€“550 ppm. As a consequence, growth-oriented environmental economists
propose massive government intervention into switching sources of energy
production, favouring wind, solar, hydroelectric, and nuclear. This would
largely confine use of fossil fuels to either domestic cooking needs (such as
for kerosene burners) or where carbon capture and storage technology can be
cost-effective and reliable. The Stern Review, published by the United Kingdom
Government in 2006, concluded that an investment of 1% of GDP would be
sufficient to avoid the worst effects of climate change, and that failure to do
so could risk climate-related costs equal to 20% of GDP. Because carbon capture
and storage is as yet widely unproven, and its long term effectiveness (such as
in containing carbon dioxide 'leaks') unknown, and because of current costs of
alternative fuels, these policy responses largely rest on faith of
technological change. On the other hand, Nigel Lawson claimed that people in a
hundred years' time would be "seven times as well off as we are today",
therefore it is not reasonable to impose sacrifices on the "much poorer present
generation".
