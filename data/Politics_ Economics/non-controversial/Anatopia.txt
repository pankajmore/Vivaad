Anatopia Anatopia was a land squat in Papenburg, Germany. The site was squatted
July 4 1991 and evicted January 7 1995 after a long struggle. It was on a
location where the Daimler-Benz automobile company (Mercedes-Benz) intended to
build a test track (12 km long, 3 km wide) and became the focus of anti-
Mercedes protests throughout Germany. The squatters lived a vegan lifestyle,
eating communally every night.
