Geopolitics Geopolitics, from Greek ŒìŒ∑ (earth) and Œ ŒøŒªŒπœÑŒπŒ∫ŒÆ
(politics), refers broadly to the relationship between politics and territory
whether on local or international scale. It comprises the practice of
analysing, proscribing, forecasting, and the using of political power over a
given territory. Specifically, it is a method of foreign policy analysis, which
seeks to understand, explain and predict international political behaviour
primarily in terms of geographical variables. Those geographical variables
generally refer to: geographic location of the country or countries in
question, size of the countries involved, climate of the region the countries
are in, topography of the region, demography, natural resources and
technological development. Traditionally, the term has applied primarily to the
impact of geography on politics, but its usage has evolved over the past
century to encompass wider connotations. Geopolitics traditionally indicates
the links between political power and geographic space. In concrete terms it is
often seen as a body of thought examining strategic prescriptions based on the
relative importance of land power and sea power in world history. The
geopolitical tradition had some consistent concerns with regards to
geopolitical correlates of power in world politics, the identification of
international core areas, and the relationships between naval and terrestrial
capabilities. Academically, the study of geopolitics involves the analysis of
geography, history and social science with reference to spatial politics and
patterns at various scales. It is multidisciplinary in its scope, and includes
all aspects of the social sciences with particular emphasis on political
geography, international relations, the territorial aspects of political
science and international law. Also, the study of geopolitics includes the
study of the ensemble of relations between the interests of international
political actors, interests focused to an area, space, geographical element or
ways, relations which create a geopolitical system. Main schools and doctrines.
The term was coined at the beginning of the 20th century by Rudolf Kjell√©n
(1864‚Äì1922), a Swedish political scientist. Kjell√©n was inspired by the
German geographer Friedrich Ratzel, who published a book in 1897 titled
"Politische Geographie" (political geography). The book was later popularized
in English by the Hungarian historian Emile Reich and later by the American
diplomat Robert Strausz-Hup√©, a faculty member of the University of
Pennsylvania. Although Halford Mackinder had a pioneering role in the field, he
never used the term geopolitics himself. German Geopolitics. German Geopolitik
is characterized by the belief that life of States is similar to the one of
human beings and animals, mainly shaped by scientific determinism and Social
Darwinism. German geopolitics will thoroughly develop the concept of Lebensraum
(vital space) supposedly necessary to the development of a Nation alike a
favorable natural environment would be for animals. Ratzel. Friedrich Ratzel
(1844‚Äì1904), influenced by thinkers like Darwin and zoologist Ernst Heinrich
Haeckel, contributed to Geopolitik by the expansion on the biological
conception of geography, without a static conception of borders. States are
instead organic and growing, with borders representing only a temporary stop in
their movement. It is not the state proper that is the organism, but the land
in its spiritual bond with the people who draw sustenance from it. The expanse
of a state‚Äôs borders is a reflection of the health of the nation meaning that
static countries are in decline. He published several papers, among which the
essay Lebensraum (1901) concerning biogeography, creating a foundation for the
uniquely German variant of geopolitics: geopolitik. Influenced by the American
geostrategist Alfred Thayer Mahan, Ratzel wrote of aspirations for German naval
reach, agreeing that sea power was self-sustaining, as the profit from trade
would pay for the merchant marine, unlike land power. The geopolitical theory
of Ratzel has been criticized as being too sweeping, his interpretation of
human history and geography too simple and mechanistic. In his analysis of the
importance of mobility, and the move from sea to rail transport, he failed to
predict the revolutionary impact of air power. Critically also he
underestimated the importance of social organization in the development of
power. The association of German Geopolitiks with Nazism. After World War I,
the thoughts of Rudolf Kjell√©n and Ratzel were picked up and extended by a
number of German authors such as Karl Haushofer (1869‚Äì1946), Erich Obst,
Hermann Lautensach and Otto Maull. In 1923 Karl Haushofer founded the
"Zeitschrift f√ºr Geopolitik" (Journal for Geopolitics), which later proved
useful to Nazi Germany propaganda. The key concepts of Haushofer's Geopolitik
were Lebensraum, autarky, pan-regions and organic borders. States have,
Haushofer argued, undeniable right to seek natural borders which would
guarantee autarky. More recently Haushofer's influence within the Nazi Party
has been questioned (O'Tuathail, 1996) since Haushofer failed to incorporate
the Nazis' racial ideology into his work. Popular views of the role of
geopolitics in the Nazi Third Reich suggest a fundamental significance on the
part of the geopoliticians in the ideological orientation of the Nazi state.
Bassin (1987) reveals that these popular views are in important ways misleading
and incorrect. Despite the numerous similarities and affinities between the two
doctrines, geopolitics was always held suspect by the National Socialist
ideologists. This suspicion was understandable, for the underlying
philosophical orientation of geopolitics ran counter to that of National
Socialism. Geopolitics, deriving from the political geography of Ratzel, shared
his scientific materialism and determinism. Human society was determined by
external influences, in the face of which qualities held innately by
individuals or groups were of reduced or no significance. National Socialism
rejected in principle both materialism and determinism and also elevated innate
human qualities, in the form of a hypothesized 'racial character,' to the
factor of greatest significance in the constitution of human society. These
differences led after 1933 to friction and ultimately to open denunciation of
geopolitics by Nazi ideologues. Nevertheless, German Geopolitik was discredited
by its (mis)use in Nazi expansionist policy of World War II and has never
achieved standing comparable to the pre-war period. Anglo-American geopolitical
doctrine. Alfred Thayer Mahan and the sea power. Alfred Thayer Mahan, a
frequent commentator on world naval strategic and diplomatic affairs, believed
that national greatness was inextricably associated with the sea, with its
commercial usage in peace and its control in war. His goal was to discover the
laws of history that determined who controlled the seas. Emil Reich. Hungarian
historian Emil Reich (1854‚Äì1910) is considered to be the first having coined
the acception in English as early as 1902 and later in 1904 in his book
"Foundations of Modern Europe". Mackinder and the Heartland theory. The concept
of geopolitics initially gained attention through the work of Sir Halford
Mackinder in England and his formulation of the Heartland Theory which was set
out in his article entitled "The Geographical Pivot of History" in 1904.
Mackinder's doctrine of geopolitics involved concepts diametrically opposed to
the notion of Alfred Thayer Mahan about the significance of navies (he coined
the term "sea power") in world conflict. He saw navy as a basis of Colombian
era empire (roughly 1492‚Äì19th century) and expected 20th century to be domain
of land power. The Heartland theory hypothesized the possibility for a huge
empire being brought into existence in the Heartland, which wouldn't need to
use coastal or transoceanic transport to remain coherent. The basic notions of
Mackinder's doctrine involve considering the geography of the Earth as being
divided into two sections, the World Island or Core, comprising Eurasia and
Africa; the Peripheral "islands", including the Americas, Australia, Japan, the
British Isles, and Oceania. Not only was the Periphery noticeably smaller than
the World Island, it necessarily required much sea transport to function at the
technological level of the World Island, which contained sufficient natural
resources for a developed economy. Also, the industrial centers of the
Periphery were necessarily located in widely separated locations. The World
Island could send its navy to destroy each one of them in turn. It could locate
its own industries in a region further inland than the Periphery could, so they
would have a longer struggle reaching them, and would face a well-stocked
industrial bastion. Mackinder called this region the "Heartland". It
essentially comprised Eastern Europe: Ukraine, Western Russia, and
Mitteleuropa. The Heartland contained the grain reserves of Ukraine, and many
other natural resources. Mackinder's notion of geopolitics can be summed up in
his saying "Who rules East Europe commands the Heartland. Who rules the
Heartland commands the World-Island. Who rules the World-Island commands the
World." His doctrine was influential during the World Wars and the Cold War,
for Germany and later Russia each made territorial strides toward the
Heartland. Spykman and the Rimland. Nicholas J. Spykman could be considered as
a disciple and critic of both geostrategists Alfred Mahan, and Halford
Mackinder. His work is based on assumptions similar to Mackinder: the unity of
world politics, and the unity of the world sea. He extends this to include the
unity of the air. The purpose of Rimland is to separate Heartland from ports
usable throughout the year (not frozen up during winter), therefore any
attempts by Heartland nations (Russia) to conquer ports in the Rimland must be
prevented. Spykman modified Mackinder's formula on relationship between the
Heartand and the Rimland (or the inner crescent), he claimed, that "Who
controls the rimland rules Eurasia. Who rules Eurasia controls the destinies of
the world." This theory can be traced in the origins of Containment, a U.S.
policy on preventing the spread of Soviet influence after the World War II (see
also Truman Doctrine). Huntington. Since then, the word "geopolitics" has been
applied to other theories, most notably the notion of the Clash of
Civilizations by Samuel Huntington thoroughly inspired from Fernand Braudel in
Grammaire des civilisations. In a peaceable world, neither sea lanes nor
surface transport are threatened; hence all countries are effectively close
enough to one another physically. It is in the realm of the political ideas,
workings, and cultures that there are differences, and the term has shifted
more towards this arena, especially in its popular usage. Huntington‚Äôs
geopolitical model, especially the structures for North Africa and Eurasia, is
largely derived from the "Intermediate Region" geopolitical model first
formulated by Dimitri Kitsikis and published in 1978. French approach on
Geopolitics. French doctrines mainly relies in opposition to German Geopolitik
and rejects the idea of a fixed geography, hence French geography is focused on
the evolution of polymorphic territories being the result of mankind actions.
It also relies in the consideration of long time periods through refusal of
taking specific events into account. This Method has been theorized by
Professor Lacoste according to three principles: Representation, Diachronie;
Diatopie. Montesquieu. In The Spirit of the Laws, Montesquieu outlined the view
that man and societies are influenced by climate. He believed that hotter
climates create hot-tempered people and colder climates aloof people, whereas
the mild climate of France is ideal for political systems. √âlis√©e Reclus.
Considered as one of the founders of French geopolitics, Reclus, is the author
of a book considered as a reference in modern geography (Nouvelle G√©ographie
universelle). Alike Ratzel, he considers geography through a global vision.
However, in complete opposition to Ratzel's vision, Reclus considers geography
not to be unchanging; it is supposed to evolve in contingent with human
actions. His progressive political views got him rejected from the academic
establishment. Jacques Ancel. French geographer and geopolitician Jacques Ancel
is considered to be the first theorician of geopolitics in France notably
through the lectures he gave at the Carnegie foundation and his book
"G√©opolitique" published in 1936. Alike Reclus he rejects German determinist
views on geopolitics (such as Haushofer's doctrines). Fernand Braudel, Vidal de
la Blache. Braudel's broad view used insights from other social sciences,
employed the concept of the "longue dur√©e", and downplayed the importance of
specific events. This method was inspired by the French geographer Paul Vidal
de la Blache (himself influenced by German thought especially by Friedrich
Ratzel whom he had met in Germany). Moreover, Braudel's method consisted in
analysing the interdependence between individuals and their environment.
"Vidalian‚Äù geography is based on varied forms of cartography and on
"possibilism" (founded on a societal approach of geography i.e. on the
principle of spaces polymorphic faces depending from many factors among them
mankind, culture, and ideas) as opposed to "determinism". Yves Lacoste and the
rebirth of French Geopolitics. Because of the German Geopolitik influence on
French Geopolitics, the latter were for a long time banished from academic
works, often considered to be a Nazi science. In the mid-1970s, Yves Lacoste a
French geographer who was directly inspired by Ancel, Braudel and Vidal de la
Blache founded l'Institut Fran√ßais de G√©opolitique (French Institute for
Geopolitics) that publishes the H√©rodote revue. While rejecting
generalizations and broad abstractions employed by the German and Anglo-
American traditions, the school focuses on spatial dimension on different
levels of analysis. Fran√ßois Thual and Aymeric Chauprade : the new French
School of Geopolitics. French expert in geopolitics, former official of the
Ministry of Civil Defence who worked in several ministerial offices. He taught
geopolitics of the religions at the French War College and has written thirty
books devoted mainly to geopolitical method and its application to various
parts of the world. He is particularly interested in the Orthodox, Shiite and
Buddhist religions, and many troubled regions like the Caucasus. Advisor to the
Senate and teacher at the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes, his work is a
revival of French neo-realist geopolitics. He has inspired Aymeric Chauprade
which is very close and who succeeded him as professor of geopolitics of the
War School. Aymeric Chauprade, former professor of geopolitics at the French
War College, claims to a new French school of geopolitics, which advocates
above all a return to realpolitik, discipline de-ideologized. The thought of
this new school is expressed through the French Review of Geopolitics and the
International Academy of Geopolitics, Aymeric Chauprade which is the general
secretary. The foundations of Chauprade's geopolitcal thought is in the line of
roads open by the work of Fran√ßois Thual. Can be found elsewhere in the
introduction to his reference book Geopolitics, and constant changes in
history, guiding principles of this new school of geopolitics. It is in this
introduction Aymeric Chauprade illustrates his approach to the discipline of
geopolitics. For Aymeric Chauprade, one of the vectors of independence and
power for France is the Francophonie. Supporter of a Europe of nations at
Europe's borders (excluding Turkey), he advocates a policy of compromise with
Russia and supports the idea of a multipolar world which implies a balanced
relationship between China and the U.S.. It maintains strong relations with
Morocco, where he teaches and travels regularly to the Middle East, Central
Europe, Central Asia, Russia and China. Russian Geopolitics. The modern day
Russian Geopolitcs is centered on Eurasianist tradition and is highly
interlinked with politics. The trauma of the disintegration of the Soviet Union
left behind various views ranging from moderate ‚Äì stressing the unique
position of Russia between Europe and Asia ‚Äì to more extreme arguing for
Greater Russia aspirations (renaissance of Russian empire in the borders of the
former Soviet Union) associated with expansionist views of Alexandr Dugin.
Meta-geopolitics. The concept of geopolitics has evolved over time.
Nevertheless, in today‚Äôs globalised, interdependent and interconnected world
classical geopolitics provide only a partial picture of international
relations. New actors and issues, such as environmental policies, health,
education and diplomacy influence contemporary geopolitics and need to be taken
into account. The framework of "Meta"-geopolitics proposed by Nayef Al-Rodhan,
strives to account for this new and complex reality. It combines traditional
and new dimensions of geopolitics to offer a multidimensional view of power and
power relationships. The importance of geography is superseded by the
combination of hard- and soft- power tools that states can employ to project
power. "Meta"-geopolitics defines seven key dimensions of state power that
include social and health issues, domestic politics, economics, environment,
science and human potential, military and security issues, and international
diplomacy. The first capacity looks at the "demographics," "ethnic make-up",
the degree of "social peace" and cohesion, and the "population‚Äôs health"
within a state. The second capacity refers to a country‚Äôs "domestic
political" situation. States that face internal political turmoil can become
introverted and incapacitated when it comes to pursuing a strong foreign
policy. The "economic" power is the third capacity of "Meta"-geopolitics and
has significant geopolitical importance. Access to energy and other natural
resources are a fundamental part of this capacity. The way a state deals with
"environmental" issues refers to the fourth capacity of "Meta"-geopolitics and
affects a state‚Äôs power both, inside and outside its borders. The "human
potential" refers to the fifth dimension of the framework and represents a
central measure of a state‚Äôs power. Education, a skilled, reliable work
force, investments in scientific research and development are key indicators of
this capacity. Traditionally, a state‚Äôs "military power" and its ability to
deal with national security challenges have been used to gauge a state‚Äôs
power on the international scene. Increases in military capability can change
the relative power balance between states. The seventh and last capacity refers
to a state‚Äôs influence on the "diplomatic" front. For example, a state‚Äôs
membership in international organizations, its ideological leverage and
credibility are fundamental indicators of this capacity. The "Meta"-geopolitics
framework allows for the assessment of relative strengths and weaknesses as
well as predictions about future trends. Furthermore, while this analytical
grid is relevant for states it also applies to private and transnational
entities, which are playing an increasingly important role in contemporary
geopolitics.
