French Constitution of 1793 The Constitution of 24 June 1793 (), also known as
the Constitution of the Year I, or the The Montagnard Constitution (French:
"Constitution montagnarde"), was the constitution instated by the Montagnards
and by popular referendum under the First Republic during the French
Revolution. Drafted by the Committee of Public Safety which was enlarged with
the purpose of producing it, the text was presented to the National Convention
on 10 June and subsequently accepted by that body on 24 June 1793. The
constitution was then ratified by a popular referendum employing universal male
suffrage, following approval by 1,784,377 out of approximately 1,800,000
voters. The Convention found in the external and internal state of war
sufficient reason to maintain itself until peace and postponed the
Constitution's implementation. Though the Constitution was overwhelmingly
popular and its drafting and ratification buoyed popular support for the
Montagnards, the convention set it aside indefinitely on 10 October 1793 and
declared a "Revolutionary Government" until a future peace. The Constitution
was inspired by the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen of
1789, to which it added several rights: it proclaimed the superiority of
popular sovereignty over national sovereignty; various economic and social
rights (right of association, right to work and public assistance, right to
public education); the right of rebellion (and duty to rebel when the
government violates the right of the people); and the abolition of slavery
written in what is known as the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen of
1793. It was eventually supplanted by the French Constitution of 1795, which
established the Directory. The revolutionaries of 1848 were inspired by this
constitution and that it passed into the ideological armory of the Third
Republic (founded 1870). It represents a fundamental historical document, that
contributed much to the later democratic institutions and developments.
