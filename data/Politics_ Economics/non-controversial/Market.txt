Market A market is one of many varieties of systems, institutions, procedures,
social relations and infrastructures whereby parties engage in exchange. While
parties may exchange goods and services by barter, most markets rely on sellers
offering their goods or services (including labor) in exchange for money from
buyers. It can be said that a market is the process by which the prices of
goods and services are established. For a market to be competitive, there must
be more than a single buyer or seller. It has been suggested that two people
may trade, but it takes at least three persons to have a market, so that there
is competition on at least one of its two sides. However, competitive markets
rely on much larger numbers of both buyers and sellers. A market with single
seller and multiple buyers is a monopoly. A market with a single buyer and
multiple sellers is a monopsony. These are the extremes of imperfect
competition. In mainstream economics, the concept of a market is any structure
that allows buyers and sellers to exchange any type of goods, services and
information. The exchange of goods or services for money is a transaction.
Market participants consist of all the buyers and sellers of a good who
influence its price. This influence is a major study of economics and has given
rise to several theories and models concerning the basic market forces of
supply and demand. There are two roles in markets, buyers and sellers. The
market facilitates trade and enables the distribution and allocation of
resources in a society. Markets allow any tradable item to be evaluated and
priced. A market emerges more or less spontaneously or is constructed
deliberately by human interaction in order to enable the exchange of rights
(cf. ownership) of services and goods. Historically, markets originated in
physical marketplaces which would often develop into ‚Äî or from ‚Äî small
communities, towns and cities. Types of markets. Although many markets exist in
the traditional sense ‚Äî such as a marketplace ‚Äî there are various other
types of markets and various organizational structures to assist their
functions. The nature of business transactions could define markets. Financial
markets. Financial markets facilitate the exchange of liquid assets. Most
investors prefer investing in two markets, the stock markets and the bond
markets. NYSE, AMEX, and the NASDAQ are the most common stock markets in the
US. Futures markets, where contracts are exchanged regarding the future
delivery of goods are often an outgrowth of general commodity markets. Currency
markets are used to trade one currency for another, and are often used for
speculation on currency exchange rates. The money market is the name for the
global market for lending and borrowing. Prediction markets. Prediction markets
are a type of speculative market in which the goods exchanged are futures on
the occurrence of certain events. They apply the market dynamics to facilitate
information aggregation. Organization of markets. A market can be organized as
an auction, as a private electronic market, as a commodity wholesale market, as
a shopping center, as a complex institution such as a stock market, and as an
informal discussion between two individuals. Markets of varying types can
spontaneously arise whenever a party has interest in a good or service that
some other party can provide. Hence there can be a market for cigarettes in
correctional facilities, another for chewing gum in a playground, and yet
another for contracts for the future delivery of a commodity. There can be
black markets, where a good is exchanged illegally and virtual markets, such as
eBay, in which buyers and sellers do not physically interact during
negotiation. There can also be markets for goods under a command economy
despite pressure to repress them. Mechanisms of markets. In economics, a market
that runs under laissez-faire policies is a free market. It is "free" in the
sense that the government makes no attempt to intervene through taxes,
subsidies, minimum wages, price ceilings, etc. Market prices may be distorted
by a seller or sellers with monopoly power, or a buyer with monopsony power.
Such price distortions can have an adverse effect on market participant's
welfare and reduce the efficiency of market outcomes. Also, the relative level
of organization and negotiating power of buyers and sellers markedly affects
the functioning of the market. Markets where price negotiations meet
equilibrium though still do not arrive at desired outcomes for both sides are
said to experience market failure. There exists a popular thought that free
markets would have a structure of a perfect competition. The logic behind the
thought is that market failures are thought to be caused by other exogenic
systems, and after removing those exogenic systems ("freeing" the markets) the
free markets could run without market failures. As an argument against such a
logic there is a view that suggests that the source of market failures is
inside the market system, so the removal of other interfering systems would not
result in markets with a structure of perfect competition: capitalists don't
want to enhance the structure of markets, just like a coach of a football team
would influence the referees or would break the rules if he could while he is
pursuing his target of winning the game. The capitalists are not enhancing the
balance of their team versus the team of consumer-workers, so the market system
needs a "referee" from outside that balances the game. The role of a "referee"
of the market system is usually given to a democratic government. Study of
markets. A widespread trend in economic history and sociology is skeptical of
the idea that it is possible to develop a theory to capture an essence or
unifying thread to markets. For economic geographers, reference to regional,
local, or commodity specific markets can serve to undermine assumptions of
global integration, and highlight geographic variations in the structures,
institutions, histories, path dependencies, forms of interaction and modes of
self-understanding of agents in different spheres of market exchange. Reference
to actual markets can show capitalism not as a totalizing force or completely
encompassing mode of economic activity, but rather as "a set of economic
practices scattered over a landscape, rather than a systemic concentration of
power". C. B. Macpherson identifies an underlying model of the market
underlying Anglo-American liberal-democratic political economy and philosophy
in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries: Persons are cast as self-
interested individuals, who enter into contractual relations with other such
individuals, concerning the exchange of goods or personal capacities cast as
commodities, with the motive of maximizing pecuniary interest. The state and
its governance systems are cast as outside of this framework. This model came
to dominant economic thinking in the later nineteenth century, as economists
such as Ricardo, Mill, Jevons, Walras and later neo-classical economics shifted
from reference to geographically located marketplaces to an abstract "market".
This tradition is continued in contemporary neoliberalism, where the market is
held up as optimal for wealth creation and human freedom, and the states‚Äô
role imagined as minimal, reduced to that of upholding and keeping stable
property rights, contract, and money supply. This allowed for boilerplate
economic and institutional restructuring under structural adjustment and post-
Communist reconstruction. Similar formalism occurs in a wide variety of social
democratic and Marxist discourses that situate political action as antagonistic
to the market. In particular, commodification theorists such as Georg Luk√°cs
insist that market relations necessarily lead to undue exploitation of labour
and so need to be opposed in toto. Pierre Bourdieu has suggested the market
model is becoming self-realizing, in virtue of its wide acceptance in national
and international institutions through the 1990s. The formalist conception
faces a number of insuperable difficulties, concerning the putatively global
scope of the market to cover the entire Earth, in terms of penetration of
particular economies, and in terms of whether particular claims about the
subjects (individuals with pecuniary interest), objects (commodities), and
modes of exchange (transactions) apply to any actually existing markets. A
central theme of empirical analyses is the variation and proliferation of types
of markets since the rise of capitalism and global scale economies. The
Regulation school stresses the ways in which developed capitalist countries
have implemented varying degrees and types of environmental, economic, and
social regulation, taxation and public spending, fiscal policy and government
provisioning of goods, all of which have transformed markets in uneven and
geographical varied ways and created a variety of mixed economies. Drawing on
concepts of institutional variance and path dependency, varieties of capitalism
theorists (such as Hall and Soskice) identify two dominant modes of economic
ordering in the developed capitalist countries, "coordinated market economies"
such as Germany and Japan, and an Anglo-American "liberal market economies".
However, such approaches imply that the Anglo-American liberal market
economies, in fact, operate in a matter close to the abstract notion of "the
market". While Anglo-American countries have seen increasing introduction of
neo-liberal forms of economic ordering, this has not led to simple convergence,
but rather a variety of hybrid institutional orderings. Rather, a variety of
new markets have emerged, such as for carbon trading or rights to pollute. In
some cases, such as emerging markets for water, different forms of
privatization of different aspects of previously state run infrastructure have
created hybrid private-public formations and graded degrees of commodification,
commercialization, and privatization. Problematic for market formalism is the
relationship between formal capitalist economic processes and a variety of
alternative forms, ranging from semi-feudal and peasant economies widely
operative in many developing economies, to informal markets, barter systems,
worker cooperatives, or illegal trades that occur in most developed countries.
Practices of incorporation of non-Western peoples into global markets in the
nineteenth and twentieth century did not merely result in the quashing of
former social economic institutions. Rather, various modes of articulation
arose between transformed and hybridized local traditions and social practices
and the emergence world economy. So called capitalist markets, in fact, include
and depend on a wide range of geographically situated economic practices that
do not follow the market model. Economies are thus hybrids of market and non-
market elements. Helpful here is J. K. Gibson-Graham‚Äôs complex topology of
the diversity of contemporary market economies describing different types of
transactions, labour, and economic agents. Transactions can occur in
underground markets (such as for marijuana) or be artificially protected (such
as for patents). They can cover the sale of public goods under privatization
schemes to co-operative exchanges and occur under varying degrees of monopoly
power and state regulation. Likewise, there are a wide variety of economic
agents, which engage in different types of transactions on different terms: One
cannot assume the practices of a religious kindergarten, multinational
corporation, state enterprise, or community-based cooperative can be subsumed
under the same logic of calculability (pp.¬ 53‚Äì78). This emphasis on
proliferation can also be contrasted with continuing scholarly attempts to show
underlying cohesive and structural similarities to different markets. A
prominent entry-point for challenging the market model's applicability concerns
exchange transactions and the "homo economicus" assumption of self-interest
maximization. a number of streams of economic sociological analysis of markets
focus on the role of the social in transactions, and on the ways transactions
involve social networks and relations of trust, cooperation and other bonds.
Economic geographers in turn draw attention to the ways in exchange
transactions occur against the backdrop of institutional, social and geographic
processes, including class relations, uneven development, and historically
contingent path-dependencies. Michel Callon's concept of framing provides a
useful schema: each economic act or transaction occurs against, incorporates
and also re-performs a geographically and cultural specific complex of social
histories, institutional arrangements, rules and connections. These network
relations are simultaneously bracketed, so that persons and transactions may be
disentangled from thick social bonds. The character of calculability is imposed
upon agents as they come to work in markets and are "formatted" as calculative
agencies. Market exchanges contain a history of struggle and contestation that
produced actors predisposed to exchange under c An emerging theme worthy of
further study is the interrelationship, interpenetrability and variations of
concepts of persons, commodities, and modes of exchange under particular market
formations. This is most pronounced in recent movement towards post-
structuralist theorizing that draws on Foucault and Actor Network Theory and
stress relational aspects of personhood, and dependence and integration into
networks and practical systems. Commodity network approaches further both
deconstruct and show alternatives to the market models concept of commodities.
Here, both researchers and market actors are understood as reframing
commodities in terms of processes and social and ecological relationships.
Rather than a mere objectification of things traded, the complex network
relationships of exchange in different markets calls on agents to alternatively
deconstruct or ‚Äúget with‚Äù the fetish of commodities. Gibson-Graham thus
read a variety of alternative markets, for fair trade and organic foods, or
those using Local Exchange Trading Systems as not only contributing to
proliferation, but also forging new modes of ethical exchange and economic
subjectivities. Size parameters. "Market size" can be given in terms of the
number of buyers and sellers in a particular market or in terms of the total
exchange of money in the market, generally annually (per year). When given in
terms of money, market size is often termed "market value", but in a sense
distinct from market value of individual products. For one and the same goods,
there may be different (and generally increasing) market values at the
production level, the wholesale level and the retail level. For example, the
value of the global illicit drug market for the year 2003 was estimated by the
United Nations to be US$13 billion at the production level, $94 billion at the
wholesale level (taking seizures into account), and US$322 billion at the
retail level (based on retail prices and taking seizures and other losses into
account).
