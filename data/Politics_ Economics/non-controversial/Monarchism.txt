Monarchism Monarchism is a system based on the belief that political power
should be concentrated in one person who rules by decree. A monarchist is an
individual who supports this form of government, independent from the person,
the monarch. In this system, the Monarch may be the person who sits on the
throne, a pretender, or someone who would otherwise inhabit the throne but has
been deposed. In 1687-88, the Glorious Revolution and the overthrow of King
James II established the principles of constitutional monarchy, which would
later be worked out by Montesquieu and other thinkers. However, absolute
monarchy, theorized by Hobbes in the "Leviathan" (1651), remained a dominant
principle. In the 18th century, Voltaire and others encouraged "enlightened
absolutism", which was embraced by the Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II and
Catherine II of Russia. Absolutism continued to be the dominant political
principle of sovereignty until the 1789 French Revolution and the regicide
against Louis XVI, which established the concept of popular sovereignty upheld
by Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Monarchy began to be contested by the Republican
principe. Counterrevolutionaries, such as Joseph de Maistre or Louis de Bonald,
sought the restoration of the "Ancien RÃ©gime", divided in the three estates of
the realm, and the divine right of kings. Following the ousting of Napoleon I
in 1814, the Coalition restored the Bourbon Dynasty in pushing Louis XVIII to
the French throne. The ensuing period, called the Restoration, was
characterized by a sharp conservative reaction and the re-establishment of the
Roman Catholic Church, supported by the ultramontanism movement, as a power in
French politics. After the 1830 July Revolution and the overthrow of Charles X,
the legitimist branch was defeated and the Orleanists, gathered behind Louis-
Philippe, accepted the principle of constitutional monarchy. The Spring of
Nations in 1848 then set the signal for a new wave of revolutions against the
European monarchies. World War I and its aftermath saw the end of three major
European monarchies, the Russian Romanov dynasty, the German Hohenzollern
dynasty and the Austro-Hungarian Habsburg dynasty. In Russia, the 1917 February
revolution resulted in the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II and the establishment
of Bolshevik Russia and a civil war between the Bolshevik Red Army and the
monarchist White Army from 1917 to 1921. The rise of the Hungarian Soviet
Republic in 1919 saw an increase in support for monarchism, however efforts by
Hungarian monarchists failed to bring back a royal head of state, and the
monarchists settled for a regent, Admiral MiklÃ³s Horthy, to represent the
monarchy until it could be restored. Horthy was regent from 1920 to 1944. In
Germany a number of monarchists gathered around the German National People's
Party which demanded the return of the Hohenzollern monarchy and an end to the
Weimar Republic. The party retained a large base of support until the rise of
Nazism in the 1930s. With the arrival of Communism in Eastern Europe by 1945,
the remaining Eastern European monarchies such as the Kingdom of Romania, the
Kingdom of Hungary, the Kingdom of Bulgaria and the Kingdom of Yugoslavia were
all abolished and replaced by socialist republics. The aftermath of World War
II also saw the return of monarchist and republican rivalry in Italy, in which
a referendum was held on whether Italy should remain a monarchy or become a
republic. The republican side won the referendum (by a narrow margin) and the
modern Republic of Italy was created. Monarchism as a political force
internationally has substantially diminished since the end of the Second World
War, though it had an important role in the 1979 Iranian Revolution and also
played a role in the modern political affairs of Nepal. Nepal was one of the
last states to have had an absolute monarch, which continued until King
Gyanendra of Nepal was peacefully deposed in May 2008 and Nepal became a
federal republic. One of the world's oldest monarchies was abolished in
Ethiopia in 1974 with the fall of Emperor Haile Selassie. Constitutional
monarchies. Constitutional monarchies form the majority of the current
monarchies. Since the middle of the 19th century, some monarchists have stopped
defending monarchy on the basis of abstract, universal principles applicable to
all nations, or even on the grounds that a monarchy would be the best or most
practical government for the nation in question, but on local symbolic grounds
that they would be a particular nation's link to the past. The International
Monarchist League, founded in 1943, which has been very influential in Canada
and Australia, has always sought to promote monarchy on the grounds that it
strengthens popular liberty, both in a democracy and in a dictatorship, because
by definition the monarch is not beholden to politicians. Hence, post-19th
century debates on whether to preserve a monarchy or to adopt a republican form
of government have often been debates over national identity, with the monarch
generally serving as a symbol for other issues. For example, in countries like
Belgium and the Netherlands anti-monarchist talk is often centered around the
perceived symbolism of a monarch contrasting with those nation's political
culture of egalitarianism. In Belgium, another factor are the anti-Belgian
sentiments of the separatist Flemish movement. In Canada and Australia, by
contrast, debates over monarchy represent or represented debates whose driving
force concerned each nation's relationship with the United Kingdom and the
cultural heritage that that represents. In a nation like Saudi Arabia, finally,
opposition to the monarchy may be synonmous with advocacy of democracy or
Islamic fundamentalism. As monarchies take many different forms, so too do pro-
and anti-monarchy debates. Otto von Habsburg advocated a form of constitutional
monarchy based on the primacy of the supreme judicial function, with hereditary
succession. Mediation by a tribunal is warranted if suitability is
