Import substitution industrialization Import substitution industrialization or
"Import-substituting Industrialization" (often called ISI) is a trade and
economic policy that advocates replacing foreign imports with domestic
production. ISI is based on the premise that a country should attempt to reduce
its foreign dependency through the local production of industrialized products.
The term primarily refers to 20th century development economics policies,
although it has been advocated since the 18th century by classical economists
such as David Ricardo, John Stuart Mill and Friedrich List. ISI policies were
enacted by countries within the Global South with the intention of producing
development and self-sufficiency through the creation of an internal market.
ISI works by having the state lead economic development through
nationalization, subsidization of vital industries (including agriculture,
power generation, etc.), increased taxation, and highly protectionist trade
policies. Import substitution industrialization was gradually abandoned by
developing countries in the 1980s and 1990s due to structural indebtedness from
ISI related policies on the insistence of the IMF and World Bank through their
structural adjustment programs of market-driven liberalization aimed at the
Global South. In the context of Latin America development, the term Latin
American structuralism refers to the era of import substitution
industrialization in many Latin American countries from the 1950s until the
1980s. The theories behind Latin American structuralism and ISI were organized
in the works of Ra√∫l Prebisch, Hans Singer, Celso Furtado and other structural
economic thinkers, and gained prominence with the creation of the United
Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (UNECLAC or
CEPAL). While the theorists behind ISI or Latin American structuralism were not
homogeneous and did not belong to one particular school of economic thought,
ISI and Latin American structuralism and the theorists who developed its
economic frame work shared a basic common belief in a state-directed, centrally
planned form of economic development. In promoting state-induced
industrialization through governmental spending through the infant industry
argument, ISI and Latin American structuralist approaches to development are
largely influenced through a wide-range of Keynesian, communitarian and
socialist economic thought. ISI is often associated and linked with dependency
theory, although the latter has traditionally adopted a much broader
sociological framework in addressing the cultural origins of underdevelopment
through the historical effects of colonialism, Eurocentrism, and neoliberalism.
History. Even though ISI is a development theory, its political implementation
and theoretical rationale are rooted in trade theory: it has been argued that
all or virtually all nations that have industrialized have followed ISI. Import
Substitution was heavily practiced during the mid-1900s as a form of
developmental theory which believed to increase productivity and economic gains
within a country. This was an inward- looking economic theory practiced by
developed nations post WW2. Many economists at the time considered the ISI
approach as a remedy to mass poverty; to bring a third world country to first
world standing through national industrialization. Mass poverty is defined as
the: "the dominance of agricultural and mineral activities-in the low-income
countries, and in their inability, because of their structure, to profit from
international trade," (Bruton 905). Mercantilist economic theory and practices
of the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries frequently advocated building up domestic
manufacturing and import substitution. In the early United States, the
Hamiltonian economic program, specifically the third report and the "magnum
opus" of Alexander Hamilton, the "Report on Manufactures", advocated for the US
to become self-sufficient in manufactured goods. This formed the basis of the
American School, which was an influential force during the United States in the
19th century industrialization. Werner Baer contends that all countries that
have industrialized after the United Kingdom went through a stage of ISI in
which the large part of investment in industry was directed to replace imports
(Baer, pp.¬ 95‚Äì96). Going farther, in his book "Kicking Away the Ladder",
Korean economist Ha-Joon Chang also argues, based on economic history, that all
major developed countries, including the United Kingdom, used interventionist
economic policies to promote industrialization and protected national companies
until they had reached a level of development in which they were able to
compete in the global market, after which those countries adopted free market
discourses directed at other countries to obtain two objectives: open their
markets to local products and prevent them from adopting the same development
strategies that led to the developed nations' industrialization. Theoretical
basis. As a set of development policies, ISI policies are theoretically
grounded on the Singer-Prebisch thesis, on the infant industry argument, and on
Keynesian economics. From these postulates, it derives a body of practices,
which are commonly: an active industrial policy to subsidize and orchestrate
production of strategic substitutes, protective barriers to trade (such as
tariffs), an overvalued currency to help manufacturers import capital goods
(heavy machinery), and discouragement of foreign direct investment. Due to the
exploitation the laissez-faire market indirectly performs third world countries
began to self-rely on themselves. To fight mass poverty of the respected
country, ISI was an implement for the infant-industry argument. To compete in
the world market with first world countries, third world and/or developing
countries would protect their "infant" new industries until a sufficient amount
of knowledge, capital and comparative advantage is accumulated. Harold J.
Burton in his paper ‚ÄòA Reconsideration of Import Substitution‚Äô states: "The
very idea of import substitution implied this: keep out that which is now
imported from the North and produce it at home," (Bruton 910). That is the
North developed and industrialized markets will not be a factor or a source for
resources for the undeveloped and developing south. By placing high tariffs on
imports and other protectionist, inward-looking trade policies the citizens of
the respected country by simple supply and demand rationale will substitute the
lesser expensive good for the more expensive. The primary industry of
importance would gather its resources such as labour from other industries in
this situation; the industrial industry would use resources, capital and labour
from the agricultural. In time a third world country would look and behave
similar to a first world and with the new accumulation of capital and
comparative advantage, and the increase of TFP (total factor productivity) the
nation's industry will be capable to trade internationally and compete in the
world market. Bishwanath Goldar in his paper ‚ÄòImport Substitution, Industrial
Concentration and Productivity Growth in Indian Manufacturing‚Äô writes:
"Earlier studies on productivity for the industrial sector of developing
countries have indicated that increases in total factor productivity, (TFP) are
an important source of industrial growth," (Goldar 143). He continues that "a
higher growth rate in output, other things remaining the same, would enable the
industry to attain a higher rate of technological progress (since more
investment would be made) and create a situation in which the constituent firms
could take greater advantage of scale economies;" it is believed that ISI will
allow this (Goldar 148). In many cases, however, these postulates did not
apply: on several occasions, the Brazilian ISI process, which occurred from
1930 until the end of the 1980s, involved currency devaluation as a means of
boosting exports and discouraging imports (thus promoting the consumption of
locally manufactured products), as well as the adoption of different exchange
rates for importing capital goods and for importing consumer goods. Moreover,
governmental policies toward investment were not always opposed to foreign
capital: the Brazilian industrialization process was based on a tripod which
involved governmental, private, and foreign capital, the first being directed
to infrastructure and heavy industry, the second to manufacturing consumer
goods, and the third, to the production of durable goods (such as automobiles).
Volkswagen, Ford, GM and Mercedes all established in Brazil in the 1950s and
1960s. The major and unifying postulate of ISI can thus be described as an
attempt to reduce foreign dependency of a country's economy through local
production of industrialized products, whether through national or foreign
investment, for domestic or foreign consumption. It should be noted, as well,
that import substitution does not mean "import elimination": as a country
industrializes, it begins to import other kinds of goods which become necessary
for its industry, such as petroleum, chemicals, and the raw materials it may
lack. The real objective of import substitution is therefore not to eliminate
trade but to lift it to higher stage, that of exporting "value-added" products,
not as susceptible to economic fluctuations as raw materials, according to the
Singer-Prebisch thesis. Latin America. Import substitution policies were
adopted by most nations in Latin America from the 1930s until the late 1980s.
The initial date is largely attributed to the impact of the Great Depression of
the 1930s, when Latin American countries, which exported primary products and
imported almost all of the industrialized goods they consumed, were prevented
from importing due to a sharp decline in their foreign sales. This served as an
incentive for the domestic production of the goods they needed. The first steps
in import substitution were less theoretical and more pragmatic choices on how
to face the limitations imposed by recession, even though the governments in
Argentina (Juan Domingo Per√≥n) and Brazil (Get√∫lio Vargas) had the precedent
of Fascist Italy (and, to some extent, the Soviet Union) as inspirations of
state-induced industrialization. Positivist thinking, which sought a "strong
government" to "modernize" society, played a major influence on Latin American
military thinking in the 20th century. Among the officials, many of whom rose
to power, like Per√≥n and Vargas, industrialization (especially steel
production) was synonymous with "progress" and was naturally placed as a
priority. ISI gained a theoretical foundation only in the 1950s, when Argentine
economist and UNECLAC head Ra√∫l Prebisch was a visible proponent of the idea,
as well as Brazilian economist Celso Furtado. Prebisch believed that developing
countries needed to create local vertical linkages, and they could only succeed
by creating industries that used the primary products already being produced
domestically. The tariffs were designed to allow domestic infant industries to
prosper. ISI was most successful in countries with large populations and income
levels which allowed for the consumption of locally produced products. Latin
American countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, and (to a lesser extent)
Chile, Uruguay and Venezuela, had the most success with ISI. This is so because
while the investment to produce cheap consumer products may pay off in a small
consumer market, the same can not be said for capital-intensive industries,
such as automobiles and heavy machinery, which depend on larger consumer
markets to survive. Thus, smaller and poorer countries, such as Ecuador,
Honduras, and the Dominican Republic, could implement ISI only to a limited
extent. Peru implemented ISI in 1961, and the policy lasted through to the end
of the decade in some form. To overcome the difficulties of implementing ISI in
small-scale economies, proponents of this economic policy, some within UNECLAC,
suggested two alternatives to enlarge consumer markets: income distribution
within each country, through agrarian reform and other initiatives aimed at
bringing Latin America's enormous marginalized population into the consumer
market, and regional integration through initiatives such as the Latin American
Free Trade Association (ALALC), which would allow for the products of one
country to be sold in another. In Latin American countries in which ISI was
most successful, it was accompanied by structural changes to the government.
Old neocolonial governments were replaced by more or less democratic
governments. Banks and utilities and certain foreign-owned companies were
nationalized or transferred ownership to local businesspeople. Many economists
contend that ISI failed in Latin America and was one of many factors leading to
the so-called lost decade of Latin American economics,while others contend that
ISI led to the "Mexican Miracle", the period that lasted from 1940 to 1975 in
which economic growth stood at 6% or higher. ‚ÄúBy the early 1960s, domestic
industry supplied 95 per cent of Mexico‚Äôs and 98 per cent of Brazil‚Äôs
consumer goods. From 1950 to 1980 Latin America‚Äôs industrial output went up
six times keeping well ahead of population growth. Infant mortality fell from
107 per 1000 live births in 1960 to 69 per 1000 in 1980, life expectancy rose
from 52 to 64 years. In the mid 1950s, Latin America‚Äôs economies were growing
faster than those of the industrialized West.‚Äù Advantages and disadvantages.
The major advantages claimed for ISI include increases in domestic employment
(reducing dependence on labour non-intensive industries such as raw resource
extraction and export); resilience in the face of a global economic shocks
(such as recessions and depressions); less long-distance transportation of
goods (and concomitant fuel consumption and greenhouse gas and other
emissions). A disadvantage claimed for ISI is that the industries that it
creates are inefficient and obsolete as they are not exposed to internationally
competitive industries, which constitute their rivals, and that the focus on
industrial development impoverishes local commodity producers, who are
primarily rural. Rather than maintain an ‚Äòinward-looking‚Äô economy, the idea
of catching up can be much faster with strong competition rather than the
domestic competition of people with similar levels of human capital. In
continuation, with small external scale economies, the country's costs maintain
high and knowledge accumulation will not steadily or slowly increase. Goldar
takes note that in India "that policies of import substitution and domestic
industrial licensing have led to considerable inefficiency in the industrial
sector, and that policies for checking concentration (restrictions against
large industrial houses, discrimination in favour of small scale units, etc.)
have resulted in significant loss of scale economies," (Goldar 144).
Additionally, import substitution was in place as a remedy for mass poverty,
unemployment and economic growth however, "The collections of Balassa and
Little et al. made abundantly clear that import substitution policies had
created major distortions and had thereby resulted in a misuse of resources. 33
So it was increasingly evident that something needed fixing. Two other sources
of concern appeared in the early 1970s and suggested that there were other
things that needed fixing as well. The first, already referred to, was that the
demand for labor in the new activities was growing more slowly than the rates
of growth of output and investment had led most observers to expect. As a
consequence of the slow growth of employment (and other things), poverty was
alleviated only modestly," (Bruton 917).
