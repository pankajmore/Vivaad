Alexandre-Théodore-Victor, comte de Lameth Alexandre-Théodore-Victor, comte
de Lameth (20 October 1760 – 18 March 1829) was a French soldier and
politician. He was born in Paris. Having served in the American War of
Independence under Rochambeau, he was sent in 1789 as deputy to the "States-
General" by the nobles of the "bailliage" of Péronne. In the Constituent
Assembly he formed with Barnave and Adrien Duport a "Triumvirate," which
controlled a group of about forty deputies forming the advanced left of the
Assembly. He presented a famous report in the Constituent Assembly on the
organization of the army, but is better known by his eloquent speech on 28
February 1791, at the Jacobin Club, against Honoré Mirabeau, whose relations
with the court were beginning to be suspected, and who was a personal enemy of
Lameth. However, after the flight of Louis XVI to Varennes, Lameth became
reconciled with the court. He served in the army as "maréchal-de-camp" under
Nicolas Luckner and the Marquis de la Fayette, but was accused of treason on 15
August 1792, fled the country, and was imprisoned by the Austrians. After his
release he went into business at Hamburg with his brother Charles and the duc
d'Aiguillon, and did not return to France until the Consulate. Under the Empire
he was made prefect successively in several departments, and in 1810 was
created a baron. In 1814 he attached himself to the Bourbons, and under the
Restoration was appointed prefect of Somme, deputy for Seine-Inférieure and
finally deputy for Seine-et-Oise, in which capacity he was a leader of the
Liberal opposition. He was the author of an important History of the
Constituent Assembly (Paris, 2 vols., 1828–1829). He had two brothers,
Théodore Lameth (1756–1854) who served in the American war, sat in the
Legislative Assembly as deputy from the department of Jura, and became
maréchal-de-camp; and Charles Malo François Lameth.
