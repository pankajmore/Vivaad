Johns Hopkins University The Johns Hopkins University (informally Johns
Hopkins, JHU, or just Hopkins) is a private research university based in
Baltimore, Maryland, United States. The university was founded on January 22,
1876 and named for its benefactor, the philanthropist Johns Hopkins. Daniel
Coit Gilman was inaugurated as the first president on February 22, 1876. Johns
Hopkins maintains campuses in Maryland; Washington, D.C.; Italy; China and
Singapore. The university is organized into two undergraduate divisions and
five graduate divisions on two main campusesâ€”the Homewood campus and the
Medical Institutions campusâ€”both located in Baltimore. The university also
consists of the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies, the
Peabody Institute, the Carey Business School, and various other facilities.
Johns Hopkins pioneered the concept of the modern research university in the
United States and has ranked among the world's top such universities throughout
its history. The National Science Foundation (NSF) has ranked Johns Hopkins #1
among U.S. academic institutions in total science, medical and engineering
research and development spending for 31 consecutive years. As of 2011, thirty-
seven Nobel Prize winners have been affiliated with Johns Hopkins, and the
university's research is among the most cited in the world. History. The
philanthropist and the founding. On his death in 1873, Johns Hopkins, a Quaker
entrepreneur and childless bachelor, bequeathed $7 million (between $140
million to $1.6 billion in 2011 dollars, by varying estimates) to fund a
hospital and university in Baltimore, Maryland. At that time this fortune,
generated primarily from the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, was the largest
philanthropic gift in the history of the United States. The first name of
philanthropist Johns Hopkins is the surname of his great-grandmother, Margaret
Johns, who married Gerard Hopkins. They named their son Johns Hopkins, who
named his own son Samuel Hopkins. Samuel named one of his sons after his father
and that son would be the university's benefactor. In his 2001 undergraduate
commencement address, university president William R. Brody said about the
name: "In 1888, just 12 years after the university was founded, Mark Twain
wrote about this university in a letter to a friend. He said: 'A few months ago
I was told that the Johns Hopkins University had given me a degree. I naturally
supposed this constituted me a Member of the Faculty and so I started in to
help as I could there. I told them I believed they were perfectly competent to
run a college as far as the higher branches of education are concerned, but
what they needed was a little help here and there from a practical commercial
man. I said the public is sensitive to little things and they wouldn't have
full confidence in a college that didn't know how to spell the name "John".'
More than a century later, we continue to bestow diplomas upon individuals of
outstanding capabilities and great talent. And we continue to spell "Johns"
with an "s"." Milton Eisenhower, a former university president, once spoke at a
convention in Pittsburgh where the Master of Ceremonies introduced him as
"President of "John" Hopkins." Eisenhower retorted that he was "glad to be here
in "Pitt"burgh." Early years and Daniel Coit Gilman. The original board opted
for an entirely novel university model dedicated to the discovery of knowledge
at an advanced level, extending that of contemporary Germany. Johns Hopkins
thereby became the model of the modern research university in the United
States. Its success eventually shifted higher education in the United States
from a focus on teaching revealed and/or applied knowledge to the scientific
discovery of new knowledge. The founders intended the university to be national
in scope to strengthen ties across a divided country in the aftermath of the
American Civil War. Therefore, the university's official inauguration took on
great significance: 1876 was the nation's centennial year and February 22 was
George Washington's birthday. The University's viability depended on its first
president, Daniel Coit Gilman, recruited from the presidency of the University
of California. Gilman launched what many at the time considered an audacious
and unprecedented academic experiment to merge teaching and research. He
dismissed the idea that the two were mutually exclusive: "The best teachers are
usually those who are free, competent and willing to make original researches
in the library and the laboratory," he stated. To implement his plan, Gilman
recruited internationally known luminaries such as the biologist H. Newell
Martin; the physicist Henry A. Rowland (the first president of the American
Physical Society), the classical scholars Basil Gildersleeve and Charles D.
Morris; the economist Richard T. Ely; and the chemist Ira Remsen, who became
the second president of the university in 1901. Gilman focused on the expansion
of knowledge, graduate education and support of faculty research. To Gilman,
Johns Hopkins existed not for the sake of God, the state, the community, the
board, the parents, or even the students, but for knowledge. Faculty who added
to such knowledge were rewarded. A complementary focus on graduate education
fused advanced scholarship with such professional schools as medicine and
engineering. Hopkins became the national trendsetter in doctoral programs and
the host for numerous scholarly journals and associations with the founding of
the first U.S. university press in 1878. With the completion of Johns Hopkins
Hospital in 1889 and the medical school in 1893, the university's
researchâ€“focused mode of instruction soon began attracting world-renowned
faculty members who would become major figures in the emerging field of
academic medicine, including William Osler, William Halsted, Howard Kelly, and
William Welch. During this period Hopkins made more history by becoming the
first medical school to admit women on an equal basis with men and to require a
Bachelors degree, based on the efforts of Mary E. Garrett, who had endowed the
school at Gilman's request. In his will and in his instructions to the trustees
of the university and the hospital, Hopkins requested that both institutions be
built upon the vast grounds of his Baltimore estate, Clifton. When Gilman
assumed the presidency, he decided that it would be best to use the
university's endowment for recruiting faculty and students, deciding to "build
men, not buildings." In his will Hopkins stipulated that none of his endowment
should be used for construction; only interest on the principal could be used
for this purpose. Unfortunately, stocks in The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad,
which would have generated most of the interest, became virtually worthless
soon after Hopkins's death. The university's first home was thus in Downtown
Baltimore delaying plans to site the university in Clifton. This decision
became the only major criticism of Gilman's presidency. In the early 20th
century the university outgrew its buildings and the trustees began to search
for a new home. Developing Clifton for the university was too costly, and so
the estate became a public park. In the end, the estate in north Baltimore
known as Homewood was purchased as the university's new campus with assistance
from prominent Baltimore citizens. Since the 1910s, Johns Hopkins University
has famously been a "fertile cradle" to Arthur Lovejoy's history of ideas.
Institutions. The Johns Hopkins University Press, founded in 1878, is the
oldest American university press in continuous operation. Along with the
hospital, Hopkins established one of the nation's oldest schools of nursing in
1889. The school of medicine was America's first coeducational, graduate-level
medical school, and was a prototype for academic medicine that emphasized
bedside learning, research projects, and laboratory training. In 1909, the
university was among the first to start adult continuing education programs and
in 1916 it founded the US' first school of public health. Programs in
international studies and the performing arts were established in 1950 and 1977
when the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies in Washington
D.C and the Peabody Institute in Baltimore became divisions of the university.
Civil rights. African-Americans. Hopkins was a prominent abolitionist who
supported Abraham Lincoln during the American Civil War. After his death,
reports said his conviction was a decisive factor in enrolling Hopkins' first
African-American student, Kelly Miller, a graduate student in physics,
astronomy and mathematics, and in admitting Harvard-trained physician Whitfield
Winsey and two other African-American physicians to Maryland's Medical and
Chirurgical Society MedChi. These physicians could attend meetings only because
they were held on campus. As the memory of Hopkins faded and trustees like King
died, Hopkins became like other Baltimore institutions, particularly in terms
of race. The Johns Hopkins University chronology stated that on March 15, 1892,
an administrator hired by Gilman recommended that the hospital should have a
"â€¦separate ward for colored patients." Johns Hopkins Hospital subsequently
became segregated. Johns Hopkins' "separate but equal" stance was evident when
it came to these segregated wards: "Special care will be taken to see that the
heating and ventilation apparatus is as perfect as possible. A sun balcony will
be erected on each floor on the east side, for convalescents, while a sun bay-
window will be constructed at the south end of the south wing. On each floor
there will be a dining room, kitchen, lavatory and bath-rooms...The building
will be fireproof throughout." As segregation grew within Johns Hopkins
institutions, it affected pay, hiring and promotions. Staff in segregated wards
and those employed in the lower rungs of the service industries had the longest
history within the Johns Hopkins Institutions. Johns Hopkins' students,
physicians, administrators and staff of African descent had a much shorter
history within these institutions. The first black undergraduate was Frederick
Scott who entered the school in 1945. In 1967 the first black students earned
graduate degrees. Dr. James Nabwangu a British-trained Kenyan, was the first
black graduate of the medical school. A second was earned by Robert Gamble. The
first African-American instructor was laboratory supervisor Vivien Thomas, who
also invented and developed research instruments, served as an assistant in
surgery to surgeon Alfred Blalock and worked closely with Blalock and Helen
Taussig in developing and conducting the first successful blue baby operation.
Black students and professionals were rare at Johns Hopkins Institutions and
Maryland's state medical societies until after the 1940s. Diversity increased
only in the 1960s and 1970s. African-Americans and women were labeled "The
Uninvited" in the second major history of the university. Women. Hopkins' most
wellâ€“known battle for women's rights was the one led by daughters of trustees
of the university; Mary E. Garrett, M. Carey Thomas, Mamie Gwinn, Elizabeth
King, and Julia Rogers. They donated and raised the funds needed to open the
medical school, and required Hopkins' officials to agree to their stipulation
that women would be admitted. Unfortunately, this stipulation applied only to
the medical school. Other graduate schools were opened to women by president
Ira Remsen only in 1907. Christine Ladd-Franklin was the first woman to earn a
PhD at Hopkins, in mathematics in 1882. The trustees denied her the degree and
refused to change the policy about admitting women; she finally received her
degree 44 years later. In 1893 Florence Bascomb became the university's first
female PhD. The nursing school opened in 1889 and accepted women and men as
students. The decision to admit women at undergraduate level was not considered
until the late 1960s and was eventually adopted in October 1969; in the fall of
1970, 90 females, five of them African-American, became undergraduates. In the
academic year 1970â€“1971, 4.7% of students in the Arts and Sciences programs
were women. In the year 1985â€“1986 the proportion of female students in the
Arts and Sciences programs had increased to around 38%. As of 2009â€“2010, the
undergraduate population was 47% female and 53% male. Campuses. Homewood. The
first campus was located on Howard Street. Eventually, they relocated to
Homewood, in northern Baltimore, the estate of Charles Carroll, son of the
oldest surviving signer of the Declaration of Independence. Carroll's Homewood
House is considered one of the finest examples of Federal residential
architecture. The estate then came to the Wyman family, which participated in
making it the park-like main campus of the schools of arts and sciences and
engineering at the start of the 20th century. Most of its architecture was
modeled after the Federal style of Homewood House. Homewood House is preserved
as a museum. Most undergraduate programs are here. East Baltimore. Collectively
known as Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions (JHMI) campus, the East Baltimore
facility occupies several city blocks spreading from the Johns Hopkins Hospital
trademark dome. Washington, D.C.. The Washington, D.C. campus is on
Massachusetts Avenue. Laurel, Maryland. The Applied Physics Laboratory, a
division of the university co-equal to the nine schools but with a non-academic
mission, lies between Baltimore and Washington in Laurel, Maryland. Other
campuses. International. In 2009, JHU ranked fifth among US universities in
private fundâ€“raising, collecting $433.39 million. The President is JHU's
chief executive officer, and the university is organized into nine academic
divisions. Campus environmental initiatives. Johns Hopkins University has
implemented a number of sustainability initiatives. In 2011, the "Sustainable
Endowments Institute" gave Johns Hopkins a College Sustainability Report Card
grade of "C+." In particular the Institute criticized JHU for failing to
disclose its endowment's holdings and proxy voting record on environmental
issues. Transportation. In 2007 carbon emissions were inventoried and electric
vehicles were used for some campus transportation needs. Food. As of 2007
dining services managers sought locallyâ€“sourced produce and seafood, and
integrated organic food into menus. In addition, the smaller cafÃ©s around
campus sell exclusively organic, shadeâ€“grown coffees. A small pilot
composting program operated on the undergraduate campus. Buildings. In 2007 the
university was pursuing LEED certification for several buildings. Energy
retrofits in certain buildings have resulted in over 50% less energy
consumption. Retrofits included a green roof, experimentation with waterless
urinals and low-flow shower heads, and upgraded fluorescent lighting that
reduced electricity for lighting on one campus by over 40 percent. Similar
lighting retrofits were underway at all campuses. At the beginning of 2012,
Hopkins sustainability announced the installation of 2,708 solar panels atop
buildings at Homewood (Rec/Athletic Center, Mattin Center), the Eastern
Building on 33rd Street and the East Baltimore Campus (Pinkard Building, 2024
Building, Bloomberg Building, Hampton House). These solar panels will produce
997,400 kWh and decrease 1,200,000Â lbs of greenhouse gases each year. Water.
In 2004, one campus completed a water conservation retrofit that annually saved
over of water. Student support. As of 2010 students contributed significantly
to environmental initiatives, setting up the JHU recycling program, hosting a
national "Greening" conference, launching a transportation shuttle service
between campuses and making the campus more bike-friendly. Each year, students
conduct the "S.E.X.:I.T." competition to see which dormitory can save the most
electricity. Organization. The Johns Hopkins entity is structured as two
corporations, the university and The Johns Hopkins Health System, formed in
1986. The latter has grown into the bigger entity, with fiscal year 2005
consolidated net revenue of $3.3 billion, employing 27,700 people, including
some 4,700 fullâ€“time physicians. JHU's bylaws specify a Board of Trustees of
between 18 and 65 voting members. Trustees serve sixâ€“year terms subject to a
twoâ€“term limit. The alumni select 12 trustees. Four recent alumni serve 4-
year terms, one per year, typically from the graduating class. The bylaws
prohibit students, faculty or administrative staff from serving on the Board,
except the President as an exâ€“officio trustee. The Johns Hopkins Health
System has a separate Board of Trustees, many of whom are doctors or health
care executives. Some JHU Trustees also serve on the Johns Hopkins Health
System Board. Academics. The full-time, four year undergraduate program is
"most selective" with low transfer-in and a high graduate co-existence. The
university is one of fourteen founding members of the Association of American
Universities (AAU); it is also a member of the Consortium on Financing Higher
Education (COFHE) and the Universities Research Association (URA).
Undergraduate admissions. In 2010, 87% of admitted students graduated in the
top tenth of their high school class and the inter-quartile range on the SAT
reading was 670â€“750, math was 690â€“780, and writing was 670â€“770. 97% of
freshmen returned after the first year, 84% of students graduated in 4 years
and 92% graduated in 6 years. Over time, applications to Johns Hopkins
University have risen steadily. As a result, the selectivity of Johns Hopkins
University has also increased. Early Decision is an option at Johns Hopkins
University for students who wish to demonstrate that the university is their
first choice. These students, if admitted, are required to enroll. This
application is due November 1. Most students, however, apply Regular Decision,
which is a traditional non-binding round. These applications are due January 1
and students are notified April 1. Rankings. At the undergraduate level,
Hopkins was ranked #13 among National Universities by "U.S. News and World
Report (USNWR)". It is ranked #1 in the nation in the high school counselor
reputation rankings. The 2012 "Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU)"
ranked Hopkins #17 internationally (#15 nationally) and 3rd in the world for
Clinical Medicine and Pharmacy. In 2010, Johns Hopkins ranked 13th in the Times
Higher Education World University Rankings and 16th in the 2011 QS World
University Rankings. Johns Hopkins also placed #2 in the 2010 University
Ranking by Academic Performance (URAP), #2 in the 2011 HEEACT â€“ Performance
Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities, ranked #7 among Top
Performing Schools according to the "Faculty Scholarly Productivity Index
(FSPI)" in 2008, and was listed #9 among research universities by the "Center
for Measuring University Performance" in 2007. For medical and public health
research "U.S. News and World Report" ranks the School of Medicine #2 and has
consistently ranked the Bloomberg School of Public Health #1 in the nation. The
School of Nursing was ranked #1 nationally among peer institutions. The "Times
Higher Education Supplement" ranked Johns Hopkins University #3 in the world
for biomedicine and life sciences. Hopkins ranks #1 nationally in receipt of
federal research funds and the School of Medicine is #1 among medical schools
in receipt of extramural awards from the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
Newsweek named Johns Hopkins as the "Hottest School for Pre-meds" in 2008. The
Johns Hopkins Hospital was ranked as the top hospital in the United States for
the eighteenth year in a row by the "U.S. News and World Report" annual ranking
of American hospitals. The university's graduate programs in the areas of
Biological & Biomedical Sciences, Engineering (Biomedical, Electrical &
Environmental), Human Development & Family Studies, Health Sciences,
Humanities, Physical & Mathematical Sciences and International Affairs &
Development all rank among the top-10 of their respective disciplines. The Paul
H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) ranked #1 (2005), #2
(2007), and #2 (2009), by College of William and Mary's surveys conducted once
every two years beginning in 2005, for its MA program among the world's top
schools of International Affairs for those who want to pursue a policy career.
The School of Education is ranked #6 nationally by "U.S. News and World
Report". Although no formal rankings exist for music conservatories, the
Peabody Institute is generally considered one of the most prestigious
conservatories in the country, along with Juilliard and the Curtis Institute.
Johns Hopkins is ranked the #1 Social Media College by StudentAdvisor. Several
university departments have been known to actively engage on various social
media platforms such as Blogs, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Flickr to reach
prospective students, current students, and alumni. Libraries. The Johns
Hopkins University Library system houses more than 3.6 million volumes. It
includes ten main divisions: the Sheridan Libraries at Homewood, the Welch
Medical Library, the Medical Institution Libraries, the School of Nursing
Library, Abraham M. Lilienfeld Library at the Bloomberg School, the Peabody
Institute Library, the Carey Business School and School of Education libraries,
the School of Advanced International Studies Libraries (Sydney R. and Elsa W.
Mason Library and Bologna Center Library), the R.E. Gibson Library at the
Applied Physics Laboratory Library and other minor satellite locations, as well
as the archives. The Milton S. Eisenhower Library, located on the Homewood
campus, is the main library. It was built in the 1960s. It houses over 2.6
million volumes and over 20,000 journal subscriptions. The Eisenhower Library
is a member of the university's Sheridan Libraries encompassing collections at
the Albert D. Hutzler Reading Room (called "The Hut" by students) in Gilman
Hall, the John Work Garrett Library at Evergreen House, and the George Peabody
Library at Mount Vernon Place. Together these collections provide the major
research library resources for the university, serving Johns Hopkins academic
programs worldwide. The library was named for Milton S. Eisenhower, former
president of the university and brother of former U.S. president Dwight D.
Eisenhower. JHU's library was previously housed in Gilman Hall, and other
smaller departmental libraries throughout the Homewood campus. Only two of the
Eisenhower library's six stories are above ground, though the architects
designed the building so that every level has windows and natural light. The
design accords with a bit of traditional campus lore that no structure can be
taller than Gilman Hall, the oldest academic building ( although no written
rule limits building height). In December 2008, an addition directly to the
south of the library was announced. The six-and-a-half-story expansion will be
named the Brody Learning Commons in honor of University President William R.
Brody and will function as a "â€¦collaborative learning space." It successfully
opened on August 13, 2012. Research. The opportunity to participate in
important research is one of the distinguishing characteristics of Hopkins'
undergraduate education. About 80 percent of undergraduates perform independent
research, often alongside top researchers. In FY 2009, Johns Hopkins received
$1.856 billion in federal research grantsâ€”more than any other US university.
Thirty-seven (37) Nobel Prize winners have been affiliated with the university
as alumni or faculty members. JHU views its academic strengths as being in art
history, biological, physical and other natural sciences, biomedical
engineering, creative writing, English, history, economics, international
studies, medicine, music, neuroscience, nursing, political theory, public
health, public policy, and the Romance languages. Between 1999 and 2009, Johns
Hopkins was among the most cited institutions in the world. It attracted nearly
1,222,166 citations and produced 54,022 papers under its name, ranking #3
globally behind Harvard University and Max Planck Society with the highest
total citations published in Thomson Reuters-indexed journals over 22 fields in
America. In FY 2000, Johns Hopkins received $95.4 million in research grants
from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), making it the
leading recipient of NASA research and development funding. In FY 2002, Hopkins
became the first university to cross the $1 billion threshold on either list,
recording $1.14 billion in total research and $1.023 billion in federally
sponsored research. In FY 2008, Johns Hopkins University performed $1.68
billion in science, medical and engineering research, making it the leading
U.S. academic institution in total R&D spending for the 30th year in a row,
according to a National Science Foundation (NSF) ranking. These totals include
grants and expenditures of JHU's Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel,
Maryland. The Johns Hopkins University also offers the "Center for Talented
Youth" programâ€”a nonprofit organization dedicated to identifying and
developing the talents of the most promising K-12 grade students worldwide. As
part of the Johns Hopkins University, the "Center for Talented Youth" or CTY
helps fulfill the university's mission of preparing students to make
significant future contributions to the world. Johns Hopkins University Press.
The Johns Hopkins University Press is the publishing division of the Johns
Hopkins University. It was founded in 1878 and holds the distinction of being
the oldest continuously running university press in the United States. To date
the Press has published more than 6,000 titles and currently publishes 65
scholarly periodicals and over 200 new books each year. Since 1993, the Johns
Hopkins University Press has run Project MUSE, an online collection of over 250
fullâ€“text, peerâ€“reviewed journals in the humanities and social sciences.
The Press also houses the Hopkins Fulfilment Services (HFS), which handles
distribution for a number of university presses and publishers. Taken together,
the three divisions of the Pressâ€”Books, Journals (including MUSE) and
HFSâ€”make it one of the largest of America's university presses. Student life.
The Johns Hopkins Student Government Association represents undergraduates in
campus issues and projects. It is elected annually. Blueprints for a new
programming board called The Hopkins Organization for Programming ("The HOP")
were drawn up during the summer and fall of 2006. In addition Charles Village,
the region of North Baltimore surrounding the university, has undergone several
restoration projects, and the university has gradually bought the property
around the school for additional student housing and dormitories. "The Charles
Village Project", scheduled for completion in 2008, brought new commercial
spaces to the neighborhood. The project included Charles Commons, a new, modern
residence hall that includes popular retail franchises. Hopkins invested in
improving campus life with an arts complex in 2001, the Mattin Center, and a
threeâ€“story sports facility, the O'Connor Recreation Center. The large
onâ€“campus dining facilities at Homewood were renovated in the summer of 2006.
Quality of life is enriched by the proximity of neighboring academic
institutions, including Loyola College, Maryland Institute College of Art
(MICA), UMBC, Goucher College, and Towson University, as well as nearby Inner
Harbor. Annually, the Johns Hopkins Spring Fair is held on the Homewood campus
over a three day weekend in mid-to-late April. Food, arts and crafts, and
nonâ€“profit vendors, along with a popular musical act and various other
activities attract nearly 25,000 people from the greater Baltimoreâ€“Washington
area. The Spring Fair is the largest entirely studentâ€“run fair in the
country. Since 1972, the Johns Hopkins Outdoors Club, or JHOC, has organized
weekend trips for students looking to experience the outdoors. Along with
Outdoor Pursuits, an arm of the University's Rec Center, JHOC offers students
the opportunity to participate in activities such as canoeing, kayaking,
caving, and mountain biking. Housing. Living on campus is required for first-
and second-year students, except for commuter students who live with a parent
or legal guardian. Housing is not guaranteed for juniors or seniors at Johns
Hopkins. Freshmen housing is centered around Freshman Quad, which consists of
three major residence hall complexes: The Alumni Memorial Residences (AMR I and
AMR II), Building A and Building B. AMR I was built in 1923 and includes Royce,
Sylvester, Vincent, Willard, Wilson and Wood houses; AMR II in 1954, holding
Adams, Baker, Clark, Gildersleeve, Griffin, Hollander, Jennings, Lazear houses.
The houses were named for Hopkins Alumni who died in World Wars I and II. While
each house has its own outside entrance, there are no dividers indoors that
distinguish them. In 1983, Buildings A and B were added to Freshmen Quad. They
have not yet been dedicated. Freshmen are also housed in Wolman Hall and the
terrace floor of McCoy Hall, located on the other side of North Charles Street.
Freshman enter a housing lottery in their spring semester to determine where
they will live during their sophomore year. Juniors and seniors may choose
between entering the campus housing lottery or moving into nearby apartments or
row houses. They occupy one of four buildings. The first, McCoy Hall, is
located next to Wolman Hall on North Charles Street. McCoy Hall is
predominantly composed of sophomores and transfer students. Apartment-style
housing is offered in the Bradford Apartments, one block east of campus on St.
Paul Street, and in the Homewood Apartments, two blocks south on North Charles
Street. The last is Charles Commons, the newest and largest universityâ€“owned
dormitory, located at the corner of North Charles and East 33rd. It was
completed in 2006 to house 618 students and represented a major step by the
university towards offering onâ€“campus housing to students. Charles Commons
consists of two 11â€“story towers connected by a bridge, residential suites and
features a ballroom, fitness center and several conference rooms. Nolan's on
33rd, a dining hall specializing in dinner services, is also located in the
building. JHU rents several buildings on North Charles Street to house students
when necessary. At full capacity, dormitory buildings can house approximately
60% of undergraduates. Privatelyâ€“owned apartment buildings around Homewood
are usually filled with Hopkins upperclassmen, so despite the lack of
universityâ€“owned dormitories, housing is available. Fraternities and
sororities. The University Office of Greek Life recognizes thirteen
fraternities and eight sororities, which include approximately 25% of the
student body. Greek life has been a part of the university culture since 1877,
when Beta Theta Pi fraternity became the first to form a chapter on campus.
Sororities arrived at Hopkins in 1982. As with all Hopkins programs, Greek
discrimination on the basis of "marital status, pregnancy, race, color,
ethnicity, national origin, age, disability, religion, sexual orientation,
veteran status" is prohibited. JHU also has an antiâ€“hazing policy and
prohibits alcohol at recruitment activities. Hopkins does not permit
"cityâ€“wide" chapters, and requires all members of a JHU recognized fraternity
or sorority to be a JHU student. As of spring 2011, 1,208 students were members
of one of Hopkins' fraternities or sororities. The Allâ€“Greek Average GPA was
3.31, above the undergraduate average GPA. In spring 2010 the university was
considering construction of a "fraternity row" of houses to consolidate the
groups on campus. All Johns Hopkins fraternities and sororities belong to one
of four Councils: the Interâ€“Fraternity Council, the National Panhellenic
Conference, the National Pan-Hellenic Council and the Multicultural Council.
Delta Phi Fraternity, also known as St. Elmo's, maintains a chapter exclusive
to students at Johns Hopkins, though it is not recognized by the Office of
Greek Life. Unrecognized Alpha Kappa Alpha and Delta Sigma Theta
Africanâ€“American interest sororities often recruit Johns Hopkins
undergraduates, in their cityâ€“wide chapters. Delta Sigma Theta was the first
National Panâ€“Hellenic Council member to charter on the campus in 1976, as
well as the first sorority of any kind on the JHU campus. Kappa Alpha Theta, a
National Panhellenic Conference (NPC) sorority, was disbanded by its national
headquarters on April 14, 2009 after twelve years on campus. The removal was
due to repeated risk management violations. In March 2010, Johns Hopkins
University officially opened for NPC extension. In May 2010, the University
Panhellenic Council selected Pi Beta Phi, which opened in the fall of 2010.
Recruitment for Interâ€“Fraternity Council and Panhellenic Conference
fraternities and sororities takes place during the spring semester for
freshmen, though some groups recruit upperclassmen during the fall semester.
All participants must have completed one semester and must be in good academic
standing. Many of the fraternities maintain houses off campus, but no
sororities do. Baltimore City allows housing to be zoned specifically for use
as a fraternity or sorority house, but in practice this zoning code has not
been awarded for at least 50 years. Only Sigma Phi Epsilon's building has this
zoning code due to its consistent ownership since the 1920s. Student
publications. Hopkins has many student publications. Athletics. Athletic teams
are called Blue Jays. Even though sable and gold are used for academic robes,
the university's athletic colors are Columbia blue (PMS 284) and black. Hopkins
celebrates Homecoming in the spring to coincide with the height of the lacrosse
season. The Men's and Women's lacrosse teams are in National Collegiate
Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I. Other teams are in Division III and
participate in the Centennial Conference. JHU is also home to the Lacrosse
Museum and National Hall of Fame, maintained by US Lacrosse. Men's lacrosse.
The school's most prominent team is its men's lacrosse team. The team does not
