State of emergency A state of emergency is a governmental declaration that may
suspend some normal functions of the executive, legislative and judicial
powers, alert citizens to change their normal behaviors, or order government
agencies to implement emergency preparedness plans. It can also be used as a
rationale for suspending rights and freedoms, even if guaranteed under the
constitution. Such declarations usually come during a time of natural or man
made disaster, during periods of civil unrest, or following a declaration of
war or situation of international or internal armed conflict. "Justitium" is
its equivalent in Roman law. In some countries, the state of emergency and its
effects on human rights and freedoms and governmental procedure are regulated
by the constitution and/or a law that limits the powers that may be invoked.
Rights and freedoms may be suspended during an emergency, for instance, freedom
of movement, but not non-derogable rights. In many countries it is illegal to
modify the emergency law or the constitution during the emergency. Use and
viewpoints. Though fairly uncommon in democracies, dictatorial regimes often
declare a state of emergency that is prolonged indefinitely for the life of the
regime. In some situations, martial law is also declared, allowing the military
greater authority to act. In other situations, emergency is not declared and de
facto measures taken or decree-law adopted by the government. Ms. Nicole
Questiaux (France) and Mr. Leandro Despouy (Argentina), two consecutive United
Nations Special Rapporteurs have recommended to the international community to
adopt the following "principles" to be observed during a state or de facto
situation of emergency : Principles of Legality, Proclamation, Notification,
Time Limitation, Exceptional Threat, Proportionality, Non-Discrimination,
Compatibility, Concordance and Complementarity of the Various Norms of
International Law . (cf: "Question of Human Rights and State of Emergency", E/
CN.4/Sub.2/1997/19, at Chapter II; see also √©tat d'exception ) Article 4 to
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), permits
states to derogate from certain rights guaranteed by the ICCPR in "time of
public emergency". Any measures derogating from obligations under the Covenant,
however, must only be to the extent required by the exigencies of the
situation, and must be announced by the State Party to the Secretary-General of
the United Nations. The European and American Conventions on Human Rights have
similar derogatory provisions. No derogation is permitted to the International
Labour Conventions. Some political theorists, such as Carl Schmitt, have argued
that the power to decide the initiation of the state of emergency defines
sovereignty itself. In "State of Exception" (2005), Giorgio Agamben criticized
this idea, arguing that the mechanism of the state of emergency deprives
certain people of their civil and political rights, producing his
interpretation of "homo sacer". Abuse. The state of emergency can be abused by
being invoked, for example, to allow a state to suppress internal opposition
without having to respect human rights. An example was the August 1991
attempted coup in the Soviet Union (USSR) where the coup leaders invoked a
state of emergency; the failure of the coup led to the dissolution of the
Soviet Union. Derogations by states having ratified or acceeded to binding
international agreements such as the ICCPR, the American and European
Conventions on Human Rights and the International Labour Conventions are
monitored by independent expert committees, regional Courts and other State
Parties. State-of-emergency law in selected countries. Argentina. The
Constitution, which has been amended several times, has always allowed for a
state of emergency (literally "estado de sitio", "state of siege"), to be
declared if the constitution or the authorities it creates are endangered by
internal unrest or foreign attack. This provision was much abused during
dictatorships, with long-lasting states of siege giving the government a free
hand to suppress opposition ( state of emergencies had been declared 52 times
by democratic and dictatorial governments, starting in 1854 shortly after the
constitution came into force). The American Convention on Human Rights (Pacto
de San Jos√© de Costa Rica), adopted in 1969 but only ratified by Argentina in
1984 immediately after the end of the National Reorganization Process,
restricts abuse of the state of emergency by requiring any signatory nation
declaring such a state to inform the other signatories of its circumstances and
duration, and what rights are affected. Australia. State-of-emergency
legislation differs in each state of Australia. In Victoria, the premier can
declare a state of emergency if there is a threat to employment, safety or
public order. The declaration expires after 30 days, and a resolution of either
the upper or lower House of Parliament may revoke it earlier. Under the Public
Safety Preservation Act, a declared state of emergency allows the premier to
immediately make any desired regulations to secure public order and safety.
However, these regulations expire if Parliament does not agree to continue them
within 7 days. Also, under the Essential Services Act, the premier (or
delegate) may operate or prohibit operation of, as desired, any essential
service (e.g., transport, fuel, power, water, gas). In regards to Emergency
Management, area's which have been affected by a natural disaster are the
responsibility of the state, until that state declares a State of Emergency
where access to Federal Emergency Fund becomes available to help respond and
recover from natural disasters. Although a State of Emergency doesn't apply to
the whole state, but rather districts or shires, where essential services may
have been disrupted. Canada. The federal government of Canada can use the
Emergencies Act to invoke a state of emergency. A national state of emergency
automatically expires after 90 days, unless extended by the Governor-in-
Council. There are different levels of emergencies: Public Welfare Emergency,
Public Order Emergency, International Emergency, and War Emergency. The
Emergencies Act replaced the War Measures Act in 1988. The War Measures Act was
invoked three times in Canadian history, most controversially during the FLQ
Crisis. During World War I (against threat of Communism from 1914 to 1920) and
World War II (perceived threat by Japanese Canadians after Pearl Harbor from
1942 to 1945) the Act was enacted for the duration of both of the two world
wars. Under the current Emergency Act a state of emergency can also be declared
by provincial, territorial, and municipal governments. Since Canada's federal
government and any of its provincial governments can suspend for five years at
a time the Charter rights to fundamental freedoms in section 2, to legal rights
in sections 7 through 14, and to equality rights in section 15 by a simple
majority vote of the legislature which invokes the Charter of Rights and
Freedoms' override clause, section 33, emergency powers can always be very
easily created even without using the Emergency Act. Denmark. The police chief
in a district can impose a zone in which people can be body searched without a
specific suspicion. Such an order must be issued in writing, published, and
imposed for a limited period. The police law (article 6) regulates this area.
The normal procedure calls for assisting the suspect to a private area and
stripping them. If the police feel that a situation involving a crowd of people
can get out of hand, they can call for mass arrest of all people in an area and
detain them for six hours without charging them. This is called a precluding
arrest. Egypt. Egyptians lived under an Emergency Law (Law No. 162 of 1958)
from 1967 to 2012, except for an 18-month break in 1980. The emergency was
imposed during the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, and reimposed following the
assassination of President Anwar Sadat. The law continuously extended every
three years since 1981. Under the law, police powers were extended,
constitutional rights suspended and censorship was legalized. The law sharply
circumscribed any non-governmental political activity: street demonstrations,
non-approved political organizations, and unregistered financial donations were
formally banned. Some 17,000 people were detained under the law, and estimates
of political prisoners run as high as 30,000. The emergency rule expired on May
31, 2012. France. Three main dispositions concern various kind of "state of
emergency" in France: article 16 of the Constitution of 1958 allows, in time of
crisis, "extraordinary powers" to the president. Article 36 of the same
constitution regulates "state of siege" ("√©tat de si√®ge"). Finally, the April
3, 1955 Act allows the proclamation, by the Council of Ministers, of the "state
of emergency" ("√©tat d'urgence"). The distinction between article 16 and the
1955 Act concerns mainly the distribution of powers: whereas in article 16, the
executive power basically suspend the regular procedures of the Republic, the
1955 Act permits a twelve-day state of emergency, after which a new law
extending the emergency must be voted by the Parliament. These dispositions
have been used at various times, in 1955, 1958, 1961, 1988 and 2005 (see
below). The state of emergency in France is framed by the Constitution of 1958,
which states that it can be decreed by the "Pr√©sident de la r√©publique" in
the Council of Ministers, but must be confirmed by Parliament in order to be
held after 12 days. It may also give the military authority the power to act in
place of civilian authorities, if a decree specifies it explicitly. It is
unclear, however, how some of the legal possibilities can be implemented due to
various legal changes since the 1950s. The conditions are both that the state
is confronted to exceptional circumstances and that the regular institutions
are disrupted and cannot effectively govern. This amendment to the Constitution
of the Fifth Republic has been qualified as "liberticide" by critics. Invoked
on 23 April 1961 during the Algerian War; normal functioning of institutions
was quickly restored. In the judgment Rubin de Servens of March 2, 1962, the
"Conseil d'√âtat" judged that he could not himself invoke article 16, as that
constituted an "act of government". Furthermore, the State Council considered
that it could only pronounce on rulings which were not legislative acts carried
out during this period. Thus, a legislative measure (although the role of
Parliament is not specified, just that it is not to be dissolved) which
breaches fundamental liberties cannot be appealed against before the "Conseil
d'√âtat". Article 36 of the Constitution is concerned with the state of siege
(in French), which can be decreed by the Council of Ministers for a period of
twelve days which can only be extended with the approval of the Parliament. A
state of siege may be declared in case of an "imminent peril resulting from a
foreign war ["guerre √©trang√®re", or simply "war"] or an armed insurrection
("une insurrection √  main arm√©e"). Military authorities may take police
powers if they judge it necessary. Fundamental liberties may be restricted,
such as the right of association, legalization of searches in private places
day and night, the power to expel people who have been condemned for common law
matters or people who do not have the right of residence in the territory, etc.
In 1972 the Common Program of the Left (issued from an alliance between the
Socialist Party and the Communist Party) proposed to repeal article 16.
Fran√ßois Mitterrand's program in 1981 did not include this proposition. The
Socialist government of Pierre B√©r√©govoy included a reform of this article in
its project of Constitutional reform in 1992, but the project was not
implemented. Also in 1992, the Vedel Commission created by Fran√ßois Mitterrand
proposed to give to the "Conseil Constitutionnel" (Constitutional Council), on
the concerted initiative of the President of the Republic and the presidents of
the Assemblies, the mission to determine that the conditions required for the
use of article 16 were in fact met. On July 23, 2008 a constitutional act was
passed which, among other amendments, added a paragraph to article 16 of the
Constitution which stated that after 30 days the Constitutional Council can be
requested to determine whether the conditions that justified the use of article
16 are still current; the ruling is public. At any time beyond 60 days the
Council rules on this issue without the need for a referral. Germany. The
Weimar Republic constitution allowed states of emergency under Article 48 to
deal with rebellions. Article 48 was often invoked during the 14-year life of
the Republic, sometimes for no reason other than to allow the government to act
when it was unable to obtain a parliamentary majority. After the February 27,
1933 Reichstag fire, an attack blamed on the communists, Adolf Hitler declared
a state of emergency using Article 48, and then had President von Hindenburg
sign the Reichstag Fire Decree, which suspended the Weimar Constitution for the
whole duration of the Third Reich: the Weimar Constitution was never actually
repealed by Nazi Germany, but "indefinitely suspended". After the prohibition
of the Communist Party of Germany on March 1, 1933, the Nazi Party were to free
to vote in the March 23, 1933 Enabling Act, which enabled Chancellor Adolf
Hitler and his cabinet to enact laws without the participation of the
Reichstag. These two laws implemented the "Gleichschaltung", the Nazis'
institution of totalitarianism. In the postwar Federal Republic of Germany the
"Emergency Acts" state that some of the basic constitutional rights of the
Basic Law may be limited in case of a state of defence, a state of tension, or
an internal state of emergency or disaster (catastrophe). These amendments to
the constitution were passed on May 30, 1968 despite fierce opposition by the
so-called "extraparliamentary opposition" (see German student movement for
details). Hong Kong. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress
can declare a state of emergency and deploy troops from the People's Liberation
Army Hong Kong Garrison under the Law of the People's Republic of China on the
garrisoning of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The Chief Executive
of Hong Kong along with the Executive Council can prohibit public gatherings,
issue curfew orders, prohibit the movement of vessels or aircraft and appoint
special constable all under Chapter 245 ("Public Order Ordinance") of Hong Kong
Law. Hungary. According to the Hungarian Constitution, the National Assembly of
Hungary can declare state of emergency in case of armed rebellion or natural or
industrial disaster. It expires after 30 days, but can be extended. Most civil
rights can be suspended, but basic human rights (such as the right to live, the
ban of torture, and freedom of religion) cannot. During state of emergency, the
Parliament cannot be disbanded. India. In 1975, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi
declared a state of internal emergency after she was indicted in a corruption
scandal and ordered to vacate her seat in the Indian Parliament, allowing
herself to rule by decree until 1977. It all started after maverick socialist
Raj Narain, who had been defeated in parliamentary election by Indira Gandhi,
lodged cases of election fraud and use of state machinery for election purposes
against Mrs. Indira Gandhi in the Allahabad High Court. On 12 June 1975,
Justice Jagmohanlal Sinha of the Allahabad High Court found the Prime Minister
guilty on the charge of misuse of government machinery for her election
campaign. The court declared her election null and void and unseated her from
her seat in the Lok Sabha. The court also banned her from contesting any
election for an additional six years. Some serious charges such as bribing
voters and election malpractices were dropped and she was held responsible for
misusing the government machinery, and found guilty on charges such as using
the state police to build a dais, availing the services of a government
officer, Yashpal Kapoor (IAS), during the elections before he had resigned from
his position, and use of electricity from the state electricity department.
Protests led by J.P.Narayan, Raj Narain, Satyendra Narayan Sinha and Morarji
Desai flooded the streets of Delhi close to the Parliament building and the
Prime Minister's residence.The persistent efforts of Raj Narain, was praised
worldwide as it took him over four years of continuous political and legal
battle against system and Mrs Indira Gandhi to prove his charges. This
instilled the faith in Indian Democracy and Judiciary. Political opposition was
heavily suppressed during the emergency. Civil liberties were suspended and a
mandatory birth control program was introduced by the government. The
Government used police forces across the country to arrest thousands of
protestors and strike leaders. J.P. Narayan, Raj Narain, Morarji Desai, Charan
Singh, Jivatram Kripalani, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, L.K. Advani, Satyendra Narayan
Sinha and other protest leaders were immediately arrested. Organizations such
as the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, along with some opposition political
parties were banned. Nearly two years later, confident about her chances of
getting re-elected, Indira Gandhi relaxed the emergency and released
dissidents. Mrs. Gandhi called new elections and freed her critics, Mr.Raj
Narain and his colleagues rode a popular wave of unrest to defeat her and her
Government. Raj Narain won decisively in the Prime Minister's home constituency
of Rae Bareli. The victory of Mr Raj Narain over Prime Minister Smt. Indira
Gandhi in 1977 parliamentary elections in Rai Bareilly (U.P-India) led to the
fall of long era of Congress led central government in India, after
independence and brought everlasting change in political equations thereafter
in Indian politics, even today. Ireland. According to Article 28.3.3. of the
Constitution of Ireland, "no article of the Constitution may be invoked to
invalidate any law enacted by the Oireachtas which is expressed to be for the
purpose of securing the public safety and the preservation of the State in time
of war or armed rebellion, or to nullify any act done or purporting to be done
in time of war or armed rebellion in pursuance of any such law". The time of
war or armed rebellion includes actions outside the state itself, and is not
limited in time to the duration of the war or armed rebellion. A state of
emergency was declared in 1939 at the outbreak of World War II, though Ireland
was not a participant (The period was and is referred to as The Emergency in
Ireland). This state of emergency was not technically lifted until 1972, and
was succeeded by a second state of emergency to deal with the Troubles in
Northern Ireland, which lasted until the IRA ceasefire in 1994. Macau. The
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress can declare a state of
emergency and deploy troops from the People's Liberation Army Macau Garrison
under the Article 14 of Macau's Basic Law on the defence of the Macau Special
Administrative Region. The Chief Executive of Macau can use the Macau national
security law to prohibit public gatherings, issue curfew orders, prohibit other
activities perceived to be a threat against the Region or China. Malaysia. In
Malaysia, if the Yang di-Pertuan Agong is satisfied that a grave emergency
exists whereby the security, or the economic life, or public order in the
Federation or any part thereof is threatened, he may issue a Proclamation of
Emergency making therein a declaration to that effect. In the history of
Malaysia, a state of emergency was declared by the then-colonial government of
Britain. The state of emergency lasted from 1948 until 1960 to deal with the
communists led by Chin Peng. States of emergency were also declared during the
Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation in 1962, the 1966 Sarawak constitutional
crisis and 1977 Kelantan Emergency. When a race riot broke out on May 13, 1969,
a state of emergency was declared. Thiery Rommel, the European Commission's
envoy to Malaysia, told Reuters by telephone on November 13, 2007 (the last day
of his mission) that, "Today, this country still lives under (a state of)
emergency." Although not officially proclaimed as a state of emergency, the
Emergency Ordinance and the Internal Security Act had allowed detention for
years without trial. New Zealand. The Civil Defence Emergency Management Act
2002 gives the government and local city council the power to issue a state of
emergency, either over the entire country or within a specific region. This may
suspend ordinary work and essential services if need be. The state of emergency
in New Zealand expires on the commencement of the seventh day after the date on
which it was declared, unless it is extended. However, the minister of civil
defence or local mayor may lift the state of emergency after an initial review
of the region's status. Nigeria. In Nigeria, a state of emergency is usually
declared in times of great civil unrest. On 31 December 2011, the Nigerian
President declared a state of emergency in the North-Eastern (Yobe and Borno
States) and North-Central (Plateau and Niger State) regions of the country.
This declaration also included the immediate shutdown of the borders in that
region. This declaration was in reaction to the terrorist attacks on Nigerians
by an Islamic extremist sect called Boko Haram. Boko Haram wants to impose
strict Sharia law across Nigeria. Pakistan. The first three were regarded as
the imposition of direct martial law. In 2007 a 'state of emergency' was
declared. Romania. In Romania, there are two types of states of emergency, each
designed for a different type of situation. The most famous event in which the
state of emergency has been enforced was because of 1977 Vrancea earthquake.
Spain. In Spain, there are three degrees of state of emergency ("estado de
emergencia" in Spanish): "alarma" (alarm or alert), "excepci√≥n"
(exceptioncircumstance) and "sitio" (siege). They are named by the
constitution, which limits which rights may be suspended, but regulated by the
"Ley Org√°nica 4/1981" (Organic Law). On December 4, 2010, the first state of
alert was declared following the air traffic controllers strike. It was the
first time since the Francisco Franco's regime that a state of emergency was
declared. Trinidad and Tobago. The Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar on 21
August 2011 at 8:00¬ pm announced a State of Emergency in an attempt to crack
down on the trafficking of illegal drugs and firearms, in addition to gangs.
The decision of the President, George Maxwell Richards, to issue the
proclamation for the State of Emergency was debated in the country's Parliament
as required by the Constitution on September 2, 2011 and passed by the required
simple majority of the House of Representatives. Debate on a 3-month first
extension of the State of Emergency is in progress before the Parliament on
September 3. On September 4 the Parliament has extended the State Of Emergency
for a further 3 months. The last time a State of emergency was declared was in
1970 Black Power Revolution & July 27 - August 1, 1990 in the attempted state
coup by the Jamaat al Muslimeen against the NAR government of the then Prime
Minister A. N. R. Robinson. Turkey. Since the foundation of the Republic of
Turkey in 1923 the military conducted three coup d'√©tats and announced martial
law. Martial law between 1978 and 1983 was replaced by a state of emergency
that lasted until November 2002. United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom, the
Monarch, the Privy Council, or the Prime Minister can make emergency
regulations under the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 if there is a serious threat
to human welfare, the environment, or in case of war or terrorism. These
regulations last for seven days unless confirmed otherwise by Parliament. A
state of emergency was last invoked in 1974 by Prime Minister Edward Heath in
response to increasing industrial action. United States. In the United States,
there are several methods for government response to emergency situations. A
state governor or local mayor may declare a state of emergency within his or
her jurisdiction. This is common at the state level in response to natural
disasters. The president of the United States, as head of the executive branch,
has the authority to declare a federal state of emergency. The only emergency
provisions in the U.S. Constitution are: "The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas
Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion
the public Safety may require it." and an exemption from the privilege of a
grand jury hearing for cases arising in the military when in service in a time
of "public danger". Habeas corpus was suspended on April 27, 1861 during the
American Civil War by Abraham Lincoln in parts of Maryland and some midwestern
states, including southern Indiana. He did so in response to demands by
generals to set up military courts to rein in "copperheads", those in the Union
who supported the Confederate cause. Lambdin P. Milligan and four others were
accused of planning to steal Union weapons and invade Union prisoner-of-war
camps, and were sentenced to hang by a military court in 1864. However, their
execution was not set until May 1865, so they were able to argue the case after
the Civil War. It was decided in the Supreme Court case "Ex parte Milligan" 71
US 2 1866 that the suspension was unconstitutional because civilian courts were
still operating, and the Constitution only provided for suspension of habeas
corpus if these courts are actually forced closed. On December 16, 1950, during
the Korean War, President Truman issued Presidential Proclamation No. 2914,
declaring a state of national emergency. The Supreme Court ruling in
"Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer" established, in 1952, that presidents
may not act contrary to Acts of Congress during an emergency. During the
Watergate scandal which erupted in the 1970s after President Richard Nixon
authorized a variety of illegal acts, Congress investigated the extent of the
President's powers and belatedly realized that the U.S. had been in a
continuous state of emergency since 1950. As a result, in 1976 the National
Emergencies Act set a limit of two years on emergency declarations unless the
president explicitly extends them, and requiring the president to specify in
advance which legal provisions will be invoked. The Act terminated the
emergency of 1950 on September 14, 1978; however, even in the 21st century, the
federal courts have upheld harsh penalties (including deportation) for crimes
that occurred during the state of national emergency from 1950 to 1978, where
the penalties were escalated because of the existence of that emergency. The
1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act allows freezing of assets,
limiting of trade, and confiscation of property during a declared emergency. A
federal emergency declaration allows the United States Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) to exercise its power to deal with emergency
situations; federal assistance also becomes available to areas that are
declared to be in a state of emergency. For FEMA, emergency declarations are
different from the more common disaster declarations done for hurricanes and
floods. Typically, a state of emergency empowers the executive to name
coordinating officials to deal with the emergency and to override normal
administrative processes regarding the passage of administrative rules. The
United States is formally in an ongoing limited state of emergency declared by
several Presidents for several reasons. A state of emergency began on January
24, 1995 with the signing of Executive Order 12947 by President Bill Clinton.
In accordance with the National Emergencies Act, the executive order's actual
effect was not a declaration of a general emergency, but a limited embargo on
trade with "Terrorists Who Threaten To Disrupt the Middle East Peace Process".
This "national emergency" was expanded in 1998 to include additional targets
such as Osama bin Laden, and has been continued to at least 2008 by order of
President George W. Bush. There are a number of other ongoing national
emergencies of this type, regarding for instance diamond trade with Sierra
Leone. Especially noteworthy are the ongoing states of emergency declared on
November 14, 1979 regarding the Iran hostage crisis, that declared on March 15,
1995 with respect to Iran, and that declared on September 14, 2001 through
Bush's Proclamation 7463, regarding the September 11 attacks. President Barack
Obama extended George Bush's Declaration of Emergency regarding terrorism on
September 10, 2009, on September 10, 2010, on September 9, 2011, and on
September 11, 2012. In October 2012, 8 states on the East Cost declared a State
of Emergency in response to Hurricane Sandy.
