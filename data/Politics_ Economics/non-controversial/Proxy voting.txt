Proxy voting Proxy voting is a form of voting whereby some members of a
decision-making body may delegate their voting power to other members of the
same body to vote in their absence, and/or to select additional
representatives. A person so designated is called a "proxy" and the person
designating him or her is called a "principal". Proxy appointments can be used
to form a voting bloc that can exercise greater influence in deliberations or
negotiations. The parliamentary manual "Riddick's Rules of Procedure" notes
that, under proxy voting, voting for officers should be done by ballot, due to
the difficulties involved in authentication if a member simply calls out, "I
cast 17 votes for Mr. X." An International Journal of Humanities and Social
Sciences paper noted that proxy voting might be particularly useful in
situations in which votes are cast as the discussion is ongoing (rather than at
the end of a period of discussion). Proxy voting is also an important feature
in corporate governance through the proxy statement. Legislatures. The rules of
some assemblies presently forbid proxy voting. For example, in both houses of
the U.S. Congress, as well as in most if not all state legislatures, each
member must be present and cast his own vote for that vote to be counted. This
can result, however, in the absence of a quorum and the need to compel
attendance by a sufficient number of missing members to get a quorum. See "call
of the house". Various proposals have been made for a kind of automatic proxy
voting in legislatures. For example, it has been proposed that instead of
electing members from single-member districts (that may have been
gerrymandered), members be elected at large, but when seated each member cast
the number of votes he or she received in the last election. Thus, if, for
example, a state were allocated 32 members in the U.S. House of
Representatives, the 32 candidates who received the most votes in the at-large
election would be seated, but each would cast a different number of votes on
the floor and in committee. This proposal would allow for representation of
minority views in legislative deliberations, as it does in deliberations at
shareholder meetings of corporations. The Parliament of New Zealand allows
proxy voting. Sections 155-156 of the Standing Orders of the New Zealand House
of Representatives specify the procedures for doing so. A member can designate
another member or a party to cast his vote. However, a party may not exercise
proxies for more than 25% of its members (rounded upwards). The "New Zealand
Listener" notes a controversial occurrence of proxy voting. The Labour Party
was allowed to cast votes on behalf of Taito Phillip Field, who was frequently
absent. Theoretically, this was to be allowed only if a legislator was absent
on parliamentary business, public business or pressing private business, such
as illness or bereavement. Until the Republican reforms of 1995 banished the
practice, proxy voting was also used in U.S. House of Representatives
committees. Often members would delegate their vote to the ranking member of
their party in the committee. Republicans opposed proxy voting on the grounds
that it allowed an indolent Democratic majority to move legislation through
committee with antimajoritarian procedures. That is, the Democratic leader in
the committee would successfully oppose the sitting Republican majority by
wielding the proxies of absent Democrats. Thomas E. Mann and Norman J. Ornstein
write, "In a large and fragmented institution in which every member has five or
six places to be at any given moment, proxy voting is a necessary evil".
Elections. Proxy voting is sometimes described as "the frequency with which
spouses, union workers, and friends of friends are in effect sent off to the
polls with an assignment to complete." The potential for proxy voting exists in
roughly one voter out of five, and it is about twice as high at the middle
levels of the sophistication continuum. According to W. Russell Neuman, the net
effect of the cues provided by friends and associates is not likely to be as
significant as those of the political parties. The possibility of expanded use
of proxy voting has been the subject of much speculation. Terry F. Buss et al.
write that internet voting would result in de facto approval of proxy voting,
since passwords could be shared with others: "Obviously, cost-benefit
calculations around the act of voting could also change substantially as
organizations attempt to identify and provide inducements to control proxy
votes without violating vote-buying prohibitions in the law." One of the
criticisms of proxy voting is that it carries a risk of fraud or intimidation.
Another criticism is that it violates the concept of a secret ballot, in that
paperwork may be filed, for instance, designating a party worker as one's
proxy. It has been proposed that proxy voting be combined with initiative and
referendum to form a hybrid of direct democracy and representative democracy.
James C. Miller III, Ronald Reagan's budget director, suggested scrapping
representative democracy and instead implementing a "program for direct and
proxy voting in the legislative process." It has been suggested by Joseph
Francis Zimmerman that proxy voting be allowed in New England town meetings.
Proxy voting can eliminate some of the problems associated with the public
choice dilemma of bundling. Albania. According to Arch Puddington et al., in
Albanian Muslim areas, many women have been effectively disenfranchised through
proxy voting by male relatives. Algeria. In Algeria, restrictions on proxy
voting were instituted circa 1991 in order to undermine the Islamic Salvation
Front. Canada. In Canada, the province of Nova Scotia allows citizens to vote
by proxy if they expect to be absent. The Territories of Yukon, Northwest
Territories, and Nunavut also allow for proxy voting. Canadian prisoners of war
in enemy camps were allowed to vote through proxy voting. David Stewart and
Keith Archer opine that proxy voting can result in leadership selection
processes to become leader-dominated. Proxy voting had only been available to
military personnel since World War II, but was extended in 1970 and 1977 to
include voters in special circumstances such as northern camp operators,
fishermen, and prospectors. The Alberta Liberal Party ran into some
difficulties, in that an unknown number of proxy ballots that were counted may
have been invalid. Those who, through proxy voting or assistance of invalids,
become knowledgeable of the principal's choice are bound to secrecy. China.
Some Chinese provinces allow village residents to designate someone to vote on
their behalf. Lily L. Tsai notes that "In practice, one family member often
casts votes for everyone in the family even if they are present for the
election. In 1997, a Carter Center delegation recommended abolishing the proxy
voting that allowed one person to vote for three; the International Republican
Institute had made a similar recommendation. Proxy voting also became an issue
in relation to many of the Wenzhou people doing business outside. Most election
disputes revolved around proxy votes, including the issues of who could
represent them to vote and what kinds of evidence were acceptable for proxy
voting. Intense competition made the proxy voting process more and more formal
and transparent. Some villages required a notary to validate faxed proxy votes;
some villages asked for faxed signatures; more often villages publicized those
proxy votes so that villagers could directly monitor them. Taicang government
reported a 99.4% voter turnout in its 1997 election, but a study showed that
after removing proxy votes, only 48% of the eligible voters in the sample
reported that they actually went to the central polling station to vote. Gabon.
According to Mim Kelber, "in Central Africa, all it takes for a man to cast a
proxy vote for his wife is to produce an unwitnessed letter mentioning the name
of the person to whom the voting power is delegated." The Gabon respondent to
an Inter-Parliamentary Union letter commented, "It has been observed that this
possibility was exploited to a far greater extent by men than by women, for
reasons not always noble." Guyana. Proxy voting played an important role in
Guyana politics in the 1960s. Prior to and during the 1961 elections, proxies
had been severely restricted. Some restrictions were lifted, and there was a
rise in proxy votes cast from 300 in 1961 to 6,635 in 1964. After that
election, the Commonwealth Team of Observers voiced concern about proxy votes
being liable to fraud. The proxy voting rules were relaxed further, and in
1969, official figures recorded 19,287 votes cast by proxy, about 7% of the
total votes cast (an increase from 2.5% in 1964 to 1968). Amidst allegations of
fraud, more restrictions were placed on proxy voting in 1973; in that year,
about 10,000 votes were cast by proxy. India. In 2003, India's People's
Representative Act was amended to allow armed forces personnel to appoint a
proxy to vote on their behalf. Iraq. In Iraq, the Electoral Laws of 1924 and
1946 ruled out the possibility of proxy voting, except for illiterates, who
could appoint someone to write for them. Russia. Some instances of proxy voting
(usually by family members) in the Russian parliamentary elections of 1995 were
noted by observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe. United Kingdom. The provision for proxy voting in the UK dates back to
James I. Long before women's suffrage, women sometimes voted as proxies for
absent male family heads. Under British electoral law, ballot papers could not
be sent overseas. British expatriates had no right to vote until the mid-1980s.
They can now vote by proxy in general elections if they have been on a British
electoral register at some point in the past 15 years. They can also vote by
post.[http://www.aboutmyvote.co.uk/register_to_vote/
british_citizens_living_abroad.aspx] In the United Kingdom, electors may
appoint a proxy. An elector can only act as a proxy for two people to whom they
are not directly related. However, they can be a proxy for any number of
electors if they are directly related to those electors. The voter can change
his mind and vote in the election personally as long as his proxy has not
already voted on his behalf or applied to vote by mail. Voters must provide a
reason for using a proxy, such as being away on vacation. A narrower subset of
reasons is permissible if the proxy is to be for more than one election. Except
in cases of blindness, the validity of all proxies must be certified by someone
such as an employer or doctor. In 2004, two Liberal Democrat councillors were
found guilty of submitting 55 fraudulent proxy votes and sentenced to 18 months
imprisonment. The Electoral Reform Society has proposed the abolition of proxy
voting in the UK United States. In 1635-36, Massachusetts granted to the
frontier towns "liberty to stay soe many of their freemen at home for the
safety of their towne as they judge needful, and that the said freemen that are
appoyncted by the towne to stay at home shall have liberty for this court to
send their voices by proxy." According to Charles Seymour and Donald Paige
Frary, had not proxy voting been implemented, the inhabitants of the frontier
towns would have lost their franchises, and the government would have
represented only the freemen in the vicinity of Boston. The roads were poor;
the drawing of all a village's men at once would have exposed it to Indian
attacks; and at election time, the emigrants' labor was needed to get the
spring planting into the ground. As late as 1680, and probably even after the
charter was revoked in 1684, the Freeman might give his vote for Magistrates in
person or proxy at the Court of Elections. Proxy voting was also adopted in
colonies adjacent to Massachusetts. Indeed, traces of the practice of proxy
voting remained in Connecticut's election laws until the final supersedure of
her charter in 1819. In Maryland, the primary assemblies allowed proxy voting.
After the assembly of 1638, protests were sent to the proprietor in England. It
was said that the Governor and his friends were able to exercise too much
influence through the proxies they had obtained. Proxy voting was also used in
South Carolina; the proprietors in September 1683 complained to the governor
about this system. Proxy voting was used in Long Island, New York as well, at
that time. Phraseology was sometimes designed to hide the fact that a proxy
system was in use and that the majority of voters did not actually attend the
elections. In Rhode Island, the system described as a "proxy" system, from 1664
onward, was actually simply the sending of written ballots from voters who did
not attend the election, rather than a true proxy system, as in the assembly of
1647. In Alabama, the Perry County Civic League's members' assisting illiterate
voters by marking a ballot on their behalf was deemed "proxy voting" and
"voting more than once" and thus held to be illegal. During the American Civil
War, some northern soldiers used proxy voting. After Ira Eastman's near-victory
in New Hampshire, Republicans supported a bill to allow soldiers to vote by
proxy, but it was ruled unconstitutional by the state supreme court. In the
Progressive Era, proxy voting was used in Republican Party state conventions in
New Hampshire. The Boston and Maine Railroad, the Republican Party's ally,
maintained control over the Party by means of these conventions. "At the 1906
state convention, for instance, party delegates were quite willing to trade,
sell, or exchange their voting power in return for various forms of
remuneration from the party machine. Public outcry led to the end of such
'proxy' voting". Proxy voting was used in some American U.S. Presidential
nominating caucuses. In one case, Eugene McCarthy supporters were in the
majority of those present but were outvoted when the presiding party official
cast 492 proxy votes â€“ three times the number present â€“ for his own slate
of delegates. After the nomination of Hubert Humphrey, the New Politics
movement charged that Humphrey and party bosses had circumvented the will of
Democratic Party members by manipulating the rules to Humphrey's advantage. In
response, the Commission on Party Structure and Delegate Selection, also known
as the McGovern-Fraser Commission, was created to rework the rules in time for
the 1972 Democratic National Convention. State parties were required to ban
proxy voting in order to have their delegates seated at the national
convention. It was said that these rules had been used in "highly selective"
ways. Several attempts have been made to place proxy voting-related initiatives
on the California ballot, but all have failed. United States law on proxies.
Proxy is defined by supreme courts as "an "authority" or power to "do" a
certain thing." A person can confer on his proxy any power which he himself
possesses. He may also give him secret instructions as to voting upon
particular questions. But a proxy is ineffectual when it is contrary to law or
public policy. Where the proxy is duly appointed and he acts within the scope
of the proxy, the person authorizing the proxy is bound by his appointee's
acts, including his errors or mistakes. When the appointer sends his appointee
to a meeting, the proxy may do anything at that meeting necessary to a full and
complete exercise of the appointer's right to vote at such meeting. This
includes the right to vote to take the vote by ballot, or to adjourn (and,
hence, he may also vote on other ordinary parliamentary motions, such as to
refer, postpone, reconsider, etc., when necessary or when deemed appropriate
and advantageous to the overall object or purpose of the proxy). A proxy cannot
vote when the principal himself is present and votes. He can vote only in the
principal's absence. Where the authority conferred upon a proxy is limited to a
designated or special purpose, a vote for another and different purpose is
ineffective. A proxy in the usual, ordinary form confers authority to act only
at the meeting then in contemplation, and in any adjourned-meetings of the
same; hence, it may not be voted at another or different meeting held under a
"new call". A proxy's unauthorized acts may be ratified by his appointer, and
such ratification is equivalent to previous authority. According to the weight
of authority, a proxy only to vote stock may be revoked at any time,
notwithstanding any agreement that it shall be irrevocable. The sale in the
meantime by a stockholder of his shares in a corporation or company
automatically revokes any proxies made or given to vote in respect of such
shares. And a proxy is also revoked where the party giving it attends the
election in person, or gives subsequent proxy. Hence, a proxy cannot vote when
the owner of the stock arrives late or is present and votes. Vietnam. In
Vietnam, proxy voting was used to increase turnout. Presently, proxy voting is
illegal, but it has nonetheless been occurring since before 1989. It is
estimated to contribute about 20% to voter turnout, and has been described as
"a convenient way to fulfil one's duty, avoid possible risks, and avoid having
to participate directly in the act of voting". It is essentially a compromise
between the party-state, which wants to have high turnouts as proof of public
support, and voters who do not want to go to the polling stations. In the
Soviet Union, proxy voting was also illegal but done in order to increase
turnout figures. Nonprofit organization settings. Proxy voting is automatically
prohibited in organizations that have adopted Robert's Rules of Order (RONR) or
The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure (TSC) as their parliamentary
authority, unless it is provided for in its bylaws or charter or required by
the laws of its state of incorporation. Robert's Rules, 10th Edition expands
this such that "if the law under which an organization is incorporated allows
proxy voting to be prohibited by a provision of the bylaws, the adoption of
this book as a parliamentary authority by prescription in the bylaws should be
treated as sufficient provision to accomplish that result" (RONR 10th ed.
pp.Â 414â€“415, l. 33-2). Demeter says the same thing, but also states that "if
these laws do "not" prohibit voting by proxy, the body can pass a law
permitting proxy voting for any purpose desired." RONR opines, "Ordinarily it
should neither be allowed nor required, because proxy voting is incompatible
with the essential characteristics of a deliberative assembly in which
membership is individual, personal, and nontransferable. In a stock
corporation, on the other hand, where the ownership is transferable, the voice
and vote of the member also is transferable, by use of a proxy.". While Riddick
opines that "proxy voting properly belongs in incorporate organizations that
deal with stocks or real estate, and in certain political organizations," it
also states, "If a state empowers an incorporated organization to use proxy
voting, that right cannot be denied in the bylaws." Riddick further opines,
"Proxy voting is not recommended for ordinary use. It can discourage
attendance, and transfers an inalienable right to another without positive
assurance that the vote has not been manipulated." Nonetheless, it is common
practice in conventions for a delegate to have an alternate, who is basically
the same as a proxy. Demeter's Manual notes that the alternate has all the
privileges of voting, debate and participation in the proceedings to which the
delegate is entitled. Moreover, "if voting has for years...been conducted...by
proxy...such voting by long and continuous custom has the force of law, and the
proceedings are valid." Thomas E. Arend notes that U.S. laws allow proxy votes
to be conducted electronically in certain situations: "The use of electronic
media may be permissible for proxy voting, but such voting is generally limited
to members. Given the fiduciary duties that are personal to each director, and
the need for directors to deliberate to ensure properly considered decisions,
proxy voting by directors is usually prohibited by statute. In contrast, a
number of state nonprofit corporate statutes allow for member proxy voting and
may further allow members to use electronic media to grant a proxy right to
another party for member voting purposes." Sturgis agrees, "Directors or board
members cannot vote by proxy in their meetings, since this would mean the
delegation of a discretionary legislative duty which they cannot delegate."
Proxy voting, even if allowed, may be limited to infrequent use if the rules
governing a body specify minimum attendance requirements. For instance, bylaws
may prescribe that a member can be dropped for missing three consecutive
meetings. The Journal of Mental Science noted the arguments raised against
adopting proxy voting for the Association. These included that possibility that
it would diminish attendance at meetings. The rejoinder was that people did not
go there to vote; they attending the meetings for the sake of the meeting, the
discussion, and the good fellowship. In 2005, the Libertarian Party of
Colorado, following intense debate, enacted rules allowing proxy voting. A
motion to limit proxies to 5 per person was defeated. Some people favored
requiring members attending the convention to bring a certain number of
proxies, in order to encourage them to politick. In 2006, the party repealed
those bylaw provisions due to concerns that a small group of individuals could
use it to take control of the organization. Corporate settings. Under the
common law, shareholders had no right to cast votes by proxy in corporate
meetings without special authorization. In "Walker v. Johnson", the Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia explained that the reason was that early
corporations were of a municipal, religious or charitable nature, in which the
shareholder had no pecuniary interest. The normal mode of conferring corporate
rights was by an issue of a charter from the crown, essentially establishing
the corporation as a part of the government. Given the personal trust placed in
these voters by the king, it was inappropriate for them to delegate to others.
In the Pennsylvania case of "Commonwealth ex rel. Verree v. Bringhurst", the
court held that members of a corporation had no right to vote by proxy at a
corporate election unless such right was expressly conferred by the charter or
by a bylaw. The attorneys for the plaintiff argued that the common law rules
had no application to trading or moneyed corporations where the relation was
not personal. The court found, "The fact that it is a business corporation in
no wise dispenses with the obligation of all members to assemble together,
unless otherwise provided, for the exercise of a right to participate in the
election of their officers." At least as early as the 18th century, however,
clauses permitting voting by proxy were being inserted in corporate charters in
England. Proxy voting is commonly used in corporations for voting by members or
shareholders, because it allows members who have confidence in the judgment of
other members to vote for them and allows the assembly to have a quorum of
votes when it is difficult for all members to attend, or there are too many
members for all of them to conveniently meet and deliberate. Proxy firms
commonly advise institutional shareholders on how they should vote. Proxy
solicitation firms assist in helping corral votes for a certain resolution.
Domini notes that in the corporate world, "Proxy ballots typically contain
proposals from company management on issues of corporate governance, including
capital structure, auditing, board composition, and executive compensation."
Proxies are essentially the corporate law equivalent of absentee balloting.
Shareholders send in a card (called a proxy card) on which they mark their
vote. The card authorizes a proxy agent to vote the shareholder's stock as
directed on the card. The proxy card may specify how shares are to be voted or
may simply give the proxy agent discretion to decide how the shares are to be
voted. Under Securities Exchange Commission Rule 14a-3, the incumbent board of
directors' first step in soliciting proxies must be the distribution to
shareholders of the firm's annual report. An insurgent may independently
prepare proxy cards and proxy statements, which are sent to the shareholders.
Associations of institutional investors sometimes attempt to effect social
change. For instance, several hundred faith-based institutional investors, such
as denominations, pensions, etc. belong to the Interfaith Center on Corporate
Responsibility. These organizations commonly exercise influence through
shareholder resolutions, which may spur management to action and lead to the
resolutions' withdrawal before an actual vote on the resolution is taken. In
the absence of his principal from the annual meeting of a business corporation,
the proxy has the right to vote in all instances, but he has not the right to
debate or otherwise participate in the proceedings unless he is a stockholder
in that same corporation. The Securities Exchange Commission has ruled that an
investment adviser who exercises voting authority over his clients' proxies has
a fiduciary responsibility to adopt policies and procedures reasonably designed
to ensure that the adviser votes proxies in the best interests of clients, to
disclose to clients information about those policies and procedures, to
disclose to clients how they may obtain information on how the adviser has
voted their proxies, and to keep certain records related to proxy voting. This
ruling has been criticized on many grounds, including the contention that it
places unnecessary burdens on investment advisers and would not have prevented
the major accounting scandals of the early 2000s. It is possible for overvotes
and undervotes to occur in corporate proxy situations. Even in corporate
settings, proxy voting's use is generally limited to voting at the annual
meeting for directors, for the ratification of acts of the directors, for
enlargement or diminution of capital, and for other vital changes in the policy
of the organization. These proposed changes are summarized in the circular sent
to shareholders prior to the annual meeting. The stock-transfer book is closed
at least ten days before the annual meeting, to enable the secretary to prepare
a list of stockholders and the number of shares held by each. Stock is voted as
shown by the stock book when posted. All proxies are checked against this list.
It is possible to designate two or more persons to act as proxy by using
language appointing, for instance, "A, B, C, D, and E, F, or any of them,
attorneys and agents for me, irrevocable, with full power by the affirmative
vote of a majority of said attorneys and agents to appoint a substitute or
substitutes for and in the name and stead of me." Proxy voting is said to have
some anti-deliberative consequences, in that proxy holders often lack
discretion about how to cast votes due to the instructions given by their
principal. Thus, they cannot alter their decision based on the deliberative
process of testing the strength of arguments and counter-arguments. In Germany,
corporate proxy voting is done through banks. Proxy voting by banks has been a
key feature of the connection of banks to corporate ownership in Germany since
the industrialization period. Delegated voting. In delegated voting, also known
as liquid democracy, the proxy is transitive and the transfer is recursive. Put
simply, the vote can be further delegated to the proxy's proxy, and so on.
Delegated voting is also called transitive proxy, delegable proxy, asset
voting, delegate cascade, or (in application) "Liquid Democracy", and
"Augmented Democracy". An early proposal of delegate voting was that of Lewis
Carroll in 1884. More recent proposals are by Mikael Nordfors, Bryan Ford,
James Green-Armytage and Michael Allan. Delegate voting is used by the Swedish
local political party Demoex. Demoex won their first seat in the city council
of Vallentuna, Sweden, in 2002. The first years of activity in the party have
been evaluated by MitthÃ¶gskolan University in a paper by Karin Ottesen in
2003. In Demoex, a voter can also vote directly, even if she has delegated her
vote to a proxy; the direct vote overrules the proxy vote. It is also possible
to change the proxy at any time. In 2005, in a pilot study in Pakistan,
"Structural Deep Democracy, SD2" was used for leadership selection in a
sustainable agriculture group called Contact Youth. SD2 uses PageRank for the
processing of the transitive proxy votes, with the additional constraints of
mandating at least two initial proxies per voter, and all voters are proxy
candidates. More complex variants can be built on top of SD2, such as adding
specialist proxies and direct votes for specific issues, but SD2 as the
underlying umbrella system, mandates that generalist proxies should always be
used. Delegated voting is also used in the World Parliament Experiment. In
2012, the Dutch Pirate Party adopted the LiquidFeedback Interactive Democracy
software.
