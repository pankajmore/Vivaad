Front-runner Front-runner is a term to describe the leader in a race, whether
political or athletic. The term arose from the close symbolism between
political campaigns and athletic running events. The term is used in the U.S.
Presidential primary process to label the potential nominee with the lead in
the polls, the most name recognition, or most funds raised (or a combination of
these). The front-runner is most often anointed by the media who are following
the race, and is written about in a different style than his or her
challengers. Front-runner can also be used to describe a type of sports fan who
likes only the team that is winning. Also known as a "fairweather" fan, the
person will quickly, and repeatedly change allegiance with athletes and teams
as teams and players become "good" or "bad" based on records.
