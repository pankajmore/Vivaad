Dialectic Dialectic (also "dialectics" and "the dialectical method") is a
method of argument for resolving disagreement that has been central to Indian
and European philosophy since antiquity. The word "dialectic" originated in
ancient Greece, and was made popular by Plato in the Socratic dialogues. The
dialectical method is dialogue between two or more people holding different
points of view about a subject, who wish to establish the truth of the matter
by dialogue, with reasoned arguments. Dialectics is different from debate,
wherein the debaters are committed to their points of view, and mean to win the
debate, either by persuading the opponent, proving their argument correct, or
proving the opponent's argument incorrect ‚Äì thus, either a judge or a jury
must decide who wins the debate. Dialectics is also different from rhetoric,
wherein the speaker uses logos, pathos, or ethos to persuade listeners to take
their side of the argument. The Sophists taught "aretƒì" (Greek: , "quality",
"excellence") as the highest value, and the determinant of one's actions in
life. The Sophists taught artistic quality in oratory (motivation via speech)
as a manner of demonstrating one's "aretƒì". Oratory was taught as an art form,
used to please and to influence other people via excellent speech; nonetheless,
the Sophists taught the pupil to seek "aretƒì" in all endeavours, not solely in
oratory. Socrates favoured "truth" as the highest value, proposing that it
could be discovered through reason and logic in discussion: ergo, "dialectic".
Socrates valued rationality (appealing to logic, not emotion) as the proper
means for persuasion, the discovery of truth, and the determinant for one's
actions. To Socrates, "truth", not "aretƒì", was the greater good, and each
person should, above all else, seek truth to guide one's life. Therefore,
Socrates opposed the Sophists and their teaching of rhetoric as art and as
emotional oratory requiring neither logic nor proof. Different forms of
dialectical reasoning have emerged throughout history from the Indosphere
(Greater India) and the West (Europe). These forms include the Socratic method,
Hindu, Buddhist, Medieval, Hegelian dialectics, Marxist, Talmudic, and Neo-
orthodoxy. Principles. The purpose of the dialectic method of reasoning is
resolution of disagreement through rational discussion, and, ultimately, the
search for truth. One way to proceed‚Äîthe Socratic method‚Äîis to show that a
given hypothesis (with other admissions) leads to a contradiction; thus,
forcing the withdrawal of the hypothesis as a candidate for truth (see reductio
ad absurdum). Another dialectical resolution of disagreement is by denying a
presupposition of the contending thesis and antithesis; thereby, proceeding to
"sublation" (transcendence) to "synthesis", a third thesis. It is also possible
that the rejection of the participants' presuppositions is resisted, which then
might generate a second-order controversy. The concept of "dialectic" existed
in the philosophy of Heraclitus of Ephesus, who proposed that everything is in
constant change, as a result of inner strife and opposition. Hence, the history
of the dialectical method is the history of philosophy. Western dialectical
forms. Classical philosophy. In classical philosophy, dialectic () is a form of
reasoning based upon dialogue of arguments and counter-arguments, advocating
"propositions" (theses) and "counter-propositions" (antitheses). The outcome of
such a dialectic might be the refutation of a relevant proposition, or of a
synthesis, or a combination of the opposing assertions, or a qualitative
improvement of the dialogue. Moreover, the term "dialectic" owes much of its
prestige to its role in the philosophies of Socrates and Plato, in the Greek
Classical period (4‚Äì5 c. BCE). Aristotle said that it was the pre-Socratic
philosopher Zeno of Elea who invented dialectic, of which the dialogues of
Plato are the examples of the Socratic dialectical method. Socratic dialogue.
In Plato's dialogues and other Socratic dialogues, Socrates attempts to examine
someone's beliefs, at times even first principles or premises by which we all
reason and argue. Socrates typically argues by cross-examining his
interlocutor's claims and premises in order to draw out a contradiction or
inconsistency among them. According to Plato, the rational detection of error
amounts to finding the proof of the antithesis. However, important as this
objective is, the principal aim of Socratic activity seems to be to improve the
soul of his interlocutors, by freeing them from unrecognized errors. For
example, in the "Euthyphro", Socrates asks Euthyphro to provide a definition of
piety. Euthyphro replies that the pious is that which is loved by the gods.
But, Socrates also has Euthyphro agreeing that the gods are quarrelsome and
their quarrels, like human quarrels, concern objects of love or hatred.
Therefore, Socrates reasons, at least one thing exists that certain gods love
but other gods hate. Again, Euthyphro agrees. Socrates concludes that if
Euthyphro's definition of piety is acceptable, then there must exist at least
one thing that is both pious and impious (as it is both loved and hated by the
gods)‚Äîwhich Euthyphro admits is absurd. Thus, Euthyphro is brought to a
realization by this dialectical method that his definition of piety is not
sufficiently meaningful. There is another interpretation of the dialectic, as a
method of intuition suggested in The Republic. Simon Blackburn writes that the
dialectic in this sense is used to understand "the total process of
enlightenment, whereby the philosopher is educated so as to achieve knowledge
of the supreme good, the Form of the Good‚Äù. Medieval philosophy. Dialectics
(also called logic) was one of the three liberal arts taught in medieval
universities as part of the trivium. The trivium also included rhetoric and
grammar. Based mainly on Aristotle, the first medieval philosopher to work on
dialectics was Boethius. After him, many scholastic philosophers also made use
of dialectics in their works, such as Abelard, William of Sherwood, Garlandus
Compotista, Walter Burley, Roger Swyneshed and William of Ockham. Modern
philosophy. The concept of dialectics was given new life by Georg Wilhelm
Friedrich Hegel (following Fichte), whose dialectically dynamic model of nature
and of history made it, as it were, a fundamental aspect of the nature of
reality (instead of regarding the contradictions into which dialectics leads as
a sign of the sterility of the dialectical method, as Immanuel Kant tended to
do in his "Critique of Pure Reason"). In the mid-19th century, the concept of
"dialectic" was appropriated by Karl Marx (see, for example, "Das Kapital",
published in 1867) and Friedrich Engels and retooled in a non-idealist manner,
becoming a crucial notion in their philosophy of dialectical materialism. Thus
this concept has played a prominent role on the world stage and in world
history. In contemporary polemics, "dialectics" may also refer to an
understanding of how we can or should perceive the world (epistemology); an
assertion that the nature of the world outside one's perception is
interconnected, contradictory, and dynamic (ontology); or it can refer to a
method of presentation of ideas and conclusions (discourse). According to
Hegel, "dialectic" is the method by which human history unfolds; that is to
say, history progresses as a dialectical process. Hegelian dialectic. Hegelian
dialectic, usually presented in a threefold manner, was stated by Heinrich
Moritz Chalyb√§us as comprising three dialectical stages of development: a
thesis, giving rise to its reaction, an antithesis, which contradicts or
negates the thesis, and the tension between the two being resolved by means of
a synthesis. Although this model is often named after Hegel, he himself never
used that specific formulation. Hegel ascribed that terminology to Kant.
Carrying on Kant's work, Fichte greatly elaborated on the synthesis model, and
popularized it. On the other hand, Hegel did use a three-valued logical model
that is very similar to the antithesis model, but Hegel's most usual terms
were: Abstract-Negative-Concrete. Hegel used this writing model as a backbone
to accompany his points in many of his works. The formula, thesis-antithesis-
synthesis, does not explain why the thesis requires an Antithesis. However, the
formula, abstract-negative-concrete, suggests a flaw, or perhaps an incomplete-
ness, in any initial thesis‚Äîit is too abstract and lacks the negative of
trial, error and experience. For Hegel, the concrete, the synthesis, the
absolute, must always pass through the phase of the negative, in the journey to
completion, that is, mediation. This is the actual essence of what is popularly
called Hegelian Dialectics. To describe the activity of overcoming the
negative, Hegel also often used the term "Aufhebung", variously translated into
English as "sublation" or "overcoming," to conceive of the working of the
dialectic. Roughly, the term indicates preserving the useful portion of an
idea, thing, society, etc., while moving beyond its limitations. (Jacques
Derrida's preferred French translation of the term was "relever"). In the
"Logic", for instance, Hegel describes a dialectic of existence: first,
existence must be posited as pure Being ("Sein"); but pure Being, upon
examination, is found to be indistinguishable from Nothing ("Nichts"). When it
is realized that what is coming into being is, at the same time, also returning
to nothing (in life, for example, one's living is also a dying), both Being and
Nothing are united as Becoming. As in the Socratic dialectic, Hegel claimed to
proceed by making implicit contradictions explicit: each stage of the process
is the product of contradictions inherent or implicit in the preceding stage.
For Hegel, the whole of history is one tremendous dialectic, major stages of
which chart a progression from self-alienation as slavery to self-unification
and realization as the rational, constitutional state of free and equal
citizens. The Hegelian dialectic cannot be mechanically applied for any chosen
thesis. Critics argue that the selection of any antithesis, other than the
logical negation of the thesis, is subjective. Then, if the logical negation is
used as the antithesis, there is no rigorous way to derive a synthesis. In
practice, when an antithesis is selected to suit the user's subjective purpose,
the resulting "contradictions" are rhetorical, not logical, and the resulting
synthesis is not rigorously defensible against a multitude of other possible
syntheses. The problem with the Fichtean "Thesis-Antithesis-Synthesis" model is
that it implies that contradictions or negations come from outside of things.
Hegel's point is that they are inherent in and internal to things. This
conception of dialectics derives ultimately from Heraclitus. Hegel has outlined
that the purpose of dialectics is "to study things in their own being and
movement and thus to demonstrate the finitude of the partial categories of
understanding" One important dialectical principle for Hegel is the transition
from quantity to quality, which he terms the Measure. The measure is the
qualitative quantum, the quantum is the existence of quantity. As an example,
Hegel mentions the states of aggregation of water: "Thus the temperature of
water is, in the first place, a point of no consequence in respect of its
liquidity: still with the increase or diminution of the temperature of the
liquid water, there comes a point where this state of cohesion suffers a
qualitative change, and the water is converted into steam or ice". As other
examples Hegel mentions the reaching of a point where a single additional grain
makes a heap of wheat; or where the bald-tail is produced, if we continue
plucking out single hairs. Another important principle for Hegel is the
negation of the negation, which he also terms "Aufhebung" (sublation):
Something is only what it is in its relation to another, but by the negation of
the negation this something incorporates the other into itself. The dialectical
movement involves two moments that negate each other, something and its other.
As a result of the negation of the negation, "something becomes its other; this
other is itself something; therefore it likewise becomes an other, and so on ad
infinitum". Something in its passage into other only joins with itself, it is
self-related. In becoming there are two moments: coming-to-be and ceasing-to-
be: by sublation, i.e., negation of the negation, being passes over into
nothing, it ceases to be, but something new shows up, is coming to be. What is
sublated ("aufgehoben") on the one hand ceases to be and is put to an end, but
on the other hand it is preserved and maintained. In dialectics, a totality
transforms itself; it is self-related, then self-forgetful, relieving the
original tension. Marxist dialectics. In Marxism, the dialectical method of
historical study became intertwined with historical materialism, the school of
thought exemplified by the works of Marx, Engels, and Vladimir Lenin. In the
USSR, under Joseph Stalin, Marxist dialectics became "diamat" (short for
dialectical materialism), a theory emphasizing the primacy of the material way
of life, social "praxis," over all forms of social consciousness and the
secondary, dependent character of the "ideal." The term "dialectical
materialism" was coined by the 19th-century social theorist Joseph Dietzgen who
used the theory to explain the nature of socialism and social development. The
original populariser of Marxism in Russia, Georgi Plekhanov used the terms
"dialectical materialism" and "historical materialism" interchangeably. For
Lenin, the primary feature of Marx's "dialectical materialism" (Lenin's term)
was its application of materialist philosophy to history and social sciences.
Lenin's main input in the philosophy of dialectical materialism was his theory
of reflection, which presented human consciousness as a dynamic reflection of
the objective material world that fully shapes its contents and structure.
Later, Stalin's works on the subject established a rigid and formalistic
division of Marxist-Leninist theory in the dialectical materialism and
historical materialism parts. While the first was supposed to be the key method
and theory of the philosophy of nature, the second was the Soviet version of
the philosophy of history. A dialectical method was fundamental to Marxist
politics, e.g., the works of Karl Korsch, Georg Luk√°cs and certain members of
the Frankfurt School. Soviet academics, notably Evald Ilyenkov and Zaid
Orudzhev, continued pursuing unorthodox philosophic study of Marxist
dialectics; likewise in the West, notably the philosopher Bertell Ollman at New
York University. Indian forms of dialectic. Indian continental debate: an
intra- and inter-Dharmic dialectic. Anacker, Stefan (2005, rev. ed.). "Seven
Works of Vasubandhu: The Buddhist Psychological Doctor." Delhi, India: Motilal
Banarsidass. (First published: 1984; Reprinted: 1986, 1994, 1998; Corrected:
2002; Revised: 2005), p.20 Brahmin/Vedic/Hindu dialectic. While Western
philosophy traces dialectics to ancient Greek thought of Socrates and Plato,
the idea of tension between two opposing forces leading to synthesis is much
older and present in Hindu Philosophy. Indian philosophy, for the most part
subsumed within the Indian religions, has an ancient tradition of dialectic
polemics. The two complements, "purusha" (the active cause) and the "prakriti"
(the passive nature) brings everything into existence. They follow the "rta",
the Dharma (Universal Law of Nature). Jain dialectic. Anekantavada and Syadvada
are the sophisticated dialectic traditions developed by the Jains to arrive at
truth. As per Jainism, the truth or the reality is perceived differently from
different points of view, and that no single point of view is the complete
truth. Jain doctrine of Anekantavada states that an object has infinite modes
of existence and qualities and, as such, they cannot be completely perceived in
all its aspects and manifestations, due to the inherent limitations of being
human. Only the Kevalis‚Äîthe omniscient beings‚Äîcan comprehend the object in
all its aspects and manifestations, and that all others are capable of knowing
only a part of it. Consequently, no one view can claim to represent the
absolute truth. According to Jains, the ultimate principle should always be
logical and no principle can be devoid of logic or reason. Thus one finds in
the Jain texts, deliberative exhortations on any subject in all its facts, may
they be constructive or obstructive, inferential or analytical, enlightening or
destructive. Buddhist dialectic. Buddhism has developed sophisticated, and
sometimes highly institutionalized traditions of dialectics during its long
history. Nalanda University, and later the Gelugpa Buddhism of Tibet, are
examples. The historical development and clarification of Buddhist doctrine and
polemics, through dialectics and formal debate, is well documented. Buddhist
doctrine was rigorously critiqued (though not ultimately refuted) in the 2nd
century by Nagarjuna, whose uncompromisingly logical approach to the
realisation of truth, became the basis for the development of a vital stream of
Buddhist thought. This dialectical approach of Buddhism, to the elucidation and
articulation of an account of the Cosmos as the truth it really is, became
known as the Perfection of Wisdom and was later developed by other notable
thinkers, such as Dignaga and Dharmakirti (between 500 and 700). The
dialectical method of truth-seeking is evident throughout the traditions of
Madhyamaka, Yogacara, and Tantric Buddhism. Trisong Detsen, and later Je
Tsongkhapa, championed the value of dialectic and of formalised training in
debate in Tibet. Dialectical theology. Neo-orthodoxy, in Europe also known as
theology of crisis and dialectical theology, is an approach to theology in
Protestantism that was developed in the aftermath of the First World War
(1914‚Äì1918). It is characterized as a reaction against doctrines of 19th-
century liberal theology and a more positive reevaluation of the teachings of
the Reformation, much of which had been in decline (especially in western
Europe) since the late 18th century. It is primarily associated with two Swiss
professors and pastors, Karl Barth (1886‚Äì1968) and Emil Brunner
(1899‚Äì1966), even though Barth himself expressed his unease in the use of the
term. Dialectical method and dualism. Another way to understand dialectics is
to view it as a method of thinking to overcome formal dualism and monistic
reductionism. For example, formal dualism regards the opposites as mutually
exclusive entities, whilst monism finds each to be an epiphenomenon of the
other. Dialectical thinking rejects both views. The dialectical method requires
focus on both at the same time. It looks for a transcendence of the opposites
entailing a leap of the imagination to a higher level, which (1) provides
justification for rejecting both alternatives as false and/or (2) helps
elucidate a real but previously veiled integral relationship between apparent
opposites that have been kept apart and regarded as distinct. For example, the
superposition principle of quantum physics can be explained using the
dialectical method of thinking‚Äîlikewise the example below from dialectical
biology. Such examples showing the relationship of the dialectic method of
thinking to the scientific method to a large part negates the criticism of
Popper (see text below) that the two are mutually exclusive. The dialectic
method also examines false alternatives presented by formal dualism
(materialism vs idealism; rationalism vs empiricism; mind vs body, etc.) and
looks for ways to transcend the opposites and form synthesis. In the
dialectical method, both have something in common, and understanding of the
parts requires understanding their relationship with the whole system. The
dialectical method thus views the whole of reality as an evolving process.
Dialectical biology. In "The Dialectical Biologist" (Harvard U.P. 1985 ISBN 0-
674-20281-3), Richard Levins and Richard Lewontin sketch a dialectical approach
to biology. They see "dialectics" more as a set of questions to ask about
biological research, a weapon against dogmatism, than as a set of pre-
determined answers. They focus on the (dialectical) relationship between the
"whole" (or totality) and the "parts." "Part makes whole, and whole makes part"
(p.¬ 272). That is, a biological system of some kind consists of a collection
of heterogeneous parts. All of these contribute to the character of the whole,
as in reductionist thinking. On the other hand, the whole has an existence
independent of the parts and feeds back to affect and determine the nature of
the parts. This back-and-forth (dialectic) of causation implies a dynamic
process. For example, Darwinian evolution points to the competition of a
variety of species, each with heterogeneous members, within a given
environment. This leads to changing species and even to new species arising. A
dialectical biologist fully accepts this picture then looks for ways in which
the competing creatures (which serve as the internal conflicts in the
environment) lead to changes. The changes manifest in the creatures themselves,
through the creatures embracing biological adaptations that provide them with
advantages, and in the environment itself, as when the action of microbes
encourages the erosion of rocks. Further, each species is part of the
"environment" of all the others. Criticisms. Many philosophers have offered
critiques of dialectic, and it can even be said that hostility or receptivity
to dialectics is one of the things that divides twentieth-century Anglo-
American philosophy from the so-called "continental" tradition, a divide that
only a few contemporary philosophers (among them, G.H. von Wright, Paul
Ricoeur, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Richard Rorty, Charles Taylor) have ventured to
bridge. Karl Popper has attacked the dialectic repeatedly. In 1937 he wrote and
delivered a paper entitled "What Is Dialectic?" in which he attacked the
dialectical method for its willingness "to put up with contradictions". Popper
concluded the essay with these words: "The whole development of dialectic
should be a warning against the dangers inherent in philosophical system-
building. It should remind us that philosophy should not be made a basis for
any sort of scientific system and that philosophers should be much more modest
in their claims. One task which they can fulfill quite usefully is the study of
the critical methods of science" (Ibid., p.¬ 335). In chapter 12 of volume 2 of
"The Open Society and Its Enemies" (1944; 5th rev. ed., 1966) Popper unleashed
a famous attack on Hegelian dialectics, in which he held that Hegel's thought
(unjustly, in the view of some philosophers, such as Walter Kaufmann,) was to
some degree responsible for facilitating the rise of fascism in Europe by
encouraging and justifying irrationalism. In section 17 of his 1961 "addenda"
to "The Open Society", entitled "Facts, Standards and Truth: A Further
Criticism of Relativism," Popper refused to moderate his criticism of the
Hegelian dialectic, arguing that it "played a major role in the downfall of the
liberal movement in Germany... by contributing to historicism and to an
identification of might and right, encouraged totalitarian modes of thought.
¬ .¬ .¬ . undermined and eventually lowered the traditional standards of
intellectual responsibility and honesty". Formalism. In the past few decades,
European and American logicians have attempted to provide mathematical
foundations for dialectical logic or argument. There had been pre-formal
treatises on argument and dialectic, from authors such as Stephen Toulmin ("The
Uses of Argument"), Nicholas Rescher ("Dialectics"), and van Eemeren and
Grootendorst (Pragma-dialectics). One can include the communities of informal
logic and paraconsistent logic. However, building on theories of defeasible
reasoning (see John L. Pollock), systems have been built that define well-
formedness of arguments, rules governing the process of introducing arguments
based on fixed assumptions, and rules for shifting burden. Many of these logics
appear in the special area of artificial intelligence and law, though the
computer scientists' interest in formalizing dialectic originates in a desire
to build decision support and computer-supported collaborative work systems.
