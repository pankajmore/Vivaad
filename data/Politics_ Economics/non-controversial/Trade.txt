Trade Trade is the transfer of ownership of goods and services from one person
or entity to another by getting something in exchange from the buyer. Trade is
sometimes loosely called commerce or financial transaction or barter. A network
that allows trade is called a market. The original form of trade was barter,
the direct exchange of goods and services. Later one side of the barter were
the metals, precious metals (poles, coins), bill, paper money. Modern traders
instead generally negotiate through a medium of exchange, such as money. As a
result, buying can be separated from selling, or earning. The invention of
money (and later credit, paper money and non-physical money) greatly simplified
and promoted trade. Trade between two traders is called bilateral trade, while
trade between more than two traders is called multilateral trade. Trade exists
for man due to specialization and division of labor, most people concentrate on
a small aspect of production, trading for other products. Trade exists between
regions because different regions have a comparative advantage in the
production of some tradable commodity, or because different regions' size
allows for the benefits of mass production. As such, trade at market prices
between locations benefits both locations. Retail trade consists of the sale of
goods or merchandise from a very fixed location, such as a department store,
boutique or kiosk, or by mail, in small or individual lots for direct
consumption by the purchaser. Wholesale trade is defined as the sale of goods
or merchandise to retailers, to industrial, commercial, institutional, or other
professional business users, or to other wholesalers and related subordinated
services. Trading can also refer to the action performed by traders and other
market agents in the financial markets. History of trade. Prehistory. Trade
originated with the start of communication in prehistoric times. Trading was
the main facility of prehistoric people, who bartered goods and services from
each other before the innovation of the modern day currency. Peter Watson dates
the history of long-distance commerce from circa 150,000 years ago. In the
mediterranean region the earliest contact between cultures were of members of
the species "homo sapiens" principally using the Danube river, at a time
beginning 35-30,000 BC. Ancient history. Trade is believed to have taken place
throughout much of recorded human history. There is evidence of the exchange of
obsidian and flint during the stone age. Obsidian. New Guinea. Trade in
obsidian is believed to have taken place in New Guinea from 17,000 BC.
Mediterranean and Near East. Trade in the stone was investigated by Robert Carr
Bosanquet in excavations of 1901. Trade is believed to have first begun in
south west of Asia. Archaeological evidence of obsidian use provides data on
how this material was increasingly the preferred choice rather than chert from
the late Mesolithic to Neolithic, requiring exchange as deposits of obsidian
are rare in the Mediterranean region. Obsidian is thought to have provided the
material to make cutting utensils or tools, although since other more easily
obtainable material were available, use was found exclusive to the higher
status of the tribe using "the rich man's flint". Obsidian was traded at
distances of 900 kilometres within the region. Trade in the Mediterranean
during the Neolithic of Europe was greatest in this material. Networks were in
existence at around 12,000 BCE Anatolia was the source primarily for trade with
the Levant, Iran and Egypt according to Zarins study of 1990. Melos and Lipari
sources produced among the most widespread trading in the Mediterranean region
as known to archaeology. Lapis Lazuli. The Sari-i-Sang mine in the mountains of
Afghanistan was the largest source for trade. The material was most largely
traded during the Kassite period of Babylonia beginning 1595 BCE. Later trade.
Mediterranean and Near East. Ebla was a prominent trading centre during the
third millennia, with a network reaching into Anatolia and north Mesopotamia.
Materials used for creating jewelry were traded with Egypt since 3000 BC. Long-
range trade routes first appeared in the 3rd millennium BC, when Sumerians in
Mesopotamia traded with the Harappan civilization of the Indus Valley. The
Phoenicians were noted sea traders, traveling across the Mediterranean Sea, and
as far north as Britain for sources of tin to manufacture bronze. For this
purpose they established trade colonies the Greeks called emporia. From the
beginning of Greek civilization until the fall of the Roman empire in the 5th
century, a financially lucrative trade brought valuable spice to Europe from
the far east, including India and China. Roman commerce allowed its empire to
flourish and endure. The Roman empire produced a stable and secure
transportation network that enabled the shipment of trade goods without fear of
significant piracy. In ancient Greece Hermes was the god of trade (commerce)
and weights and measures, for Romans "Mercurius" also god of merchants, whose
festival was celebrated by traders on the 25th day of the fifth month. The
concept of free trade was an antithesis to the will and economic direction of
the sovereigns of the ancient Greek states. Free trade between states was
stifled by the need for strict internal controls (via taxation) to maintain
security within the treasury of the sovereign, which nevertheless enabled the
maintenance of a "" of civility within the structures of functional community
life. The fall of the Roman empire, and the succeeding Dark Ages brought
instability to Western Europe and a near collapse of the trade network in the
western world. Trade however continued to flourish among the kingdoms of
Africa, Middle East, India, China and Southeast Asia. Some trade did occur in
the west. For instance, Radhanites were a medieval guild or group (the precise
meaning of the word is lost to history) of Jewish merchants who traded between
the Christians in Europe and the Muslims of the Near East. the Orient.
Archaeological evidence (Greenberg 1951) of the first use of trade-marks are
from China dated about 2700 BC. Central America. The emergence of exchange
networks in the primitive societies of and near to Mexico are known to have
occurred within recent years before and after 1500 BC. Middle Ages. During the
Middle Ages, Central Asia was the economic center of the world. The Sogdians
dominated the East-West trade route known as the Silk Road after the 4th
century AD up to the 8th century AD, with Suyab and Talas ranking among their
main centers in the north. They were the main caravan merchants of Central
Asia. From the 8th to the 11th century, the Vikings and Varangians traded as
they sailed from and to Scandinavia. Vikings sailed to Western Europe, while
Varangians to Russia. The Hanseatic League was an alliance of trading cities
that maintained a trade monopoly over most of Northern Europe and the Baltic,
between the 13th and 17th centuries. Age of Discovery. Vasco da Gama pioneered
the European Spice trade in 1498 when he reached Calicut after sailing around
the Cape of Good Hope at the southern tip of the African continent. Prior to
this, the flow of spice into Europe from India was controlled by Islamic
powers, especially Egypt. The spice trade was of major economic importance and
helped spur the Age of Discovery in Europe. Spices brought to Europe from the
Eastern world were some of the most valuable commodities for their weight,
sometimes rivaling gold. In the sixteenth century, the Seventeen Provinces were
the centre of free trade, imposing no exchange controls, and advocating the
free movement of goods. Trade in the East Indies was dominated by Portugal in
the 16th century, Holland in the 17th century, and the British in the 18th
century. The Spanish Empire developed regular trade links across both the
Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans. In 1776, Adam Smith published the paper "An
Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations". It criticised
Mercantilism, and argued that economic specialisation could benefit nations
just as much as firms. Since the division of labour was restricted by the size
of the market, he said that countries having access to larger markets would be
able to divide labour more efficiently and thereby become more productive.
Smith said that he considered all rationalisations of import and export
controls "dupery", which hurt the trading nation as a whole for the benefit of
specific industries. In 1799, the Dutch East India Company, formerly the
world's largest company, became bankrupt, partly due to the rise of competitive
free trade. Age of Reason. The ascendancy of free trade was primarily based on
national advantage in the mid 19th century. That is, the calculation made was
whether it was in any particular country's self-interest to open its borders to
imports. John Stuart Mill proved that a country with monopoly pricing power on
the international market could manipulate the terms of trade through
maintaining tariffs, and that the response to this might be reciprocity in
trade policy. Ricardo and others had suggested this earlier. This was taken as
evidence against the universal doctrine of free trade, as it was believed that
more of the economic surplus of trade would accrue to a country following
"reciprocal", rather than completely free, trade policies. This was followed
within a few years by the infant industry scenario developed by Mill promoting
the theory that government had the "duty" to protect young industries, although
only for a time necessary for them to develop full capacity. This became the
policy in many countries attempting to industrialise and out-compete English
exporters. Milton Friedman later continued this vein of thought, showing that
in a few circumstances tariffs might be beneficial to the host country; but
never for the world at large. Twentieth century. The Great Depression was a
major economic recession that ran from 1929 to the late 1930s. During this
period, there was a great drop in trade and other economic indicators. The lack
of free trade was considered by many as a principal cause of the depression.
Only during the World War II the recession ended in the United States. Also
during the war, in 1944, 44 countries signed the Bretton Woods Agreement,
intended to prevent national trade barriers, to avoid depressions. It set up
rules and institutions to regulate the international political economy: the
International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (later divided into the World Bank and Bank for International
Settlements). These organisations became operational in 1946 after enough
countries ratified the agreement. In 1947, 23 countries agreed to the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to promote free trade. During the early years of
the Cold-war, the United States of America and the then Soviet USSR were
engaged in talks to exchange two captured military personnel, a "trade" carried
out during 1962 (Polmar p.Â 142). Protectionism. Protectionism is the policy of
restraining and discouraging trade between states and contrasts with the policy
of free trade. This policy often takes of form of tariffs and restrictive
quotas. Protectionist policies were particularly prevalent in the 1930s,
between the great depression and the onset of World War II. Religion. Muslim
teachings encourage trading (and condemn usury or interest). By trade the whole
society get benefits but interest makes the rich richer and the poor poorer.
Judeo-Christian teachings encourage traders to avoid dishonest gain.
Development of money. The first instances of money were objects with intrinsic
value. This is called commodity money and includes any commonly available
commodity that has intrinsic value; historical examples include pigs, rare
seashells, whale's teeth, and (often) cattle. In medieval Iraq, bread was used
as an early form of money. In Mexico under Montezuma cocoa beans were money.
[http://www.foodrevolution.org/slavery_chocolate.htm] Currency was introduced
as a standardised money to facilitate a wider exchange of goods and services.
This first stage of currency, where metals were used to represent stored value,
and symbols to represent commodities, formed the basis of trade in the Fertile
Crescent for over 1500 years. Numismatists have examples of coins from the
earliest large-scale societies, although these were initially unmarked lumps of
precious metal. Ancient Sparta minted coins from iron to discourage its
citizens from engaging in foreign trade. Current trends. Doha rounds. The Doha
round of World Trade Organization negotiations aims to lower barriers to trade
around the world, with a focus on making trade fairer for developing countries.
Talks have been hung over a divide between the rich developed countries,
represented by the G20, and the major developing countries. Agricultural
subsidies are the most significant issue upon which agreement has been hardest
to negotiate. By contrast, there was much agreement on trade facilitation and
capacity building. The Doha round began in Doha, Qatar, and negotiations have
subsequently continued in: CancÃºn, Mexico; Geneva, Switzerland; and Paris,
France and Hong Kong. China. Beginning around 1978, the government of the
People's Republic of China (PRC) began an experiment in economic reform. In
contrast to the previous Soviet-style centrally planned economy, the new
measures progressively relaxed restrictions on farming, agricultural
distribution and, several years later, urban enterprises and labor. The more
market-oriented approach reduced inefficiencies and stimulated private
investment, particularly by farmers, that led to increased productivity and
output. One feature was the establishment of four (later five) Special Economic
Zones located along the South-east coast. The reforms proved spectacularly
successful in terms of increased output, variety, quality, price and demand. In
real terms, the economy doubled in size between 1978 and 1986, doubled again by
1994, and again by 2003. On a real per capita basis, doubling from the 1978
base took place in 1987, 1996 and 2006. By 2008, the economy was 16.7 times the
size it was in 1978, and 12.1 times its previous per capita levels.
International trade progressed even more rapidly, doubling on average every 4.5
years. Total two-way trade in January 1998 exceeded that for all of 1978; in
the first quarter of 2009, trade exceeded the full-year 1998 level. In 2008,
China's two-way trade totaled US$2.56 trillion. In 1991 the PRC joined the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation group, a trade-promotion forum. In 2001, it
also joined the World Trade Organization. "See also:" Economy of the People's
Republic of China International trade. International trade is the exchange of
goods and services across national borders. In most countries, it represents a
significant part of GDP. While international trade has been present throughout
much of history (see Silk Road, Amber Road), its economic, social, and
political importance have increased in recent centuries, mainly because of
Industrialization, advanced transportation, globalization, multinational
corporations, and outsourcing. In fact, it is probably the increasing
prevalence of international trade that is usually meant by the term
"globalization". Empirical evidence for the success of trade can be seen in the
contrast between countries such as South Korea, which adopted a policy of
export-oriented industrialization, and India, which historically had a more
closed policy (although it has begun to open its economy, as of 2005). South
Korea has done much better by economic criteria than India over the past fifty
years, though its success also has to do with effective state institutions.
Trade sanctions. Trade sanctions against a specific country are sometimes
imposed, in order to punish that country for some action. An embargo, a severe
form of externally imposed isolation, is a blockade of all trade by one country
on another. For example, the United States has had an embargo against Cuba for
over 40 years. Trade barriers. Although there are usually few trade
restrictions within countries, international trade is usually regulated by
governmental quotas and restrictions, and often taxed by tariffs. Tariffs are
usually on imports, but sometimes countries may impose export tariffs or
subsidies. All of these are called trade barriers. If a government removes all
trade barriers, a condition of free trade exists. A government that implements
a protectionist policy establishes trade barriers. Fair trade. The fair trade
movement, also known as the trade justice movement, promotes the use of labour,
environmental and social standards for the production of commodities,
particularly those exported from the Third and Second Worlds to the First
World. Such ideas have also sparked a debate on whether trade itself should be
codified as a human right. Importing firms voluntarily adhere to fair trade
standards or governments may enforce them through a combination of employment
and commercial law. Proposed and practiced fair trade policies vary widely,
ranging from the common prohibition of goods made using slave labour to minimum
price support schemes such as those for coffee in the 1980s. Non-governmental
organizations also play a role in promoting fair trade standards by serving as
independent monitors of compliance with fair trade labeling requirements.
