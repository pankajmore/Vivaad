County executive A county executive is the head of the executive branch of
government in a county. This position is common in the United States. The
executive may be an elected or an appointed position. When elected, the
executive typically functions either as a voting member of the elected county
government, or may have veto power similar to other elected executives such as
a governor, president or mayor. When appointed, the executive is usually hired
for a specific period of time, but frequently can be dismissed prior to this.
The position of an appointed county executive is analogous to that of a city
manager, and is similar to a chief administrative officer, depending on the
state. The executive is generally given full responsibility for the total
operation of all departments based on general directives provided by the
elected county government that hired the executive.
