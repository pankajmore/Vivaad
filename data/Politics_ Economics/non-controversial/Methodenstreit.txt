Methodenstreit Methodenstreit (German for "method dispute"), in intellectual
history beyond German-language discourse, was an economics controversy carried
on for about a decade around 1890, between that field's Austrian School and the
(German) Historical School. On an intellectual level it concerned whether any
science (as opposed to only history) could explain the dynamics of human
action; politically, it reflected conflict between the minarchism of the early
Austrian School and the welfare state advocated by the Historical School. In
it, Carl Menger led the supporters of the Austrian School's view, and Gustav
von Schmoller proponents of the Historical School's. History. Background. The
Historical School contended that economists could develop new and better social
laws from the collection and study of statistics and historical materials, and
distrusted theories not derived from historical experience. Thus, the German
Historical School focused on specific dynamic institutions as the largest
variable in changes in political economy. The Historical School were themselves
reacting against materialist determinism, the idea that human action could, and
would (once science advanced enough), be explained as physical and chemical
reactions. The Austrian School, carefully founded and first developed by Carl
Menger in the 1860ies, and published in 1871 as "GrundsÃ¤tze der
Volkswirtschaftslehre" (English title: "Principles of Economics"), by contrast
believed that economics was the work of philosophical logic and could only ever
be about developing rules from first principlesÂ â€” seeing human motives and
social interaction as far too complex to be amenable to statistical
analysisÂ â€” and purporting their theories of human action to be universally
valid. Menger and the German Historical School. The first move was when Carl
Menger attacked Schmoller and the German Historical School, in his 1883 book
"Investigations into the Method of the Social Sciences with Special Reference
to Economics (Untersuchungen Ã¼ber die Methode der Socialwissenschaften und der
politischen Ã–konomie insbesondere)." Menger thought the best method of
studying economics was through reason and finding general theories which
applied to broad areas. Menger, as did the Austrians and other neo-classical
economists, concentrated upon the subjective, atomistic nature of economics. He
emphasized the subjective factors. He said the grounds for economics were built
upon self-interest, evaluation on the margin, and incomplete knowledge. He said
aggregative, collective ideas could not have adequate foundation unless they
rested upon individual components. The direct attack on the German Historical
School lead Schmoller to responded quickly with an unfavourable and quite
hostile review of Menger's book. Menger accepted the challenge and replied in a
passionate pamphlet, written in the form of letters to a friend, in which he
(according to Hayek) "ruthlessly demolished Schmoller's position". The
encounter between the masters was soon imitated by their disciples. A degree of
hostility not often equaled in scientific controversy developed. Consequences.
The term "Austrian school of economics" came into existence as a result of the
"Methodenstreit," when Schmoller used it in an unfavourable review of one of
Menger's later books, intending to convey an impression of backwardness and
obscurantism of Habsburg Austria compared to the more modern Prussians. A
serious consequence of the hostile debate was that Schmoller went so far as to
declare publicly that members of the "abstract" school were unfit to fill a
teaching position in a German university, and his influence was quite
sufficient to make this equivalent to a complete exclusion of all adherents to
Menger's doctrines from academic positions in Germany. The result was that even
thirty years after the close of the controversy Germany was still less affected
by the new ideas now spreading elsewhere, than any other academically important
country in the world. Related rivalry. Another famous â€” and somewhat related
â€” "Methodenstreit" in the 1890s pitted the German social and economic
historian Karl Lamprecht against several prominent political historians,
particularly Friedrich Meinecke, over Lamprecht's use of social scientific and
psychological methods in his research. The dispute resulted in Lamprecht and
his work being widely discredited among academic German historians. As a
consequence, German historians pursued more political and ideological
historical questions, while Lamprecht's style of interdisciplinary history was
largely abandoned. Lamprecht's work remained influential elsewhere, however,
particularly in the tradition of the French Annales School.
