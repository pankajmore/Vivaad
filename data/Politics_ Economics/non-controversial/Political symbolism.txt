Political symbolism Political symbolism is symbolism that is used to represent
a political standpoint. The symbolism can occur in various media including
banners, acronyms, pictures, flags, mottos, and countless more. For example,
Red flags have traditionally been flown by socialists, left-wing radicals, and
communist groups to represent the "blood of the workers". Black flags have
traditionally been flown by anarchism, and left-wing radicals to represent the
absence of all oppressive structures. A combination of the two colors in a
black flag represents social anarchism, such as anarchist communism and anarcho
syndicalism. Many groups use the political colour associated with their
political philosophy, for example blue, particularly dark blue, is often
associated with Conservative parties. Cultural groups may use symbols in what
many consider to be a political way, for example LGBT symbols like the Rainbow
flag are used to promote the political goal of LGBT rights.
