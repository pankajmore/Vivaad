Peterloo Massacre The Peterloo Massacre (or Battle of Peterloo) occurred at St
Peter's Field, Manchester, England, on 16Â August 1819, when cavalry charged
into a crowd of 60,000â€“80,000 that had gathered to demand the reform of
parliamentary representation. The end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 had
resulted in periods of famine and chronic unemployment, exacerbated by the
introduction of the first of the Corn Laws. By the beginning of 1819 the
pressure generated by poor economic conditions, coupled with the lack of
suffrage in northern England, had enhanced the appeal of political radicalism.
In response, the Manchester Patriotic Union, a group agitating for
parliamentary reform, organised a demonstration to be addressed by the well-
known radical orator Henry Hunt. Shortly after the meeting began, local
magistrates called on the military authorities to arrest Hunt and several
others on the hustings with him, and to disperse the crowd. Cavalry charged
into the crowd with sabres drawn, and in the ensuing confusion, 15Â people were
killed and 400â€“700 were injured. The massacre was given the name Peterloo in
ironic comparison to the Battle of Waterloo, which had taken place four years
earlier. Historian Robert Poole has called the Peterloo Massacre one of the
defining moments of its age. In its own time, the London and national papers
shared the horror felt in the Manchester region, but Peterloo's immediate
effect was to cause the government to crack down on reform, with the passing of
what became known as the Six Acts. It also led directly to the foundation of
"The Manchester Guardian" (now "The Guardian"), but had little other effect on
the pace of reform. In a survey conducted by "The Guardian" in 2006, Peterloo
came second to the Putney Debates as the event from British history that most
deserved a proper monument or a memorial. Peterloo is commemorated by a plaque
close to the site, a replacement for an earlier one that was criticised as
being inadequate as it did not reflect the scale of the massacre. Background.
Suffrage. In 1819, Lancashire was represented by two Members of Parliament
(MPs). Voting was restricted to the adult male owners of freehold land valued
at 40Â shillings or moreÂ â€“ the equivalent of about Â£80 as of 2008Â â€“ and
votes could only be cast at the county town of Lancaster, by a public spoken
declaration at the hustings. Constituency boundaries were out of date, and the
so-called "rotten boroughs" had a hugely disproportionate influence on the
membership of the Parliament of the United Kingdom compared to the size of
their populations: Old Sarum in Wiltshire, with one voter, elected two MPs, as
did Dunwich in Suffolk, which by the early 19th century had almost completely
disappeared into the sea. The major urban centres of Manchester, Salford,
Bolton, Blackburn, Rochdale, Ashton-under-Lyne, Oldham and Stockport, with a
combined population of almost one million, were represented by either the two
county MPs for Lancashire, or the two for Cheshire in the case of Stockport. By
comparison, more than half of all MPs were elected by a total of just
154Â voters. These inequalities in political representation led to calls for
reform. Economic conditions. After the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, a
brief boom in textile manufacture was followed by periods of chronic economic
depression, particularly among textile weavers and spinners. Weavers who could
have expected to earn 15Â shillings for a six-day week in 1803, saw their wages
cut to 5Â shillings or even 4sÂ 6d by 1818. The industrialists, who were
cutting wages without offering relief, blamed market forces generated by the
aftershocks of the Napoleonic Wars. Exacerbating matters were the Corn Laws,
the first of which was passed in 1815, imposing a tariff on foreign grain in an
effort to protect English grain producers. The cost of food rose as people were
forced to buy the more expensive and lower quality British grain, and periods
of famine and chronic unemployment ensued, increasing the desire for political
reform both in Lancashire and in the country at large. Unknown to either
Johnson or Hunt, the letter was intercepted by government spies and copied
before being sent on to its destination. The contents were interpreted to mean
that an insurrection was being planned, and the government immediately
responded by ordering the 15th Hussars to Manchester. The mass public meeting
planned for 2Â August was delayed until 9 August. Announcing the delay, the
"Manchester Observer" reported that the intention of the meeting was "to take
into consideration the most speedy and effectual mode of obtaining Radical
reform in the Common House of Parliament" and "to consider the propriety of the
'Unrepresented Inhabitants of Manchester' electing a person to represent them
in Parliament". The local magistrates, under the leadership of William Hulton,
had already been advised by the acting Home Secretary, Henry Hobhouse, that
"the election of a Member of Parliament without the King's writ" was a serious
misdemeanour, encouraging them to declare the assembly illegal. Rehearsals.
Although banning the 9Â August meeting had been intended to discourage the
radicals entirely, Hunt and his followers were determined to assemble. A new
meeting was organised for 16Â August, after the Home Secretary, Lord Sidmouth,
had written to the magistrates instructing them that it was not the "intention"
to elect an MP that was illegal, but the execution of that intention. The press
had frequently mocked previous meetings of working men because of their ragged,
dirty appearance and disorganised conduct. The organisers were determined that
those attending the meeting at St Peter's Field would be neatly turned out and
would march to the event in good order. Samuel Bamford, a local radical who led
the Middleton contingent to the assembly, wrote that "It was deemed expedient
that this meeting should be as morally effective as possible, and, that it
should exhibit a spectacle such as had never before been witnessed in England."
Instructions were given to the various committees forming the contingents that
"Cleanliness, Sobriety, Order and Peace" and a "prohibition of all weapons of
offence or defence" were to be observed throughout the demonstration. Each
contingent was drilled and rehearsed in the fields of the townships around
Manchester, further adding to the concerns of the authorities. One spy reported
that "seven hundred men drilled at Tandle Hill as well as any army regiment
would". A royal proclamation forbidding the practice of drilling was posted in
Manchester on . Assembly. Preparations. St Peter's Field was a croft (an open
piece of land) alongside Mount Street which was being cleared to enable the
last section of Peter Street to be constructed. Piles of brushwood had been
placed at the end of the field nearest to the Friends Meeting House, but the
remainder of the field was clear. Thomas Worrell, Manchester's Assistant
Surveyor of Paving, arrived to inspect the field at 7:00Â am. His job was to
remove anything that might be used as a weapon, and he duly had "about a
quarter of a load" of stones carted away. Monday, 16Â August 1819, was a hot
summer's day, with a cloudless blue sky. The fine weather almost certainly
increased the size of the crowd significantly; marching from the outer
townships in the cold and rain would have been a much less attractive prospect.
The Manchester magistrates met at 9:00Â am, to breakfast at the Star Inn on
Deansgate and to consider what action they should take on Henry Hunt's arrival
at the meeting. By 10:30Â am they had come to no conclusions, and moved to a
house on the southeastern corner of St Peter's Field, from where they planned
to observe the meeting. They were concerned that it would end in a riot, or
even a rebellion, and had arranged for a substantial number of regular troops
and militia yeomanry to be deployed. The military presence comprised 600Â men
of the ; several hundred infantrymen; a Royal Horse Artillery unit with two
six-pounder (2.7Â kg) guns; 400Â men of the Cheshire Yeomanry; 400Â special
constables; and 120Â cavalry of the Manchester and Salford Yeomanry, relatively
inexperienced militia recruited from among local shopkeepers and tradesmen, the
most numerous of which were publicans. The Yeomanry were variously described as
"younger members of the Tory party in arms", and as "hot-headed young men, who
had volunteered into that service from their intense hatred of Radicalism". The
revised meeting date of 16Â August, however, coincided with the horse races at
York, a fashionable event at which Byng had entries in two races. He once again
wrote to the Home Office, saying that although he would still be prepared to be
in command in Manchester on the day of the meeting if it was thought really
necessary, he had absolute confidence in his deputy commander, Lieutenant
Colonel Guy L'Estrange. Meeting. The crowd that gathered in St Peter's Field
arrived in disciplined and organised contingents. Each village or chapelry was
given a time and a place to meet, from where its members were to proceed to
assembly points in the larger towns or townships, and from there on to
Manchester. Contingents were sent from all around the region, the largest and
"best dressed" of which was a group of 10,000 who had travelled from Oldham
Green, comprising people from Oldham, Royton (which included a sizable female
section), Crompton, Lees, Saddleworth and Mossley. Other sizable contingents
marched from Middleton and Rochdale (6,000 strong) and Stockport (1,500â€“5,000
strong). Reports of the size of the crowd at the meeting vary substantially.
Contemporaries estimated it from 30,000 to as many as 150,000; modern estimates
are 60,000â€“80,000. Scholar Joyce Marlow describes the event as "The most
numerous meeting that ever took place in Great Britain" and elaborates that the
generally accepted figure of 60,000 would have been 6% of the population of
Lancashire, or half the population of the immediate area around Manchester.
Although some observers, like the Rev. W. R. Hay, chairman of the Salford
Quarter Sessions, claimed that "The active part of the meeting may be said to
have come in wholly from the country", others such as John Shuttleworth, a
local cotton manufacturer, estimated that most were from Manchester, a view
that would subsequently be supported by the casualty lists. Of the casualties
whose residence was recorded, 61% lived within a three-mile radius of the
centre of Manchester. Some groups carried banners with texts like "No Corn
Laws", "Annual Parliaments", "Universal suffrage" and "Vote By Ballot". The
only banner known to have survived is in Middleton Public Library. It was
carried by Thomas Redford, who was injured by a yeomanry sabre. Made of green
silk embossed with gold lettering, one side of the banner is inscribed "Liberty
and Fraternity" and the other "Unity and Strength". At about noon, several
hundred special constables were led onto the field. They formed two lines in
the crowd a few yards apart, in an attempt to form a corridor through the crowd
between the house where the magistrates were watching and the hustings, two
waggons lashed together. Believing that this might be intended as the route by
which the magistrates would later send their representatives to arrest the
speakers, some members of the crowd pushed the waggons away from the
constables, and pressed around the hustings to form a human barrier. Hunt's
carriage arrived at the meeting shortly after 1:00Â pm, and he made his way to
the hustings. Alongside Hunt on the speakers' stand were John Knight, a cotton
manufacturer and reformer, Joseph Johnson, the organiser of the meeting, John
Thacker Saxton, managing editor of the "Manchester Observer", the publisher
Richard Carlile, and George Swift, reformer and shoemaker. There were also a
number of reporters, including John Tyas of "The Times", John Smith of the
"Liverpool Echo" and Edward Baines Jr, the son of the editor of the "Leeds
Mercury". By this time St Peter's Field, an area of , was packed with tens of
thousands of men, women and children. The crowd around the speakers was so
dense that "their hats seemed to touch"; large groups of curious spectators
gathered on the outskirts of the crowd. The rest of Manchester was like a ghost
town, the streets and shops were empty. Cavalry charge. The notes were handed
to two horsemen who were standing by. The Manchester and Salford Yeomanry were
stationed just a short distance away in Portland Street, and so received their
note first. They immediately drew their swords and galloped towards St Peter's
Field. One trooper, in a frantic attempt to catch up, knocked down a woman in
Cooper Street, causing the death of her child when he was thrown from her arms;
two-year-old William Fildes was the first casualty of Peterloo. Sixty
cavalrymen of the Manchester and Salford Yeomanry, led by Captain Hugh Hornby
Birley, a local factory owner, arrived at the house from where the magistrates
were watching; some reports allege that they were drunk. Andrews, the Chief
Constable, instructed Birley that he had an arrest warrant which he needed
assistance to execute. Birley was asked to take his cavalry to the hustings to
allow the speakers to be removed; it was by then about 1:40Â pm. The route
towards the hustings between the special constables was narrow, and as the
inexperienced horses were thrust further and further into the crowd they reared
and plunged as people tried to get out of their way. The arrest warrant had
been given to the Deputy Constable, Joseph Nadin, who followed behind the
yeomanry. As the cavalry pushed towards the speakers' stand they became stuck
in the crowd, and in panic started to hack about them with their sabres. On his
arrival at the stand Nadin arrested Hunt, Johnson and a number of others
including John Tyas, the reporter from "The Times". According to Tyas the
yeomanry's progress through the crowd had provoked a hail of bricks and stones,
and caused them to lose "all command of temper". Their mission to execute the
arrest warrant having been achieved, they then set about destroying the banners
and flags carried by the crowd. From his vantage point William Hulton perceived
the unfolding events as an assault on the yeomanry, and on L'Estrange's arrival
at 1:50Â pm, at the head of his hussars, he ordered them into the field to
disperse the crowd with the words: "Good God, Sir, don't you see they are
attacking the Yeomanry; disperse the meeting!" The 15th Hussars formed
themselves into a line stretching across the eastern end of St Peter's Field,
and charged into the crowd. At about the same time the Cheshire Yeomanry
charged from the southern edge of the field. At first the crowd had some
difficulty in dispersing, as the main exit route into Peter Street was blocked
by the 88th Regiment of Foot, standing with bayonets fixed. One officer of the
15th Hussars was heard trying to restrain the by now out of control Manchester
and Salford Yeomanry, who were "cutting at every one they could reach": "For
shame! For shame! Gentlemen: forbear, forbear! The people cannot get away!"
However, within ten minutes the crowd had been dispersed, at the cost of
11Â dead and over 600Â injured. Only the wounded, their helpers, and the dead
were left behind. A woman living nearby said she saw "a very great deal of
blood". For some time afterwards there was rioting in the streets, most
seriously at New Cross, where troops fired on a crowd attacking a shop
belonging to someone rumoured to have taken one of the women reformers' flags
as a souvenir. Peace was not restored in Manchester until the next morning, and
in Stockport and Macclesfield rioting continued on the 17th. There was also a
major riot in Oldham that day, during which one person was shot and wounded.
Victims. The exact number of those killed and injured at Peterloo has never
been established with certainty. Sources claim 11â€“15Â killed and
400â€“700Â injured. The Manchester Relief Committee, a body set up to provide
relief for the victims of Peterloo, gave the number of injured as 420, while
Radical sources listed 500. The true number is difficult to estimate, as many
of the wounded hid their injuries for fear of retribution by the authorities.
Three of William Marsh's six children worked in the factory belonging to
Captain Hugh Birley of the Manchester Yeomanry, and lost their jobs because
their father had attended the meeting. James Lees was admitted to Manchester
Infirmary with two severe sabre wounds to the head, but was refused treatment
and sent home after refusing to agree with the surgeon's insistence that "he
had had enough of Manchester meetings". A particular feature of the meeting at
Peterloo was the number of women present. Female reform societies had been
formed in North West England during June and July 1819, the first in Britain.
Many of them were dressed distinctively in white, and some formed all-female
contingents, carrying their own flags. Of the 654Â recorded casualties, at
least 168 were women, four of whom died either at St Peter's Field or later as
a result of their wounds. It has been estimated that less than 12% of the crowd
was made up of females, suggesting that women were at significantly greater
risk of injury than men by a factor of almost 3:1. Richard Carlile claimed that
the women were especially targeted, a view apparently supported by the large
number who suffered from wounds caused by weapons. Eleven of the fatalities
listed occurred on St Peter's Field. Others, such as John Lees of Oldham, died
later of their wounds, and some like Joshua Whitworth were killed in the
rioting that followed the crowd's dispersal from the field. Reaction and
aftermath. Public. The Peterloo Massacre has been called one of the defining
moments of its age. Many of those present at the massacre, including local
masters, employers and owners, were horrified by the carnage. One of the
casualties, Oldham cloth-worker and ex-soldier John Lees, who died from his
wounds on 7 September, had been present at the Battle of Waterloo. Shortly
before his death he said to a friend that he had never been in such danger as
at Peterloo: "At Waterloo there was man to man but there it was downright
murder." When news of the massacre began to spread, the population of
Manchester and surrounding districts were horrified and outraged. Publications.
This was the first public meeting at which journalists from a number of
important, distant newspapers were present and, within a day or so of the
event, accounts were published as far away as London, Leeds and Liverpool. The
London and national papers shared the horror felt in the Manchester region, and
the feeling of indignation throughout the country became intense. James Wroe as
editor of the "Manchester Observer" was the first journalist to describe the
incident at the "Peterloo Massacre", coining his headline from combining the
name of the meeting place, St Peter's Field, with the Battle of Waterloo that
had taken place only four years before. Wroe subsequently wrote pamphlets
entitled "The Peterloo Massacre: A Faithful Narrative of the Events". Priced at
2d each, they sold out each print run for 14 weeks, having a large national
circulation. The poet Percy Bysshe Shelley was living in Italy at the time and
did not hear of the massacre until 5 September. He immediately wrote a poem
entitled "The Masque of Anarchy", subtitled "Written on the Occasion of the
Massacre at Manchester", and sent it for publication in the radical periodical
"The Examiner". However, due to restrictions on the radical press the poem was
not published until 1832. Many commemorative items such as plates, jugs,
handkerchiefs and medals were produced, all with the iconic image of Peterloo;
cavalrymen with swords drawn riding down and slashing at defenceless civilians.
Political. The immediate effect of Peterloo was a crackdown on reform. The
government instructed the police and courts to go after the journalists,
presses and publication that was the "Manchester Observer." Wroe was arrested
and charged with producing a seditious publication. Found guilty he was
sentenced to twelve months in prison, plus a Â£100 fine. Outstanding libelous
court cases against the "Manchester Observer" were suddenly rushed through the
courts, and even a continual change of sub-editors was not sufficient a defence
against a series of police raids, often just on the suspicion of the newspaper
writing a radical article. The result was that the "Manchester Observer" was
almost continually shutdown from late 1819 onwards, finally closing in February
1820 where it recommended in editorial that readers now follow events via the
newly formed "Manchester Guardian". Hunt and eight others were tried at York
Assizes on 16 March 1820, charged with sedition. After a two-week trial, five
of the ten defendants were found guilty. Hunt was sentenced to 30Â months in
Ilchester Gaol; Bamford, Johnson, and Healey were given one year each, and
Knight was jailed for two years on a subsequent charge. A test case was brought
against four members of the Manchester Yeomanry at Lancaster Assizes, on 4
April 1822: Captain Birley, Captain Withington, Trumpeter Meagher, and Private
Oliver. All were acquitted, as the court ruled that their actions had been
justified to disperse an illegal gathering. For a few months following Peterloo
it seemed to the authorities that the country was heading towards an armed
rebellion. Encouraging them in that belief were two abortive uprisings, in
Huddersfield and Burnley, during the autumn of 1819, and the discovery and
foiling of the Cato Street Conspiracy to blow up the cabinet that winter. By
the end of the year, the government had introduced legislation, later known as
the Six Acts, to suppress radical meetings and publications, and by the end of
1820 every significant working-class radical reformer was in jail; civil
liberties had declined to an even lower level than they were before Peterloo.
Historian Robert Reid has written that "it is not fanciful to compare the
restricted freedoms of the British worker in the post-Peterloo period in the
early nineteenth century with those of the black South African in the post-
Sharpeville period of the late twentieth century". One direct consequence of
Peterloo was the foundation of the "Manchester Guardian" newspaper in 1821, by
the Little Circle group of non-conformist Manchester businessmen headed by John
Edward Taylor, a witness to the massacre. The prospectus announcing the new
publication proclaimed that it would "zealously enforce the principles of civil
and religious LibertyÂ ... warmly advocate the cause of ReformÂ ... endeavour
to assist in the diffusion of just principles of Political Economy andÂ ...
support, without reference to the party from which they emanate, all
serviceable measures". Events such as the Pentridge Rising, the March of the
Blanketeers and the Spa Fields meeting, all serve to indicate the breadth,
diversity and widespread geographical scale of the demand for economic and
political reform at the time. Peterloo had no effect on the speed of reform,
but in due course all but one of the reformer's demands, annual parliaments,
were met. Following the Great Reform Act of 1832, the newly created Manchester
parliamentary borough elected its first two MPs. Five candidates including
William Cobbett stood, and the Whigs, Charles Poulett Thomson and Mark Philips,
were elected. Manchester became a Municipal Borough in 1837, and what remained
of the manorial rights were subsequently purchased by the borough council.
Commemoration. The Free Trade Hall, home of the Anti-Corn Law League, was built
partly as a "cenotaph raised on the shades of the victims" of Peterloo. Until
2007 the massacre was commemorated by a blue plaque on the wall of the present
building, the third to occupy the site, now the Radisson Hotel. It was regarded
as a less than appropriate memorial because it under reported the incident as a
dispersal, and the deaths were omitted completely. In a 2006 survey conducted
by "The Guardian", Peterloo came second to St. Mary's Church, Putney, the venue
for the Putney Debates, as the event from British history that most deserved a
proper monument. A Peterloo Massacre Memorial Campaign was set up to lobby for
a more appropriate monument to an event that has been described as Manchester's
Tiananmen Square. In 1968, in celebration of its centenary, the Trades Union
Congress commissioned British composer Sir Malcolm Arnold to write the
"Peterloo Overture". Other 20th-century musical commemorations include "Ned
Ludd Part 5" on electric folk group Steeleye Span's 2006 album "Bloody Men",
and Rochdale rock band Tractor's suite of five songs written and recorded in
1973, later included on their 1992 release "Worst Enemies". References. Notes
