History of terrorism The history of terrorism is a history of well-known and
historically significant individuals, entities, and incidents associated,
whether rightly or wrongly, with terrorism. Scholars agree that terrorism is a
disputed term, and very few of those labelled terrorists describe themselves as
such. It is common for opponents in a violent conflict to describe the other
side as terrorists. Those called terrorists can often be referred to as
militants, paramilitaries, guerrillas, resistance movements or freedom
fighters. However, they are united in the range of tactics they commonly employ
which involves non-systemic covert or semi-covert warfare, driven by an
ideological basis often political religious or socially based. They often seek
to use propaganda of the deed to cause a psychological impact alongside the
actions themselves to drive the aspired change. Early terrorism. Scholars
dispute whether the roots of terrorism date back to the 1st century and the
Sicarii Zealots, to the 11th century and the Al-Hashshashin, to the 19th
century and Narodnaya Volya, or to other eras. The Sicarii and Hashshashin are
described below, while the Narodnaya Volya is discussed in the 19th Century
sub-section. Other pre-Reign of Terror historical events sometimes associated
with terrorism are the Gunpowder Plot, an attempt to destroy the English
Parliament in 1605, and the Boston Tea Party, an attack on British property by
the Sons of Liberty in 1773, three years prior to the American Revolution.
During the 1st century AD, the Jewish Zealots in Judaea Province rebelled,
killing prominent collaborators with Roman rule. In 6 CE, according to
contemporary historian Josephus, Judas of Galilee formed a small and more
extreme offshoot of the Zealots, the Sicarii ("dagger men"). Their efforts also
directed against Jewish "collaborators," including temple priests, Sadducees,
Herodians, and other wealthy elites. According to Josephus, the Sicarii would
hide short daggers under their cloaks, mingle with crowds at large festivals,
murder their victims, and then disappear into the panicked crowds. Their most
successful assassination was of the high priest Jonathan. In the late 11th
century AD, the Hashshashin (a.k.a. the Assassins) arose, an offshoot of the
IsmƒÅ'ƒ´lƒ´ sect of Shia Muslims. Led by Hassan-i Sabbah and opposed to Fatimid
rule, the Hashshashin militia seized Alamut and other fortress strongholds
across Persia. Hashshashin forces were too small to challenge enemies
militarily, so they assassinated city governors and military commanders in
order to create alliances with militarily powerful neighbors. For example, they
killed Janah al-Dawla, ruler of Homs, to please Ridwan of Aleppo, and
assassinated Mawdud, Seljuk emir of Mosul, as a favor to the regent of
Damascus. The Hashshashin also carried out assassinations as retribution. Under
some definitions of terrorism, such assassinations do not qualify as terrorism,
since killing a political leader does not intimidate political enemies or
inspire revolt. 19th century. Terrorism was associated with the Reign of Terror
in France until the mid-19th century, when the term began to be associated with
non-governmental groups. Anarchism, often in league with rising nationalism,
was the most prominent ideology linked with terrorism. Attacks by various
anarchist groups led to the assassination of a Russian Tsar and a U.S.
President. In the 19th century, powerful, stable, and affordable explosives
were developed, and the gap closed between the firepower of the state and
dissidents. Dynamite, in particular, inspired American and French anarchists
and was central to their strategic thinking. In mid-19th century Russia, many
grew impatient with the slow pace of Tsarist reforms, and anarchists such as
Mikhail Bakunin maintained that progress was impossible without violence.
Founded in 1878 and inspired by Bakunin and others, Narodnaya Volya used
dynamite-packed bombs to kill Russian state officials, in an effort to incite
state retribution and mobilize the populace against the government. Inspired by
Narodnaya Volya, several nationalist groups in the ailing Ottoman Empire began
using violence against public figures in the 1890s. These included the
Hunchakian Revolutionary Party, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation, and the
Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO). The United States. In
the 1850s, John Brown (1800‚Äì1859) was an abolitionist who advocated and
practiced armed opposition to slavery. Brown led a series of attacks between
1856 and 1859, the most famous in 1859 against the armory at Harpers Ferry.
Local forces soon recaptured the fort and Brown was tried and executed for
treason. A biographer of Brown has written that his purpose was "to force the
nation into a new political pattern by creating terror." After the Civil War,
on December 24, 1865, six Confederate veterans created the Ku Klux Klan (KKK).
The KKK used violence, lynching, murder and acts of intimidation such as cross
burning to oppress in particular African Americans, and created a sensation
with its masked forays' dramatic nature. The group's politics are generally
perceived as white supremacy, anti-Semitism, racism, anti-Catholicism, and
nativism. A KKK founder boasted that it was a nationwide organization of
550,000 men and that it could muster 40,000 Klansmen within five days' notice,
but as a secret or "invisible" group with no membership rosters, it was
difficult to judge the Klan's actual size. The KKK has at times been
politically powerful, and at various times controlled the governments of
Tennessee, Oklahoma, and South Carolina, in addition to several legislatures in
the South. Europe. In 1867 the Irish Republican Brotherhood, a revolutionary
Irish nationalist group, carried out attacks in England. Writer Richard English
has referred to such attacks as the first acts of "republican terrorism," which
would became a recurrent feature of British and Irish history. The group is
considered a precursor to the Irish Republican Army. The first police unit to
combat terrorism Special Branch, or Special Irish Branch, as it was known, was
a unit of London's Metropolitan Police formed in March 1883 to combat the Irish
Republican Brotherhood. The name became Special Branch as the unit's remit
widened. Europeans invented the "Propaganda of the deed" (or "propaganda by the
deed," from the French "propagande par le fait") theory, a concept that
advocates physical violence or other provocative public acts against political
enemies in order to inspire mass rebellion or revolution. One of the first
individuals associated with this concept was the Italian revolutionary Carlo
Pisacane (1818‚Äì1857), who wrote in his "Political Testament" (1857) that
"ideas spring from deeds and not the other way around." Anarchist Mikhail
Bakunin (1814‚Äì1876), in his "Letters to a Frenchman on the Present Crisis"
(1870) stated that "we must spread our principles, not with words but with
deeds, for this is the most popular, the most potent, and the most irresistible
form of propaganda." The phrase itself was popularized by the French anarchist
Paul Brousse (1844‚Äì1912), who in 1877 cited as examples the 1871 Paris
Commune and a workers' demonstration in Berne provocatively using the socialist
red flag. By the 1880s, the slogan had begun to be used to refer to bombings,
regicides and tyrannicides. Reflecting this new understanding of the term,
Italian anarchist Errico Malatesta in 1895 described "propaganda by the deed"
(which he opposed the use of) as violent communal insurrections meant to ignite
an imminent revolution. Founded in Russia in 1878, Narodnaya Volya
("–ù–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–∞—è –í–æ–ª—è" in Russian; "People's Will" in English) was a
revolutionary anarchist group inspired by Sergei Nechayev and "propaganda by
the deed" theorist Pisacane. The group developed ideas‚Äîsuch as targeted
killing of the 'leaders of oppression'‚Äîthat were to become the hallmark of
subsequent violence by small non-state groups, and they were convinced that the
developing technologies of the age‚Äîsuch as the invention of dynamite, which
they were the first anarchist group to make widespread use of‚Äîenabled them to
strike directly and with discrimination. Attempting to spark a popular revolt
against Russia's Tsars, the group killed prominent political figures by gun and
bomb, and on March 13, 1881, assassinated Russia's Tsar Alexander II. The
assassination, by a bomb that also killed the Tsar's attacker, Ignacy
Hryniewiecki, failed to spark the expected revolution, and an ensuing crackdown
brought the group to an end. Individual Europeans also engaged in politically
motivated violence. For example, in 1893, Auguste Vaillant, a French anarchist,
threw a bomb in the French Chamber of Deputies in which one person was injured.
In reaction to Vaillant's bombing and other bombings and assassination
attempts, the French government passed a set of laws restricting freedom of the
press that were pejoratively known as the "lois sc√©l√©rates" ("villainous
laws"). From 1894 to 1896, President of France Marie Francois Carnot, Prime
Minister of Spain Antonio C√°novas del Castillo, and Austria-Hungary Empress
Elisabeth of Bavaria were killed by anarchists. The Ottoman Empire. Several
nationalist groups used violence against an Ottoman Empire in apparent decline.
One was the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (in Armenian "Dashnaktsuthium",
or "The Federation"), a revolutionary movement founded in Tiflis (Russian
Transcaucasia) in 1890 by Christopher Mikaelian. Many members had been part of
Narodnaya Volya or the Hunchakian Revolutionary Party. The group published
newsletters, smuggled arms, and hijacked buildings as it sought to bring in
European intervention that would force the Ottoman Empire to surrender control
of its Armenian territories. On August 24, 1896, 17-year-old Babken Suni led
twenty-six members in capturing the Imperial Ottoman Bank in Constantinople.
The group demanded European intervention to stop the Hamidian Massacres and the
creation of an Armenian state, but backed down on a threat to blow up the bank.
An ensuing security crackdown destroyed the group. Also inspired by Narodnaya
Volya, the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO) was a
revolutionary movement founded in 1893 by Hristo Tatarchev in the Ottoman-
controlled Macedonian territories. Through assassinations and by provoking
uprisings, the group sought to coerce the Ottoman government into creating a
Macedonian nation. On July 20, 1903, the group incited the Ilinden uprising in
the Ottoman villayet of Monastir. The IMRO declared the town's independence and
sent demands to the European Powers that all of Macedonia be freed. The demands
were ignored and Turkish troops crushed the 27,000 rebels in the town two
months later. Early 20th century. Revolutionary nationalism continued to
motivate political violence in the 20th century, much of it directed against
the British Empire. The Irish Republican Army campaigned against the British in
the 1910s and inspired the Zionist groups Hagannah, Irgun and Lehi to fight the
British throughout the 1930s in the Palestine mandate. Like the IRA and the
Zionist groups, the Muslim Brotherhood used bombings and assassinations to try
to free Egypt from British control. Europe. Political assassinations continued
into the 20th century, its first victim Umberto I of Italy, killed in July
1900. Political violence became especially widespread in Imperial Russia, and
several ministers were killed in the opening years of the century. The highest
ranking was prime minister Pyotr Stolypin, killed in 1911 by a leftist radical.
On June 28, 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, heir to the Austro-
Hungarian throne, and his wife, Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg, were shot and
killed in Sarajevo, capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina, by Gavrilo Princip, one
of a group of six assassins. The assassinations produced widespread shock
across Europe, setting in motion a series of events which led to World War I.
In an action called the Easter Rising or Easter Rebellion, on April 24, 1916,
members of the Irish Volunteers and Irish Citizen Army seized the Dublin
General Post Office and several other buildings, proclaiming an independent
Irish Republic. The rebellion failed militarily but was a success for physical
force Irish republicanism, leaders of the uprising becoming Irish heroes after
their eventual execution by the British government. Shortly after the
rebellion, Michael Collins and others founded the Irish Republican Army (IRA),
which from 1916 to 1923 carried out numerous attacks against symbols of British
power. For example, it attacked over 300 police stations simultaneously just
before Easter 1920, and, in November 1920, publicly killed a dozen police
officers and burned down the Liverpool docks and warehouses, an action that
came to be known as Bloody Sunday. After years of warfare, London agreed to the
1921 Anglo-Irish treaty creating a free Irish state encompassing 26 of the
island's 32 counties. IRA tactics were an inspiration to other groups,
including the Palestine Mandate's Zionists, and to British special operations
during World War II. Bedouins seized French planes during the 1920s. Middle
East. Following the 1929 Hebron massacre of sixty-seven Jewish settlers in the
British Mandate of Palestine, the Zionist settlers militia Haganah transformed
itself into a paramilitary force. In 1931, however, a more militant Irgun broke
away from Haganah, objecting to Haganah's policy of restraint toward Arabs
fighting Jewish settlers. Founded by Avraham Tehomi, Irgun sought to
aggressively defend Jews from Arab attacks. Its tactic of attacking Arab
communities, including the bombing a crowded Arab market, is considered among
the first examples of terrorism directed against civilians. After the British
restricted Jewish immigration to Palestine in 1939, the Irgun began a campaign
against Bitish rule by assassinating police, capturing British government
buildings and arms, and sabotaging British railways. Irgun's best known attack
was the 1946 bombing of the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, parts of which
housed the headquarters of the British civil and military administrations.
Ninety-one people were killed and forty-six injured in what was the most deadly
attack during the Mandate era. After the creation of Israel in 1948, Menachem
Begin (Irgun leader from 1943 to 1948) transformed the group into the political
party which later became part of Likud. Operating in the British Mandate of
Palestine in the 1930s, Izz ad-Din al-Qassam organized and established the
Black Hand, an anti-Zionist militia. He recruited and arranged military
training for peasants, and by 1935 had enlisted between 200 and 800 men. Al-
Qassam obtained a fatwa from Shaykh Badr al-Din al-Taji al-Hasani, the Mufti of
Damascus, authorizing armed resistance against the British and Jews of
Palestine. Black Hand cells were equipped with bombs and firearms, which they
used to kill Zionist settlers. Although al-Qassam's revolt was unsuccessful in
his lifetime, many organizations gained inspiration from his revolutionary
example. He became a popular hero and an inspiration to subsequent Arab
militants, who in the 1936-1939 Arab Revolt, called themselves Qassamiyun,
followers of al-Qassam. Lehi ("Lohamei Herut Yisrael", a.k.a. "Freedom Fighters
for Israel", a.k.a. Stern Gang) was a revisionist Zionist group that splintered
off from Irgun in 1940. Abraham Stern formed Lehi from disaffected Irgun
members after Irgun agreed to a truce with Britain in 1940. Lehi assassinated
prominent politicians as a strategy. For example, on November¬ 6,¬ 1944, Lord
Moyne, the British Minister of State for the Middle East, was assassinated. The
act was controversial among Zionist militant groups, Hagannah sympathizing with
the British and launching a massive man-hunt against members of Lehi and Irgun.
After Israel's 1948 founding, Lehi was formally dissolved and its members
integrated into the Israeli Defense Forces. Elsewhere. The first in-flight
skyjacking took place in 1931, when a plane was commandeered by antiregime
forces during a coup in Peru. World War II. The resistance movement in Europe.
Some of the tactics of the guerrilla, partisan, and resistance movements
organised and supplied by the Allies during World War II, according to
historian M.¬ R.¬ D.¬ Foot, can be considered terrorist. Colin Gubbins, a key
leader within the British Special Operations Executive (SOE), made sure the
organization drew much of its inspiration from the IRA. On the eve of D-Day,
the SOE organised with the French resistance the complete destruction of the
rail and communication infrastructure of western France perhaps the largest
coordinated attack of its kind in history. Allied supreme commander Dwight
Eisenhower later wrote that "the disruption of enemy rail communications, the
harassing of German road moves and the continual and increasing strain placed
on German security services throughout occupied Europe by the organised forces
of Resistance, played a very considerable part in our complete and final
victory". Mid-20th century. After World War II, largely successful anti-
colonial campaigns were launched against the collapsing European empires, as
many World War II resistance groups became militantly anti-colonial. The Viet
Minh, for example, which had fought against the Japanese, now fought the
returning French colonists. In the Middle East, the Muslim Brotherhood used
bombings and assassinations against British rule in Egypt. Also during the
1950s, the National Liberation Front (FLN) in French-controlled Algeria and the
EOKA in British-controlled Cyprus waged guerrilla and open war against colonial
powers. In the 1960s, inspired by Mao's Chinese revolution of 1949 and Castro's
Cuban revolution of 1959, national independence movements in formerly colonized
countries often fused nationalist and socialist impulses. This was the case
with Spain's ETA, the Front de lib√©ration du Qu√©bec, and the Palestine
Liberation Organization. In the late 1960s and 1970s violent leftist groups
were on the rise, sympathizing with Third World guerrilla movements and seeking
to spark anti-capitalist revolt. Such groups included the PKK in Turkey,
Armenia's ASALA, the Japanese Red Army, the German Red Army Faction, the
Italian Red Brigades, and, in the U.S., the Weather Underground. Nationalist
groups such as the Provisional IRA and the Tamil tigers also began operations
at this time. Throughout the Cold War, both the U.S. and the Soviet Union made
extensive use of violent nationalist organizations to carry on a war by proxy.
For example, Soviet and Chinese military advisers provided training and support
to the Viet Cong during the Vietnam War, while the U.S. funded groups such as
the Contras in Nicaragua. Ironically, many violent Islamic militants of the
late 20th and early 21st century had been funded in the 1980s by the US and the
UK because they were fighting the USSR in Afghanistan. Middle East. Founded in
1928 as a nationalist social-welfare and political movement in British-
controlled Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood in the late 1940s began to attack
British soldiers and police stations. Founded and led by Hassan al-Banna, it
also assassinated politicians seen as collaborating with British rule, most
prominently Egyptian Prime Minister Nuqrashi in 1948. British rule was
overthrown in a 1952 military coup, and shortly thereafter the Muslim
Brotherhood went underground in the face of a massive crackdown. Though
sometimes banned or otherwise oppressed, the group continues to exist in
present-day Egypt. The Front de Lib√©ration Nationale (FLN) was a nationalist
group founded in French-controlled Algeria in 1954. The group was a large-scale
resistance movement against French occupation, with alleged terrorism only part
of its operations. The FLN leadership was inspired by the Viet Minh rebels who
had made French troops withdraw from Vietnam. The FLN was one of the first
anti-colonial groups to use large scale compliance violence. The FLN would
establish control over a rural village and coerce its peasants to execute any
French loyalists among them. On the night of October¬ 31,¬ 1954, in a
coordinated wave of seventy bombings and shootings known as the Toussaint
attacks, the FLN attacked French military installations and the homes of
Algerian loyalists. In the following year, the group gained significant support
for an uprising against loyalists in Philippeville. This uprising ‚Äî and the
heavy-handed response by the French ‚Äî convinced many Algerians to support the
FLN and the independence movement. The FLN eventually secured Algerian
independence from France in 1962, and transformed itself into Algeria's ruling
party. Fatah was organized as a Palestinian nationalist group in 1954, and
exists today as a political party in Palestine. In 1967 it joined the Palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO), an umbrella organization for secular Palestinian
nationalist groups formed in 1964. The PLO began its own armed operations in
1965. Factions of the PLO have advocated or carried out acts of terrorism. Abu
Iyad organized the Fatah splinter group Black September in 1970; the group is
best known for seizing eleven Israeli athletes as hostages at the September
1972 Summer Olympics in Munich. All the athletes and five Black September
operatives died during a gun battle with the West German police, in what was
later known as the Munich massacre. The PFLP was founded in 1967 by George
Habash, and on September¬ 6,¬ 1970, the group hijacked three international
passenger planes, landing two of them in Jordan and blowing up the third. Fatah
leader and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat publicly renounced terrorism in
December¬ 1988 on behalf of the PLO, but Israel has stated it has proof that
Arafat continued to sponsor terrorism until his death in 2004. In the 1974
Ma'alot massacre 22¬ Israeli high school students, aged 14‚Äì16, from Safed
were killed by three members of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of
Palestine. Before reaching the school, the trio shot and killed two Arab women,
a Jewish man, his pregnant wife, and their 4 year old son, and wounded several
others. The People's Mujahedin of Iran (PMOI) or Mujahedin-e Khalq, is a
socialist Islamic group that has fought Iran's government since the Khomeini
revolution. The group was originally founded to oppose capitalism and what it
perceived as western exploitation of Iran under the Shah. The group would go on
to play an important role in the Shah's overthrow but was unable to capitalize
on this in the following power vacuum. The group is suspected of having a
membership of between 10,000 and 30,000. The group renounced violence in 2001
but remains a proscribed terror organization in Iran and the U.S. The EU,
however, has removed the group from its terror list. The PMOI is accused of
supporting other groups such as the Jundallah. The Armenian Secret Army for the
Liberation of Armenia (ASALA) was founded in 1975 in Beirut during the Lebanese
Civil War by Hagop Tarakchian and Hagop Hagopian with the help of sympathetic
Palestinians. At the time, Turkey was in political turmoil, and Hagopian
believed that the time was right to avenge the Armenians who died during the
Armenian Genocide and to force the Turkish government to cede the territory of
Wilsonian Armenia to establish a nation state also incorporating the Armenian
SSR. In its Esenboga airport attack, on 7¬ August¬ 1982, two ASALA rebels
opened fire on civilians in a waiting room at the Esenboga International
Airport in Ankara. Nine people died and 82 were injured. By 1986, the ASALA had
virtually ceased all attacks. The "Partiya Karker√™n Kurdistan" (Kurdistan
Workers Party or PKK) was established in Turkey in 1978 as a Kurdish
nationalist party. Founder Abdullah Ocalan was inspired by the Maoist theory of
people's war, and like Algeria's FLN he advocated the use of compliance terror.
The group seeks to create an independent Kurdish state consisting of parts of
south-eastern Turkey, north-eastern Iraq, north-eastern Syria and north-western
Iran. In 1984, the PKK transformed itself into a paramilitary organisation and
launched conventional attacks as well as bombings against Turkish governmental
installations. In 1999, Turkish authorities captured √ñcalan. He was tried in
Turkey and sentenced to life imprisonment. The PKK has since gone through a
series of name changes. Europe. Founded in 1959 and still active, the Euskadi
Ta Askatasuna (or ETA (Basque for "Basque Homeland and Freedom", pronounced ))
is an armed Basque nationalist separatist organization. Formed in response to
General Francisco Franco's suppression of the Basque language and culture, ETA
evolved from an advocacy group for traditional Basque culture into an armed
Marxist group demanding Basque independence. Many ETA victims are government
officials, the group's first known victim a police chief killed in 1968. In
1973 ETA operatives killed Franco's apparent successor, Admiral Luis Carrero
Blanco, by planting an underground bomb under his habitual parking spot outside
a Madrid church. In 1995, an ETA car bomb nearly killed Jose Maria Aznar, then
the leader of the conservative Popular Party, and the same year investigators
disrupted a plot to assassinate King Juan Carlos. Efforts by Spanish
governments to negotiate with the ETA have failed, and in 2003 the Spanish
Supreme Court banned the Batasuna political party, which was determined to be
the political arm of ETA. The Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) was an
Irish nationalist movement founded in December¬ 1969 when several militants
including Se√°n Mac St√≠of√°in broke off from the Official IRA and formed a new
organization. Led by Mac St√≠of√°in in the early 1970s and by a group around
Gerry Adams since the late 1970s, the Provisional IRA sought to create an all-
island Irish state. Between 1969 and 1997, during a period known as the
Troubles, the group conducted an armed campaign, including bombings, gun
attacks, assassinations and even a mortar attack on 10¬ Downing Street. On
July¬ 21,¬ 1972, in an attack later known as Bloody Friday, the group set off
twenty-two bombs, killing nine and injuring 130. On July¬ 28,¬ 2005, the
Provisional IRA Army Council announced an end to its armed campaign. The IRA is
believed to have been a major exporter of arms to and provided military
training to groups such as the FARC in Colombia and the PLO. In the case of the
latter there has been a long held solidarity movement, which is evident by the
many murals around Belfast. The Red Army Faction (RAF) was a New Leftist group
founded in 1968 by Andreas Baader and Ulrike Meinhof in West Germany. Inspired
by Che Guevara, Maoist socialism, and the Vietcong, the group sought to raise
awareness of the Vietnamese and Palestinian independence movements through
kidnappings, taking embassies hostage, bank robberies, assassinations,
bombings, and attacks on U.S. air bases. The group is best known for 1977's
"German Autumn". The buildup leading to German Autumn began on April¬ 7, when
the RAF shot Federal Prosecutor Siegfried Buback. On July¬ 30, it shot Jurgen
Ponto, then head of the Dresdner Bank, in a failed kidnapping attempt; on
September¬ 5, the group kidnapped Hanns Martin Schleyer (a former SS officer
and an important West German industrialist), executing him on October¬ 19. The
hijacking of the Lufthansa jetliner "Landshut" by the PFLP, a Palestinian
group, is also considered to be part of German Autumn. The Red Brigades were a
New Leftist group founded by Renato Curcio and Alberto Franceschini in 1970
that sought to create a revolutionary state. The group carried out a series of
bombings and kidnappings until Curcio and Franceschini were arrested in the
mid-1970s. Their successor as leader, Mario Moretti, led the group toward more
militarized and violent actions, including the kidnapping of former Prime
Minister Aldo Moro on March¬ 16,¬ 1978. Moro was killed 56¬ days later. This
led to an all-out assault on the group by Italian law enforcement and security
forces and condemnation from Italian left-wing radicals and even imprisoned ex-
leaders of the Brigades. The group lost most of its social support and public
opinion turned strongly against it. In 1984, the group split, the majority
faction becoming the Communist Combatant Party (Red Brigades-PCC) and the
minority faction reconstituting itself as the Union of Combatant Communists
(Red Brigades-UCC). Members of these groups carried out a handful of
assassinations before almost all were arrested in 1989. The Americas. The Front
de lib√©ration du Qu√©bec (FLQ) was a Marxist nationalist group that sought to
create an independent, socialist Quebec. Georges Schoeters founded the group in
1963 and was inspired by Che Guevara and Algeria's FLN. The group was accused
of bombings, kidnappings, and assassinations of politicians, soldiers, and
civilians. On October 5, 1970, the FLQ kidnapped James Richard Cross, the
British Trade Commissioner, and on October 10, the Minister of Labor and Vice-
Premier of Quebec, Pierre Laporte. Laporte was killed a week later. After these
events support for violence in order to attain Quebec independence declined,
and support increased for the Parti Qu√©b√©cois, which took power in Quebec in
1976. In Colombia several paramilitary and guerrilla groups formed during the
1960s and afterwards. In 1983, President Fernando Bela√∫nde Terry of Peru
described armed attacks on his nation's anti-narcotics police as
"narcoterrorism", i.e., which refers to "violence waged by drug producers to
extract political concessions from the government." Pablo Escobar's ruthless
violence in his dealings with the Colombian and Peruvian governments has been
probably one of the best known and best documented examples of narcoterrorism.
Paramilitary groups associated with narcoterrorism include the Ej√©rcito de
Liberaci√≥n Nacional (ELN), the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia
(FARC), and the Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia (AUC). While the ELN and FARC
were originally leftist revolutionary groups and the AUC was originally a
right-wing paramilitary, all have conducted numerous attacks on civilians and
civilian infrastructure, and the U.S. and some European governments consider
them terrorist organizations. The Jewish Defense League (JDL) was founded in
1969 by Rabbi Meir Kahane in New York City, with its declared purpose the
protection of Jews from harassment and antisemitism. Federal Bureau of
Investigation statistics state that, from 1980 to 1985, 15 attacks the FBI
classified as acts of terrorism were attempted in the U.S. by members of the
JDL. The National Consortium for the Study of Terror and Responses to Terrorism
states that, during the JDL's first two decades of activity, it was an "active
terrorist organization.". Kahane later founded the far-right Israeli political
party Kach, which was banned from elections in Israel on the ground of racism.
The JDL's present-day website condemns all forms of terrorism. The Fuerzas
Armadas de Liberaci√≥n Nacional (FALN, "Armed Forces of National Liberation")
is a nationalist group founded in Puerto Rico in 1974. Over the decade that
followed the group used bombings and targeted killings of civilians and police
in pursuit of an independent Puerto Rico. The FALN in 1975 took responsibility
for four nearly simultaneous bombings in New York City. The United States
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has classified the FALN as a terrorist
organization. The Weather Underground (a.k.a. the Weathermen) began as a
militant faction of the leftist Students for a Democratic Society (SDS)
organization, and in 1969 took over the organization. Weathermen leaders,
inspired by China's Maoists, the Black Panthers, and the 1968 student revolts
in France, sought to raise awareness of its revolutionary anti-capitalist and
anti-Vietnam War platform by destroying symbols of government power. From 1969
to 1974 the Weathermen bombed corporate offices, police stations, and
Washington government sites such as the Pentagon. After the end of the Vietnam
War in 1975, most of the group disbanded. Asia. The Japanese Red Army was
founded by Fusako Shigenobu in Japan in 1971 and attempted to overthrow the
Japanese government and start a world revolution. Allied with the Popular Front
for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), the group committed assassinations,
hijacked a commercial Japanese aircraft, and sabotaged a Shell oil refinery in
Singapore. On May 30, 1972, K≈çz≈ç Okamoto and other group members launched a
machine gun and grenade attack at Israel's Lod Airport in Tel Aviv, killing 26
people and injuring 80 others. Two of the three attackers then killed
themselves with grenades. Founded in 1976, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam, (also called "LTTE" or Tamil Tigers) was a militant Tamil nationalist
political and paramilitary organization based in northern Sri Lanka. From its
founding by Velupillai Prabhakaran, it waged a secessionist resistance campaign
that sought to create an independent Tamil state in the northern and eastern
regions of Sri Lanka. The conflict originated in measures the majority
Sinhalese took that were perceived as attempts to marginalize the Tamil
minority. The resistance campaign evolved into the Sri Lankan Civil War, one of
the longest-running armed conflicts in Asia. The group carried out many
bombings, including an April 21, 1987, car bomb attack at a Colombo bus
terminal that killed 110 people. In 2009 the Sri Lankan military launched a
major military offensive against the secessionist movement and claimed that it
had effectively destroyed the LTTE. Africa. Founded in 1961, Umkhonto we Sizwe
(MK) was the military wing of the African National Congress; it waged a
guerrilla campaign against the South African apartheid regime and was
responsible for many bombings. MK launched its first guerrilla attacks against
government installations on 16 December 1961. South Africa subsequently banned
the group after classifying it as a terrorist organization. MK's first leader
was Nelson Mandela, who was tried and imprisoned for the group's acts. With the
end of apartheid in South Africa, Umkhonto we Sizwe was incorporated into the
South African armed forces. Late 20th century. In the 1980s and 1990s, Islamic
militancy in pursuit of religious and political goals increased, many militants
drawing inspiration from Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution. In the 1990s, well-
known violent acts that targeted civilians were the Sarin gas attack on the
Tokyo subway by Aum Shinrikyo and the bombing of Oklahoma City's Murrah Federal
Building. This period also saw the rise of what is sometimes categorised as
Single issue terrorism. If terrorism is the extension of domestic politics by
other means, just as war is for diplomacy, then this represents the extension
of pressure groups into violent action. Notable examples that grow in this
period are Eco-terrorism and Anti-abortion terrorism. The Americas. The Contras
were a counter-revolutionary militia formed in 1979 to oppose Nicaragua's
Sandinista government. The Catholic Institute for International Relations
asserted the following about contra operating procedures in 1987: "The record
of the contras in the field... is one of consistent and bloody abuse of human
rights, of murder, torture, mutilation, rape, arson, destruction and
kidnapping." Americas Watch - subsequently folded into Human Rights Watch -
accused the Contras of targeting health care clinics and health care workers
for assassination; kidnapping civilians, torturing civilians; executing
civilians, including children, who were captured in combat; raping women;
indiscriminately attacking civilians and civilian houses; seizing civilian
property; and burning civilian houses in captured towns. The contras disbanded
after the election of Violetta Chamorro in 1990. In 1985, Air India Flight 182
flying from Canada was blown up by a bomb while in Irish airspace, killing 329
people, including 280 Canadian citizens, mostly of Indian birth or descent, and
22 Indians. The incident was the deadliest act of air terrorism before 9/11,
and the first bombing of a 747 Jumbo Jet which would set a pattern for future
air terrorism plots. The crash occurred within an hour of the fatal Narita
Airport Bombing which also originated from Canada without the passenger for the
bag that exploded on the ground. Evidence from the explosions, witnesses and
wiretaps of militants pointed to an attempt to actually blow up two airliners
simultaneously by members of the Babbar Khalsa Khalistan movement militant
group based in Canada to punish India for attacking the Golden Temple. The
April 19, 1995, Oklahoma City bombing was directed at the U.S. government,
according to the prosecutor at the murder trial of Timothy McVeigh, who was
convicted of carrying out the crime. The bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah
Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City claimed 168 lives and left over 800
injured. McVeigh, who was convicted of first degree murder and executed, said
his motivation was revenge for U.S. government actions at Waco and Ruby Ridge.
Middle East. Hezbollah ("Party of God") is an Islamist movement and political
party founded in Lebanon shortly after that country's 1982 civil war. Inspired
by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and the Iranian revolution, the group originally
sought an Islamic revolution in Lebanon and has long fought for the withdrawal
of Israeli forces from Lebanon. Led by Sheikh Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah since
1992, the group has kidnapped Israeli soldiers and carried out missile attacks
and suicide bombings against Israeli military and civilian targets. Between
1982 and 1986, there were 36 suicide attacks in Lebanon directed against
American, French and Israelis forces by 41¬ individuals with predominantly
leftist political beliefs and of both major religions, killing 659. The 1983
Beirut barracks bombing (by the Islamic Jihad Organization), which killed more
than 200¬ U.S. marines at their barracks in Beirut, was particularly deadly.
Hezbollah denied involvement in any of the attacks. Egyptian Islamic Jihad
(a.k.a. Al-Gamaa Al-Islamiyya) is a militant Egyptian Islamist movement
dedicated to the establishment of an Islamic state in Egypt. The group formed
in 1980 as an umbrella organization for militant student groups formed after
the leadership of the Muslim Brotherhood renounced violence. It is led by Omar
Abdel-Rahman, who has been accused of participation in the World Trade Center
1993 bombings. In 1981, the group assassinated Egyptian president Anwar Sadat.
On November¬ 17,¬ 1997, in what became known as the Luxor massacre, it attacked
tourists at the Temple of Hatshepsut (Deir el-Bahri); six men dressed as police
machine-gunned 58¬ Japanese and European vacationers and four Egyptians. On
December¬ 21,¬ 1988, Pan Am Flight¬ 103, a Pan American World Airways flight
from London's Heathrow International Airport to New York's John¬ F. Kennedy
International Airport, was destroyed mid flight over the Scottish town of
Lockerbie. On January¬ 31,¬ 2001, Libyan Abdelbaset al-Megrahi was convicted by
a panel of three Scottish judges of bombing the flight, and was sentenced to
27¬ years imprisonment. In 2002 Libya offered financial compensation to
victims' families in exchange for lifting of UN and U.S. sanctions. In 2007
Megrahi was granted leave to appeal against his conviction, and in August¬ 2009
was released on compassionate grounds by the Scottish executive due to his
terminal cancer. The first Palestinian suicide attack took place in 1989 when a
member of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad ignited a bomb onboard Tel Aviv bus,
killing 16 people. In the early 1990s another group, Hamas, also became well
known for suicide bombings. Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, Abdel Aziz al-Rantissi and
Mohammad Taha of the Palestinian wing of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood had created
Hamas in 1987, at the beginning of the First Intifada, an uprising against
Israeli rule in the Palestinian Territories that featured little deadly
violence. Hamas's militia, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, began its own
suicide bombings against Israel in 1993, eventually accounting for about 40% of
them. The Brigades ceased suicide attacks in 2005 and renounced them in April
2006. They have also been responsible for Israel-targeted rocket attacks, IED
attacks, and shootings, but reduced most of those operations by 2006. After
winning legislative elections, Hamas since June 2007 has governed the Gaza
portion of the Palestinian Territories. February 25, 1994, Baruch Goldstein, an
American-born Israeli physician, perpetrated the Cave of the Patriarchs
massacre in the city of Hebron, Goldstein shot and killed between 30 and 54
Muslim worshippers inside the Ibrahimi Mosque (within the Cave of the
Patriarchs), and wounded another 125 to 150. Goldstein, who was lynched and
killed in the mosque, was a supporter of Kach, an Israeli political party
founded by Rabbi Meir Kahane that advocated the expulsion of Arabs from Israel
and the Palestinian Territories. In the aftermath of the Goldstein attack and
Kach statements praising it, Kach was outlawed in Israel. Today, Kach and a
breakaway group, Kahane Chai, are considered terrorist organisations by Israel,
Canada, the European Union, and the United States. Asia. Aum Shinrikyo, now
known as Aleph, was a Japanese religious group founded by Shoko Asahara in 1984
as a yogic meditation group. Later, in 1990, Asahara and 24 other members
campaigned for election to the House of Representatives under the banner of
Shinri-t≈ç (Supreme Truth Party). None were voted in, and the group began to
militarize. Between 1990 and 1995, the group attempted several apparently
unsuccessful violent attacks using the methods of biological warfare, using
botulin toxin and anthrax spores. On June 28, 1994, Aum Shinrikyo members
released sarin gas from several sites in the Kaichi Heights neighborhood of
Matsumoto, Japan, killing eight and injuring 200 in what became known as the
Matsumoto incident. Seven months later, on March 20, 1995, Aum Shinrikyo
members released sarin gas in a coordinated attack on five trains in the Tokyo
subway system, killing 12 commuters and damaging the health of about 5,000
others in what became known as the subway sarin incident
(Âú∞‰∏ãÈâÑ„Çµ„É™„É≥‰∫ã‰ª∂, chikatetsu sarin jiken). In May 1995, Asahara and
other senior leaders were arrested and the group's membership rapidly
decreased. Europe. Chechnyan separatists, led by Shamil Basayev, carried out
several attacks on Russian targets between 1994 and 2006. In the June 1995
Budyonnovsk hospital hostage crisis, Basayev-led separatists took over 1,000
civilians hostage in a hospital in the southern Russian city of Budyonnovsk.
When Russian special forces attempted to free the hostages, 105 civilians and
25 Russian troops were killed. 21st century. Major events after the September
11 attacks in 2001 include the Moscow Theatre Siege, the 2003 Istanbul
bombings, the Madrid train bombings, the Beslan school hostage crisis, the 2005
London bombings, the October 2005 New Delhi bombings, the 2008 Mumbai Hotel
Siege, and the 2011 Norway attacks. Europe. The Moscow theatre hostage crisis
was the seizure of a crowded Moscow theatre on 23 October 2002 by some 40 to 50
armed Chechens who claimed allegiance to the Islamist militant separatist
movement in Chechnya. They took 850 hostages and demanded the withdrawal of
Russian forces from Chechnya and an end to the Second Chechen War. The siege
was officially led by Movsar Barayev. After a two-and-a-half day siege, Russian
Spetsnaz forces pumped an unknown chemical agent (thought to be fentanyl, 3-
methylfentanyl), into the building's ventilation system and raided it.
Officially, 39 of the attackers were killed by Russian forces, along with at
least 129 and possibly many more of the hostages (including nine foreigners).
All but a few of the hostages who died were killed by the gas pumped into the
theatre, and many condemned use of the gas as heavy handed. Roughly, 170 people
died in all. On September 1, 2004, in what became known as the Beslan school
hostage crisis, 32 Chechnyan separatists took 1,300 children and adults hostage
at Beslan's School Number One. When Russian authorities did not comply with the
rebel demands that Russian forces withdraw from Chechnya, 20 adult male
hostages were shot. After two days of stalled negotiations, Russian special
forces stormed the building. In the ensuing melee, over 300 hostages died,
along with 19 Russian servicemen and all but perhaps one of the rebels. Basayev
is believed to have participated in organizing the attack. Middle East. Osama
bin Laden, closely advised by Egyptian Islamic Jihad leader Ayman al-Zawahiri,
in 1988 founded Al-Qaeda (Arabic: ÿßŸÑŸÇÿßÿπÿØÿ©, meaning "The Base"), an
Islamic jihadist movement to replace Western-controlled or dominated Muslim
countries with Islamic fundamentalist regimes. In pursuit of that goal, bin
Laden issued a 1996 manifesto that vowed violent jihad against U.S. military
forces based in Saudi Arabia. On August 7, 1998, individuals associated with Al
Qaeda and Egyptian Islamic Jihad carried out simultaneous bombings of two U.S.
embassies in Africa which resulted in 224 deaths. On October 12, 2000, Al-Qaeda
carried out the USS Cole bombing, a suicide bombing of the U.S. Navy destroyer
USS Cole harbored in the Yemeni port of Aden. The bombing killed seventeen U.S.
sailors. The group's most well known attack, however, took place on September
11, 2001. On September 11, 2001, nineteen men affiliated with al-Qaeda hijacked
four commercial passenger jet airliners, crashing two of them into the World
Trade Center in New York City and one into the Pentagon. As a result of the
attacks, the World Trade Center's twin towers completely collapsed, and 2,973
victims and the 19 hijackers died. The United States responded to the attacks
by launching the War on Terror. Specifically, on October 7, 2001, it invaded
Afghanistan to depose the Taliban, which had harbored al-Qaeda terrorists. On
October 26, 2001, the U.S. enacted the Patriot Act, anti-terrorism legislation
that expanded the powers of U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies.
Many countries followed with similar legislation. On Israel's northern border,
after its unilateral withdrawal from southern Lebanon in May 2000, Hezbollah
launched numerous Katyusha rocket attacks against non-civilian and civilian
areas within northern Israel. Within Israel, the 1993‚Äì2008 Second Intifada
involved in part a series of suicide bombings against civilian and non-civilian
targets. A 2007 study of Palestinian suicide bombings from September 2000
through August 2005 found that 40% percent were carried out by Hamas's Izz ad-
Din al-Qassam Brigades, and roughly 26% by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ)
and Fatah militias. Also, between 2001 and January 2009, over 8,600 rocket
attacks were launched from the Gaza Strip were launched into civilian areas and
non-civilian areas inside Israel, causing deaths, injuries, and psychological
trauma. Formed in 2003, Jundallah is a Sunni insurgent group from the Baloch
region of Iran and neighboring Pakistan. It has committed numerous attacks
within Iran, stating that it is fighting for the rights of the Sunni minority
there. In 2005 the group attempted to assassinate Iran's president, Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad. The group takes credit for other bombings, including the 2007
Zahedan bombings. Iran and other sources accuse the group of being a front for
or supported by other nations, in particular the U.S. and Pakistan. Asia. The
2008 Mumbai attacks were more than ten coordinated shooting and bombing attacks
across Mumbai, India's largest city, by Islamic terrorists from Pakistan. The
attacks, which drew widespread condemnation across the world, began on 26
November 2008 and lasted until 29 November, killing at least 173 people and
wounding at least 308. Americas. 2001 also saw the first act of Bioterror with
the 2001 anthrax attacks when letters carrying anthrax spores were posted to
several major American media outlets and two Democratic politicians. There were
several fatalities.
