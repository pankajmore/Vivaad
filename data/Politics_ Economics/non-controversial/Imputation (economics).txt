Theory of imputation In economics, the theory of imputation, first expounded by
Carl Menger, maintains that factor prices are determined by output prices. This
is the opposite of the labor theory of value maintained by classical economists
such as Adam Smith and David Ricardo. The imputation theory was important
because it addressed the question of economic value. Marginalist economists
such as Carl Menger and Frank Fetter of the Austrian School maintained that
value was not made up of the factors that made up a good; instead, it was made
up of the most valuable use that the last unit of the good could be put
to—the marginal utility of the finished good. While it was easy to maintain
that this was the value of goods consumed by the end user (lower-order goods),
it was harder to make this case for higher-order goods which had no end user
and merely went into the making of lower-order goods. In effect, higher-order
goods do have end users, the manufacturers of lower-order goods. It was these
people whose marginal utility decided the factor prices, and their products
were valued on their marginal utility to the end users. Thus the factors of
production were as sensitive to marginal utility as consumer goods themselves.
