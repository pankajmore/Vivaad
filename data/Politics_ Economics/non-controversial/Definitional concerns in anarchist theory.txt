Issues in anarchism Anarchism is generally defined as the political philosophy
which holds the state to be undesirable, unnecessary, and harmful, or
alternatively as opposing authority and hierarchical organization in the
conduct of human relations. Proponents of anarchism, known as "anarchists",
advocate stateless societies based on non-hierarchical voluntary associations.
There are many philosophical differences among anarchists concerning questions
of ideology, values, and strategy. Ideas about how anarchist societies should
work vary considerably, especially with respect to economics. There are also
disagreements about how such a society might be brought about, with some
anarchists being committed to a strategy of nonviolence, while others advocate
armed struggle. Definitional concerns. Anarchist schools of thought encompass
not only a range of individual schools, but also a considerable divergence in
the use of some key terms. Some terms, such as "socialism", have been subject
to multiple definitions and ideological struggle throughout the period of the
development of anarchism. Others, such as "capitalism" are used in divergent,
and often contradictory, ways by different schools within the tradition. In
addition, terms such as "mutualism" have changed their meanings over time,
without spawning new schools. All of these terminological difficulties
contribute to misunderstandings within and about anarchism. A central concern
is whether the term "anarchism" is defined in opposition to hierarchy,
authority, the state or state "and" capitalism. Debates over the meaning of the
term emerge from the fact that it refers to both an abstract philosophical
position and to intellectual, political and institutional traditions, all of
which have been fraught with conflict. Some minimal, abstract definitions
encourage the inclusion of figures, movements and philosophical positions which
have historically positioned themselves outside, or even in opposition to,
individuals and traditions that have identified themselves as "anarchist."
Anti-capitalism is considered a necessary element of anarchism by most
anarchists, while anarcho-capitalists naturally disagree. The conflict arises
from some combination of genuine differences of opinion on the merits of market
economies, differing definitions of "capitalism," and the "package deal"
character of some definitions. Usages in political circles have varied
considerably. In 1894, Richard Ely noted that the term had "already acquired a
variety of meanings." These included, in its most general sense, the view that
society is "a living, growing organism, the laws of which are something
different from the laws of individual action." Several years earlier, in 1888,
the individualist anarchist Benjamin R. Tucker included the full text of a
"Socialistic Letter" by Ernest Lesigne in his essay on "State Socialism and
Anarchism." According to Lesigne, there are two socialisms, and "One is
dictatorial, the other libertarian." Ends and means. Among anarchists, there is
no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence in revolutionary
struggle. Mikhail Bakunin, Peter Kropotkin, Emma Goldman and Errico Malatesta,
for example, wrote of violence as a necessary and sometimes desirable force in
revolutionary settings. At the same time, they denounced acts of individual
terrorism. (Bakunin, "The Program of the International Brotherhood" (1869) and
Malatesta, "Violence as a Social Factor" (1895)). Other anarchists such as Leo
Tolstoy, Dorothy Day, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and Henry David Thoreau have
been advocates of pacifism. Anarchists have often been portrayed as dangerous
and violent, possibly due to a number of high-profile violent actions,
including riots, assassinations, insurrections, and terrorism committed by some
anarchists as well as persistently negative media portrayals. Late 19th-century
revolutionaries encouraged acts of political violence, called "propaganda of
the deed", such as bombings and the assassinations of heads of state to further
anarchism. However, the term originally referred to exemplary forms of direct
action meant to inspire the masses to revolution. Propaganda of the deed may be
violent or nonviolent. While all anarchists consider antimilitarism (opposition
to war) to be inherent to their philosophy, anarcho-pacifists take this
further, following Tolstoy's belief in pacifism. Although numerous anarchist
initiatives have been based on the tactic of nonviolence (Earth First!, Food
Not Bombs, etc.), many anarchists reject pacifism as an ideology, instead
supporting a "diversity of tactics." Authors Ward Churchill ("Pacifism as
Pathology", 1986), Peter Gelderloos ("How Nonviolence Protects the State",
2005), and Derrick Jensen ("Endgame", 2006) have published influential books
critical of pacifist doctrine, which they view as ineffectual and hypocritical.
In a 2010 article, author Randall Amster argued for the development of a
"complementarity of tactics" to bridge the pacifist and more militant aspects
of anarchism. As a result of anarchism's critical view of certain types of
private property, many anarchists see the destruction of property as an
acceptable form of violence or argue that it is not, in fact, violence at all.
In her widely cited 1912 essay, "Direct Action", Voltairine de Cleyre drew on
American historical events, including the destroying of revenue stamps and the
Boston Tea Party, as a defense of such activities. Many anarchists participate
in subversive organizations as a means to undermine the establishment, such as
Food Not Bombs, radical labor unions, alternative media, and radical social
centers. This is in accordance with the anarchist ideal that governments are
intrinsically evil: only by destroying the power of governments can individual
freedoms and liberties be preserved. Some anarchist schools, however, in theory
adopt the concept of Dual Power: creating the structures for a new anti-
authoritarian society in the shell of the old, hierarchical one. Participation
in statist democracy. While most anarchists firmly oppose voting, or otherwise
participating in the State institution, there are a few that disagree. The
prominent anarchist, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, stood for election to the French
Constituent Assembly twice in 1848. Paul Brousse developed the concept of
libertarian municipalism in Switzerland in the 1890s which involved
participating in local elections. Many anarchists oppose voting for three
reasons. First, they believe it to be ineffective, at best resulting in minor
reforms. Second, taking part in elections has historically resulted in radicals
becoming part of the system they oppose rather than ending it. Third, because
some claim voting amounts to an acknowledgment of the state's legitimacy. Most
fundamental is the idea that "representative" democracy itself is fundamentally
flawed. In essence, the state uses the theory that it is democratic to gain
power over the populace, and then uses force to suppress any dissent.
Nonetheless, the state in reality almost never serves the interests of the
populace in general, but simply produces the illusion that it does this solely
to gain power. Governments operate at the expense of the public good, and can
serve no other purpose regardless of whatever form they take. During the 2004
US Presidential election, the anarchist collective CrimethInc. launched "Don't
Just Vote, Get Active," a campaign promoting the importance of direct action,
rather than electoral change. Anarchists in other countries often engage in
similar anti-voting campaigns. Others advocate a more pragmatic approach,
including voting in referenda, while other prominent anarchists like Howard
Zinn and Noam Chomsky have pledged their support for progressive candidates
such as Ralph Nader. The individualist anarchist Lysander Spooner argued that
voting was a legitimate means of self-defense against the state, and noted that
many supporters of the state consider "both" voting and abstention to be
acknowledgments of the state's legitimacy. Spooner's essay "No Treason" offers
an individualist anarchist rebuttal to the argument that existing democratic
governments are justified by majority consent. Democracy in anarchism. For
individualist anarchists, "the system of democracy, of majority decision, is
held null and void. Any impingement upon the natural rights of the person is
unjust and a symbol of majority tyranny." Libertarian municipalist Murray
Bookchin criticized individualist anarchists for opposing democracy, and said
"majority rule" is consistent with anarchism, but he also preferred the term
assembly rather than democracy. Bookchin has in turn been accused of "municipal
statism"; i.e., non-anarchism. Later, Bookchin renounced anarchism to identify
himself as an advocate of Communalism. Violence and non-violence. Anarchists
have often been portrayed as dangerous and violent, due mainly to a number of
high-profile violent acts including riots, assassinations, and insurrections
involving anarchists. The use of terrorism and assassination, however, is
condemned by most anarchist ideology, though there remains no consensus on the
legitimacy or utility of violence. Some anarchists have opposed coercion, while
others have supported it, particularly in the form of violent revolution on the
path to anarchy or utopia. Some anarchists share Leo Tolstoy's Christian
anarchist belief in nonviolence. These anarcho-pacifists advocate nonviolent
resistance as the only method of achieving a truly anarchist revolution. They
often see violence as the basis of government and coercion and argue that, as
such, violence is illegitimate, no matter who is the target. Some of Proudhon's
French followers even saw strike action as coercive and refused to take part in
such traditional socialist tactics. Other anarchists advocate Marshall
Rosenberg's Nonviolent Communication that relates to peoples fundamental needs
and feelings using strategies of requests, observations and empathy yet
providing for the use of protective force while rejecting pacifism as a
compromising strategy of the left that just perpetuates violence. Other
anarchists, such as Mikhail Bakunin and Errico Malatesta saw violence as a
necessary and sometimes desirable force. Malatesta took the view that it is
"necessary to destroy with violence, since one cannot do otherwise, the
violence which denies means of life and for development to the workers"
("UmanitÃ  Nova", number 125, September 6, 1921). Such "propaganda of the deed"
was not popular among anarchists, and many in the movement condemned the
tactic. For example, McKinley's assassin, Leon Czolgosz, claimed to be a
disciple of Emma Goldman, but she disavowed any association with him. Goldman
included in her definition of anarchism the observation that all governments
rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed.
Goldman herself didn't oppose tactics like assassination until she went to
Russia, where she witnessed the violence of the Russian state and the Red Army.
From then on she condemned the use of terrorism, especially by the state, and
advocated violence only as a means of self-defense. Depictions in the press and
popular fiction (for example, a malevolent bomb-throwing anarchist in Joseph
Conrad's "The Secret Agent") helped create a lasting public impression that
anarchists are violent terrorists. This perception was enhanced by events such
as the Haymarket Riot, where anarchists were blamed for throwing a bomb at
police who came to break up a public meeting in Chicago. More recently,
anarchists have been involved in protests against World Trade Organization
(WTO) and International Monetary Fund (IMF) meetings across the globe, which
the media has described as violent or riots. Traditionally, May Day in London
has also been a day of marching, but in recent years the Metropolitan Police
have warned that a "hardcore of anarchists" are intent on causing violence.
Anarchists often respond that it is the police who initiate violence at these
demonstrations, with anarchists who are otherwise peaceful sometimes forced to
defend themselves. The anarchists involved in such protests often formed "black
blocs" at these protests and some engaged in property destruction, vandalism,
or in violent conflicts with police, though others stuck to non-violent
principles. Those participating in black blocs distinguish between "violence"
and "property destruction": they claim that violence is when a person inflicts
harm to another person, while property destruction or property damage is not
violence, although it can have indirect harm such as financial harm. Most
anarchists do not consider the destruction of property to be violent, as do
most activists who believe in non-violence. Pacifism. Most anarchists consider
pacifism (opposition to war) to be inherent in their philosophy. Some
anarchists take it further and follow Leo Tolstoy's belief in non-violence
(note, however, that these anarcho-pacifists are not necessarily Christian
anarchists as Tolstoy was), advocating non-violent resistance as the only
method of achieving a truly anarchist revolution. Anarchist literature often
portrays war as an activity in which the state seeks to gain and consolidate
power, both domestically and in foreign lands. Many anarchists subscribe to
Randolph Bourne's view that "war is the health of the state". Anarchists
believe that if they were to support a war they would be strengthening the
stateâ€“ indeed, Peter Kropotkin was alienated from other anarchists when he
expressed support for the British in World War I. Just as they are critical and
distrustful of most government endeavors, anarchists often view the stated
reasons for war with a cynical eye. Since the Vietnam War protests in North
America and, most recently, the protests against the war in Iraq, much
anarchist activity has been anti-war based. Many anarchists in the current
movement however, reject complete pacifism, (although groups like Earth First!,
and Food Not Bombs are based on principles of non-violence), and instead are in
favor of self-defense, and sometimes violence against oppressive and
authoritarian forces which they in fact also consider as defensive violence.
Anarchists are skeptical however of winning a direct armed conflict with the
state, and instead concern themselves mostly with organizing. Individualism vs.
collectivism. While some anarchists favour collective property or no property,
others, such as some individualist anarchists of historical note (e.g.,
Benjamin Tucker and Lysander Spooner) support private property. Tucker argues
that collectivism in property is absurd: "That there is an entity known as the
community which is the rightful owner of all land, Anarchists
deny...I...maintain that â€˜the communityâ€™ is a non-entity, that it has no
existence..." He was particularly adamant in his opposition to "communism,"
even to the point of asserting that those who opposed private property were not
anarchists: "Anarchism is a word without meaning, unless it includes the
liberty of the individual to control his product or whatever his product has
brought him through exchange in a free marketâ€“ that is, private property.
Whoever denies private property is of necessity an Archist." However, some of
these individuals opposed property titles to unused land. Identity politics.
Gender. Early French feminists such as Jenny d'HÃ©ricourt and Juliette Adam
criticised the misogyny in the anarchism of Proudhon during the 1850s. Anarcha-
feminism is a kind of radical feminism that espouses the belief that patriarchy
is a fundamental problem in society. However, it was not explicitly formulated
as "anarcha-feminism" until early 1970s, during the second-wave feminist
movement. Anarcha-feminism views patriarchy as the first manifestation of
hierarchy in human history; thus, the first form of oppression occurred in the
dominance of male over female. Anarcha-feminists then conclude that if
feminists are against patriarchy, they must also be against all forms of
hierarchy, and therefore must reject the authoritarian nature of the state and
capitalism. Early first-wave feminist Mary Wollstonecraft held proto-anarchist
views, and William Godwin is often considered a feminist anarchist precursor.
While most anarchists of the period did not take these ideas seriously, others,
such as Florence Finch Kelly and Moses Harman held gender equality as a topic
of significant importance. Anarcha-feminism garnered further attention through
the work of early 20th-century authors and theorists including Emma Goldman and
Voltairine de Cleyre. In the Spanish Civil War, an anarcha-feminist group,
Mujeres Libres (), organized to defend both anarchist and feminist ideas.
Unlike marxist feminism and socialist feminism, anarcha-feminism does not
necessarily adopt the historical model of patriarchy put across by Engels in
The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State. Rather, anarcha-
feminists are likely to view patriarchy as a component and symptom of
interconnected systems of oppression. In such a model, opposition to patriarchy
is not the sole means of opposing authoritarian repression, but instead becomes
a key component of a movement opposing all interconnected forms of oppression.
Anarcho-primitivists see the creation of gender roles and patriarchy as a
creation of the start of civilization, and therefore consider primitivism to
also be an anarchist school of thought that addresses feminist concerns. Eco-
feminism, although not exclusively anarchist, is often considered a feminist
variant of green anarchist feminist thought. In anarcha-feminist circles in the
United States, the slang term "manarchist" is sometimes used, pejoratively, to
describe male anarchists who are either inattentive to or dismissive of
(anarcha)feminist concerns. Race. Black anarchism opposes the existence of a
state, capitalism, and subjugation and domination of people of color, and
favors a non-hierarchical organization of society. Theorists include Ashanti
Alston, Lorenzo Komboa Ervin, and Sam Mbah. Some of these theorists have had
past experiences with the Black Panther Party, and came to anarchism after they
became critical of the Black Panther Party's brand of Marxist-Leninism.
Anarchist People of Color, (or APOC), was created as a forum for non-Caucasian
anarchists to express their thoughts about racial issues within the anarchist
movement, particularly within the United States. Anti-Racist Action is not an
anarchist group, but many anarchists are involved. It focuses on publicly
confronting anti-Semites, racists, supremacists and others, such as the KKK,
neo-Nazi groups, etc. Most modern and historical anarchists describe themselves
as anti-racists. Many early Anarchists, notably Lucy Parsons - a person of
color and formerly an enslaved American - viewed Racism as one of many negative
side-effects of Capitalism and expected that it would vanish in a post-
capitalist world. Among modern Anarchists, however, anti-racism plays a more
prominent role and racism is typically viewed as one of several forms of social
hierarchy and stratification which must be destroyed. No anarchist
organizations has ever included racism as part of its platform, and many,
particularly modern formations, include explicit anti-racism. For instance
American Anarchists were alone in opposing racism against Chinese and Mexican
workers in the late 19th century and early 20th century. Since the late 1970s
anarchists have been involved in fighting the rise of neo-fascist groups. In
Germany and the United Kingdom some anarchists worked within militant anti-
fascist groups alongside members of the Marxist left. They advocated directly
combating fascists with physical force rather than relying on the state. Since
the late 1990s, a similar tendency has developed within US anarchism. "See
also: Anti-Racist Action (US), Anti-Fascist Action (UK/Europe), Antifa" Anti-
Racist Action is one of the largest grassroots anti-fascist and anti-racist
organizations in North America today and counts many anarchists among its
members. Their tactics, centered around directly confronting neo-fascist and
white-supremacist groups, are considered controversial both within the
anarchist movement (where they are sometimes portrayed as well-intentioned but
ineffective) and in mainstream society (where they are often portrayed as
violent and disruptive). Many anarchists also oppose the concept of race itself
on that basis that it has no biological basis and is a social construction
designed to divide the working class and preserve capitalism. Black anarchism
opposes the existence of a state, capitalism, and subjugation and domination of
people of African descent, and favours a non-hierarchical organization of
society. Theorists include Ashanti Alston, Lorenzo Komboa Ervin, Sam Mbah,
Aragorn! and Martin Sostre. Anarchist People of Color emerged in the United
States as a tendency which theorized anarchism in the broader context of race.
Founded by writer and organizer Ernesto Aguilar, an APOC email list became the
basis for collectives composed of people of colour to form in several American
cities. APOC held a conference in Detroit, Michigan in 2003. In 2005, the first
APOC journal, Wildfire, was launched, but folded a few months later. In 2007,
Roger White and the Oakland, California APOC group founded Jailbreak Press
blog. [http://www.jailbreakpress.org] A minority of historically prominent
anarchists have been accused of racism: e.g. Proudhon and Bakunin. A major area
of conflict amongst anarchists is how honest to be about the racism which has
existed within the anarchist movement since the days of Proudhon and Bakunin
who were both noted Eurocentrists and anti-semites. Some anarchists dismiss
this as being completely unimportant, suggesting for instance that racism was
commonly accepted at the time. Other anarchists simply prefer to ignore the
issue on the grounds that anarchism, unlike ideologies such as Marxism, is not
defined by individual theorists, but by the concepts they developed, thus
rendering perceived personal failings of individual theorists irrelevant to
anarchism generally. Religion. From Proudhon and Bakunin to the Spanish
anarcho-syndicalists, most anarchists have questioned or opposed organized
religion, believing that most organized religions are hierarchical or
authoritarian and, more often than not, aligned with contemporary power
structures like the state and capital. Nonetheless, others reconcile anarchism
with religion. Christian anarchists believe that there is no higher authority
than God, and oppose earthly authority such as government and established
churches. They believe that Jesus' teachings and the practice of the early
church were clearly anarchistic. Some of them feel that the teachings of the
Nazarenes and other early groups of followers were corrupted by contemporary
religious views - most notably when Constantine I declared "Christianity" to be
the official religion of Rome. Christian anarchists, who follow Jesus'
directive to "turn the other cheek", are usually strict pacifists, although
some believe in a limited justification of defense, especially defense of
others. The most famous advocate of Christian anarchism was Leo Tolstoy, author
of "The Kingdom of God is Within You", who called for a society based on
compassion, nonviolent principles and freedom. Christian anarchists tend to
form experimental communities (such as the Catholic Worker). They also
occasionally resist taxation. Buddhist anarchism originated in the influential
Chinese anarchist movement of the 1920s. Taixu, one of the leading thinkers and
writers of this school, was deeply influenced by the work of Christian
anarchists like Tolstoy and by the ancient Chinese well-field system. Buddhist
anarchism was later revived in the 1960s by writers such as Gary Snyder; an
incarnation of this school of thought was popularized by Jack Kerouac in his
book "The Dharma Bums". Neopaganism, with its focus on the environment and
equality, along with its often decentralized nature, has led to a number of
neopagan anarchists. One of the most prominent is Starhawk, who writes
extensively about both spirituality and activism. In the late 19th century the
Ghadar movement in India (see Har Dayal), influenced by Buddhist thought and by
Swami Dayananda Saraswati (founder of Arya Samaj), saw anarchism as a way of
propagating the ancient culture of the Arya (not to be confused with the much
later appropriation of "Aryan" identity by German National Socialists).
Discussing the anarchist movement in Britain in 2002, Adam K. has argued that
it "has an especially ignorant and hegemonistic perception of the Muslim
community", which he attributed to "the anglo-centric nature of the movement".
Quoting the statement that "Islam is an enemy of all freedom loving people"
from an anarchist magazine, he argues that this is "no different to the bigoted
rhetoric of George Bush or even BNP leader Nick Griffin." Capitalism.
Throughout most of its history, anarchism has been defined by its proponents in
opposition to capitalism - which they believe can be maintained only by state
violence. Most non-capitalist anarchists follow Proudhon in opposing ownership
of workplaces by capitalists and aim to replace wage labour with workers'
associations. These anarchists agree with Kropotkin's comment that ""the origin
of the anarchist inception of societyâ€¦ in the criticismâ€¦ of the
hierarchical organisations and the authoritarian conceptions of society""
rather than in simple opposition to the state or government. They argue that
the wage system is hierarchical and authoritarian in nature and, consequently,
capitalism cannot be anarchist. "There are three forms of usury, interest on
money, rent on land and houses, and profit in exchange. Whoever is in receipt
of any of these is a usurer." in Men against the State by James J. Martin,
p.Â 208 Excluding these, however, they tended to support free trade, free
competition, and varying levels of private property such as mutualism and
homesteading. It is this distinction which has led to the rift between
anarchism and anarcho-capitalism. The self-proclaimed descendents of such
theorists, variously called anarcho-capitalists, free-market anarchists, or
simply individualist anarchists, support laissez-faire free market capitalism.
Historically, anarchists considered themselves socialists and opposed to
capitalism. Thus, anarcho-capitalism is considered by many anarchists today as
not being true anarchism. Anarchist organisations, for example the CNT (Spain)
and the Anarchist Federation (Britain and Ireland), generally take an
explicitly anti-capitalist stance. In the 20th century, several economists
began to formulate a form of radical American libertarianism known as anarcho-
capitalism. This has met resistance from those who hold that capitalism is
inherently oppressive or statist; many anarchists and scholars don't consider
anarcho-capitalism to properly cohere with the spirit, principles, or history
of anarchism. However, other anarchists and scholars regard anarchism as
referring only to opposition to the non-privatisation of all aspects of the
state, and thus do consider anarcho-capitalism to be a form of anarchism.
Globalization. Many anarchists are actively involved in the anti-globalization
movement, seeing corporate globalization as a neocolonialist attempt to use
economic coercion on a global scale, carried out through state institutions
such as the World Bank, World Trade Organization, Group of Eight, and the World
Economic Forum. Globalization is an ambiguous term that has different meanings
to different anarchist factions. Many anarchists use the term to mean
neocolonialism and/or cultural imperialism (which they may see as related).
Others, particularly anarcho-capitalists, use "globalization" to mean the
worldwide expansion of the division of labor and trade, which they see as
beneficial so long as governments do not intervene. Market anarchists and
anarcho-capitalists see the worldwide expansion of the division of labor
through trade ("globalization") as a boon, but oppose the regulation and
cartelization imposed by the World Bank, World Trade Organization (WTO), etc.
and "managed trade" agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA) and the Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA]). Many also object
to fiat money issued by central banks and resulting debasement of money and
confiscation of wealth. Groups such as Reclaim the Streets, were among the
instigators of the so-called anti-globalization movement. The Carnival Against
Capitalism on 18 June 1999 is generally regarded as the first of the major
anti-globalization protests. Anarchists, such as the WOMBLES, have on occasion
played a significant role in planning, organising, and participating in
subsequent protests. The protests tended to be organised on anarchist direct
action principles with a general tolerance for a range of different activities
ranging from those who engage in tactical frivolity to the black blocs.
Nationalism. Anarchism has a long history of opposing imperialism, both in the
core nations (the colonizers) and the periphery nations (the colonized). In
general, anarchists have preferred to focus on building revolutions at home and
doing solidarity work for comrades in other countries, e.g., Guy Aldred was
jailed for printing Shyamji Krishnavarma's'"The Indian Sociologist". Another
example of this was Rudolf Rocker, a prominent German anarchist and anti-
fascist, who was particularly active amongst Jewish workers. In his
"Nationalism and Culture" he argued for a "federation of European peoples"
which would include Jews. Rejecting biological theories of race, and rejecting
the concept of nation, he argued that since it was European States that had
conquered and colonized the rest of the world, successful libertarian
organization amongst Europeans was "the first condition for the creation of a
world federation, which will also secure the so-called colonial peoples the
same rights for the pursuit of happiness" (p554). Many modern anarchists and
other anti-imperialists share this approach. Chinese anarchists were very
active in the early Chinese nationalist movement and in the resistance to
British and later Japanese colonization of China. Anarchists were also deeply
involved in anti-imperialist nationalist movements in Vietnam, Korea, Cuba,
Ukraine, Ireland, Mexico, and all over Africa. Anarchism is also an influence
in the modern Indigenist movement. The environment. The environment and
sustainability have been an issue for anarchists from at least as far back as
Kropotkin's 1899 book "Fields, Factories and Workshops", but since the late
1970s anarchists in Anglosphere and European countries have been agitating for
the natural environment. Eco-anarchists or green anarchists often embrace deep
ecology. This is a worldview that strives to cultivate biodiversity and
sustainability. Eco-anarchists often use direct action against what they see as
earth-destroying institutions. Of particular importance is the Earth First!
movement, that takes action such as tree sitting. The more militant Earth
Liberation Front, which grew out of Earth First!, also has connections with the
anarchist movement. Another important component is ecofeminism, which sees the
domination of nature as a metaphor for the domination of women. Murray
Bookchin's work on social ecology, David Watson's work with Fifth Estate
magazine, Steve Booth's work in the UK publication "Green Anarchist", and
Graham Purchase's writings on green syndicalism have all contributed to the
broad variety and scope of green anarchist/eco-anarchist thought and action.
Green anarchism also involves a critique of industrial capitalism, and, for
some green anarchists, civilization itself. Most anarchists see class society
as being the root cause of pollution. They argue that a small class of owners
or controllers have the wealth to avoid the worst repercussions of pollution
while a very much larger class of workers without such wealth have no say in
the running of the . Thus under capitalism and other class societies those who
control workplaces are also those with the least interest in minimising
pollution - indeed as most anti-pollution measures add to costs that class will
have an interest in minimising such measures. Under capitalism pollution is
often a product of externalising costs - that is a transfer of a pollutant from
the property of the owner to a public river transfers the cost from the
capitalist to society at large. The anarchist communist solution is to ensure
that all those working and living within the ecosystem of a plant have control
over all its outputs, including pollutants. Primitivism is a predominantly
Western philosophy that advocates a return to a pre-industrial and usually pre-
agricultural society. It develops a critique of industrial civilization. In
this critique technology and development have alienated people from the natural
world. This philosophy develops themes present in the political action of the
Luddites and the writings of Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Primitivism developed in
the context of the Reclaim the Streets, Earth First! and the Earth Liberation
Front movements. John Zerzan wrote that civilizationâ€“ not just the stateâ€“
would need to fall for anarchy to be achieved. Anarcho-primitivists point to
the anti-authoritarian nature of many 'primitive' or hunter-gatherer societies
throughout the world's history as examples of anarchist societies. Relations
with the Left. While many anarchists (especially those involved in the anti-
globalization movement) continue to see themselves as a leftist movement, some
thinkers and activists believe it is necessary to re-evaluate anarchism's
relationship with the traditional Left. Like many radical ideologies, most
anarchist schools of thought are, to some degree, sectarian. There is often a
difference of opinion "within" each school about how to react to, or interact
with, other schools. Many anarchists however, draw from a wide range of
political perspectives, such as the Zapatista Army of National Liberation, the
Situationists, "ultra leftists", Autonomist Marxism, various indigenous
cultures. A movement called post-left anarchy seeks to distance itself from the
traditional "left" - Communists, socialists, social democrats, etc. - and to
escape the confines of ideology in general. Post-leftists argue that anarchism
has been weakened by its long attachment to contrary "leftist" movements and
single issue causes (anti-war, anti-nuclear, etc.). It calls for a synthesis of
anarchist thought and a specifically anti-authoritarian revolutionary movement
outside of the leftist milieu. Important groups and individuals associated with
post-left anarchy include: CrimethInc., the magazine "" and its editor Jason
McQuinn, Bob Black, Hakim Bey and others. The term postanarchism was originated
by Saul Newman, first receiving popular attention in his book "From Bakunin to
Lacan", a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and poststructuralist
thought. Subsequent to Newman's use of the term, however, it has taken on a
life of its own and a wide range of ideas including autonomism, post-left
anarchy, situationism, post-colonialism and Zapatismo. By its very nature post-
anarchism rejects the idea that it should be a coherent set of doctrines and
beliefs. Nonetheless key thinkers associated with post-anarchism include Saul
Newman, Todd May, Gilles Deleuze and FÃ©lix Guattari. Some activists, calling
themselves "insurrectionary anarchists", are critical of formal anarchist labor
unions and federations, and advocate informal organization, carrying out acts
of resistance in various struggles. Proponents include Wolfi Landstreicher and
Alfredo M. Bonanno, author of works including "Armed Joy" and "The Anarchist
Tension". This tendency is represented in the US in magazines such as "Willful
Disobedience" and Killing King Abacus. Communism. While communism is proposed
as a form of social and economic organisation by many anarchists, other
anarchists consider it a danger to the liberty and free development of the
individual. Most schools of anarchism have recognized a distinction between
libertarian and authoritarian forms of communism. Proudhon said of communism,
"whether of the utopian or the Marxist variety, that it destroyed freedom by
taking away from the individual control over his means of production" and
"Communism is exploitation of the strong by the weak." Mikhail Bakunin stated
"I hate Communism because it is the negation of liberty and because for me
humanity is unthinkable without liberty. I am not a Communist, because
Communism concentrates and swallows up in itself for the benefit of the State
all the forces of society, because it inevitably leads to the concentration of
property in the hands of the State." Bakunin was speaking of 'state communism'
(authoritarian Marxism) as verified by the last line which mentions state
property; anarcho-communists explicitly reject state property and authority,
especially centralized authority. Although Peter Kropotkin, one of the leading
proponents of anarchist communism, while also opposing 'state communism',
argued for an economic model of free distribution between all individuals, many
individualist anarchists oppose communism in all its forms, on the grounds that
voluntary communism is not practicable. Individualist such as Benjamin Tucker,
Victor Yarros, and Henry Appleton have denied that anarcho-communism is a
genuine form of anarchism. They rejected its strategies and argued that it is
inherently authoritarian. In the opinion of individualist Henry Appleton,
"Communism, being opposed to natural law, must necessarily call upon unnatural
methods if it would put itself into practice" and employ "pillage, brute force,
and violence." Anarcho-communists reject the criticism, pointing to the
principle of voluntary association that underpins their theory and
differentiates it from state communism. Some individualist anarchists are also
willing to recognize anarchist communism as a legitimate form. Kevin Carson
writes that "free market, libertarian communist, syndicalism, and other kinds
of collectivist anarchists must learn to coexist in peace and mutual respect
today, in our fight against the corporate state, and tomorrow, in the panarchy
that is likely to succeed it."
