Bequest motive A bequest motive seeks to provide an economic justification for
the phenomenon of gratuitous, intergenerational transfers of wealth. In other
words, to explain why people leave money behind when they die. The most common
explanation for this is altruism, in which it is held that the disponer gains
some form of satisfaction from knowing that his/her heirs will enjoy their
inherited wealth. An example might be a parent leaving a child the family home.
Another common explanation is accidental bequest, developed by economists Yaari
(1965) and Davies (1980). Here it is not assumed that the disponer gains any
specific benefit from leaving a bequest, but rather that lifetime is uncertain,
and so she/he holds precautionary savings to insure him/herself against the
risk of living too long. Finally, exchange bequest occurs where disponers
engage in a sort of strategic game in which potential beneficiaries must render
a (non-marketable) service in exchange for the promise of inherited wealth. The
most widely read model of exchange bequest was published by Bernheim, Summers
and Shleifer (1985). Which bequest motive theory most realistically represents
the intentions of estate planners is unclear. Attempts to test the theories
empirically are mired by poor availability of data about wealth holdings.
