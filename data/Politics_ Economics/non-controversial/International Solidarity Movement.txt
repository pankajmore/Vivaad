International Solidarity Movement The International Solidarity Movement (ISM)
is an organization focused on assisting the Palestinian cause in the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict using nonviolent protests. It was founded in 2001 by
Ghassan Andoni, a Palestinian activist; Neta Golan, an Israeli activist;
Huwaida Arraf, a Palestinian-American; and George N. Rishmawi, a Palestinian
activist. Adam Shapiro, an American, joined the movement shortly after its
founding and is also often considered one of the founders. The organization
calls on civilians from around the world to participate in acts of nonviolent
protests against the Israeli military in the West Bank and previously the Gaza
Strip. Funding. According to the ISM's website, "International volunteers who
join the ISM are responsible for paying their own way and covering all their
expenses in Palestine. The ISM does not receive any funding from any state,
government or association. We rely on donations from average people all over
the world that support peace and the Palestinian struggle for freedom." The ISM
regularly sends speakers on fund-raising trips and encourages funding drives.
Philosophy. The organization calls on civilians from around the world to
participate in acts of non-violent protests against the Israeli military in the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip. It has recently been criticised for working
alongside other groups to pressure Palestinian artists to boycott the One Voice
Peace Summit and for helping to undermine the Summit by creating a competing
event. ISM and affiliated groups critical of the Summit say that One Voice
fails to fully support Palestinian rights guaranteed under international law.
ISM's position on violence. The ISM's website describes the organization as a
"Palestinian-led movement committed to resisting the Israeli occupation of
Palestinian land using nonviolent, direct-action methods and principles". It
emphasizes international volunteers are not there to "teach nonviolent
resistance" but to support resistance through nonviolent direct action,
emergency mobilization and documentation. As enshrined in international law and
UN resolutions , we recognize the Palestinian right to resist Israeli violence
and occupation via legitimate armed struggle. However, we believe that
nonviolence can be a powerful weapon in fighting oppression and we are
committed to the principles of nonviolent resistance. The ISM does not support
or condone any acts of terrorism â€“ which is not legitimate armed struggle.
The ISM does not associate, support, or have anything to do with armed or
violent resistance to the occupation. The ISM does not assist or engage in any
kind of armed resistance, no matter what form it may take.This right to resist
occupation applies not only to the Palestinian people, but to all peoples who
are faced with a military occupation. The ISM regards all people as equals with
equal rights under international law. We believe that nonviolent action is a
powerful weapon in fighting oppression and are committed to the principles of
nonviolent resistance. The article that we wrote was actually in response to
another article written by a Palestinian, who said the Palestinians could not
be nonviolent. And so we were addressing within the context of the debate over
whether the Palestinians could use violence or could not use nonviolence or
could use nonviolence. So it was, first of all, within that context... There
already is violence. Weâ€™re not advocating it. Itâ€™s already there. Itâ€™s on
the ground. Weâ€™re working with people and with Palestinians who want to
promote nonviolence, and that was the context of the whole article. ISM member
casualties in Palestine and Israel. ISM casualties by the Israeli Army.
According to ISM volunteer Joe Carr stated that Israeli troops were always
careful not to hurt ISM volunteers. However, a number of controversial
incidents have taken place. Deaths. Rachel Corrie. ISM volunteer Rachel Corrie
was killed as she attempted to block an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) bulldozer
conducting military operations in Rafah in the Gaza Strip on March 16, 2003.
Controversy surrounds her death. An internal IDF investigation concluded that
Corrie's death was an accident but ISM eyewitnesses vehemently dispute this
account, contending that the bulldozer driver deliberately struck Corrie as she
was protesting in plain view. The IDF claims that tapes of the event show
Corrie below the driver's eye level, and also contend that the noise level was
too loud for Ms. Corrie to be heard. The activities of the bulldozer she was
blocking are also subject to disagreement â€” ISM claim it was preparing to
demolish the home of a Palestinian pharmacist. Other accounts backed by the
film footage claim that the bulldozer was not near a house but was removing
shrubbery covering an arms smuggling tunnel â€” according to an article in
"Mother Jones" magazine, hotly disputed by the ISM, Israeli authorities claimed
that the crew's assignment was to sweep the area for booby traps planted by
militants. The IDF itself has never explicitly claimed that the house contained
a tunnel and two tunnels were found when the home was eventually demolished 9
months later. George Rishmawi of the ISM told the "San Francisco Chronicle"
that: "When Palestinians get shot by Israeli soldiers, no one is interested
anymore. But if some of these foreign volunteers get shot or even killed, then
the international media will sit up and take notice." Corrie's parents brought
lawsuits in the United States and in Israel, but in both cases, they lost the
suit. In Israel, in August 2012, the court said that Corrie could have avoided
danger. The court ruled that Israel was not at fault for Corrieâ€™s death, and
there was neither intent nor negligence involved in her death. The judge also
said that Israel's investigation was appropriate and did not contain mistakes.
The judge also criticized the U.S. for failing to send a diplomatic
representative to observe Corrie's autopsy. Tom Hurndall. On April 11, 2003
Israel Defense Forces soldier Taysir Hayb shot ISM volunteer Tom Hurndall in
the head. Hurndall, who had been aiding Palestinians in Gaza, died of his wound
in January 2004. Hurndall was unarmed, dressed in the bright orange jacket of
the International Solidarity Movement, and steering two Palestinian children
away from an Israeli tank-mounted machine gun shooting in their direction. IDF
Sergeant Taysir Hayb claimed he had shot at a man in military fatigues who was
firing at the soldiers with a pistol, in the no-go security zone. This was at
odds with the ISM's account, confirmed by photographic evidence. Subsequently
Hayb admitted fabricating his account of events. On 10 May 2004, Taysir Hayb's
trial commenced on one charge of manslaughter in the death of Tom Hurndall, two
counts of obstruction of justice, one count each of submitting false testimony,
obtaining false testimony, and unbecoming behaviour. Hurndall's family pressed
for a murder charge through the Israeli courts. In August 2005, Sgt. Hayb was
convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to a total of eight years imprisonment,
seven years for the manslaughter of Hurndall and one year for obstruction of
justice. Injuries. Kate Edwards. Australian ISM volunteer Kate Edwards
sustained internal injuries from a bullet in Beit Jala. She and other
volunteers marched on Israeli lines. After the event, Kate Edwards was quoted
as stating "We were walking up the hill from Bethlehem when a tank came down
the hill towards us. I could see a man in the tank and he was shouting at us to
go back. We carried on going." Caoimhe Butterly. Irish ISM volunteer and human
rights activist Caoimhe Butterly was shot in the thigh by an Israeli soldier
during the Battle of Jenin. Brian Avery. On April 5, 2003 Israeli Defense Force
soldiers on a military convoy shot Brian Avery (born 1979) in the face,
seriously disfiguring him, while he was volunteering for the ISM in the West
Bank city of Jenin. He was wearing red reflector vests with the word "doctor"
in English and Arabic. The IDF refused to order an investigation, saying there
was no proof its soldiers had shot at anyone that day. Avery sued and in
November 2008 accepted a $150,000 settlement from the Israeli government in
exchange for dropping the lawsuit. Tristan Anderson. [http://

of American Citizen, Democracy Now, March 16, 2009. Bianca Zammit. On April 24,
2010 Bianca Zammit, a 28 year old activist from Malta, was shot in the thigh
with live ammunition by IDF soldiers during a demonstration in the so-called
"buffer zone" inside Gaza Strip. Two Palestinian demonstrators were also shot
during the same demonstration in Al Maghazi Refugee Camp. April, 2012. On April
14, while group of at least 200 and several buses pro-Palestinian activists
were riding bicycles in a silent protest (while the legality of the action is
still unclear as some news agencies state the cyclists got a permition to
protest but other state no permit was given), they were stopped by Israeli
soldiers before entering into highway 90, and asked not to continue "for their
own safety". During the ensuing hour, the activists refused and blocked an
entrance to a highway, a "scuffle" broke out: In an interview given by one of
the members he stated "×‘×©×œ×‘ ××¡×•×™×™× ×”×—×œ×˜× ×• ×œ××ª×’×¨ ××ª
×”×—×™×™×œ×™× ×•×œ× ×¡×•×ª ×œ×”××©×™×š ×‘× ×¡×™×¢×”" (at some point we
decided to test the soldiers and continue to move) and after few moments they
had been assaulted and in an interview for JPost "After about half-an-hour, he
said, the cyclists decided to push past the IDF, and that is when the violence
began.". Four activists sustained face and back injuries and had to be
evacuated to a hospital in Jericho, West Bank. The next day, ISM posted a video
showing an IDF officer hitting a Danish protester in the face with his assault
rifle. The IDF officer said that he was attacked by one of the activists in the
incident with a stick, breaking two fingers. The IDF said it was a "grave
incident" and was suspending the officer and investigating the incident. Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, President Shimon Peres, and IDF Chief of General
Staff Lt.-Gen. Benny Gantz all condemned the incident. NGO Monitor said that
ISM "has a long record of encouraging activists to take â€˜direct actionâ€™
that often places them in danger and in direct confrontations with the IDF."
ISM casualties by Palestinian militants. Deaths. Akram Ibrahim Abu Sbaâ€™. On
September 6, 2007, ISM Jenin regional committee member and "co-founder of one
of ISMâ€™s first permanent presences" Akram Ibrahim Abu Sbaâ€™ was killed on
duty by Islamic Jihad militants, while trying to "smooth tensions between
Palestinian security forces and Islamic Jihad members", in the Palestinian city
of Jenin. Akram was buried in the Jenin refugee camp graveyard. Vittorio
Arrigoni. On April 14, 2011, Italian ISM activist Vittorio Arrigoni was
abducted and executed by hanging by a Salafist group in the Gaza Strip.
Criticism and controversies. Position of Israeli Foreign Ministry. The Israeli
Foreign Ministry reported that two terrorists involved in the Mike's Place
suicide bombing forged "links with foreign left wing activists and members of
the International Solidarity Movement (ISM)." The MFA also says that "ISM
members take an active part in illegal and violent actions against IDF
soldiers. At times, their activity in Judea, Samaria and the Gaza Strip is
under the auspices of Palestinian terrorist organizations, and that sometimes,
"ISM members, who seek entry into Israel, often do so under false pretenses,
via cover stories - entry for matrimonial, tourist, religious and other
purposes - which they coordinate prior to arriving in Israel." However, ISM
reports that visitors at the border who identify as ISM volunteers, almost
always will be denied entry by the Israeli border control. Member's work with
Hamas and Islamic Jihad. The Israeli government asserted ISM activist Susan
Barclay had "ties with Palestinian terrorist groups". She stated she worked
with representatives of Hamas and Islamic Jihad in organising a nonviolent
protest. Shadi Sukiya case. On March 27, 2003, Palestinian Shadi Sukiya was
arrested in by the Israel Defense Forces in ISM Jenin. The Israeli government
claimed that Sukiya was a senior Islamic Jihad member, and that he was aided by
two ISM activists. Both parties stated that Sukiya arrived at the ISM's office
as he was being pursued through the streets of Jenin by IDF soldiers during an
Israeli-imposed curfew. According to the ISM's account, he had been going door
to door looking for a place to go, arrived at the building (which is also used
by the Red Cross and Medecins Sans Frontieres) cold and wet, and was offered a
chance to dry and warm up by an ISM volunteer. The IDF originally suggested
that two Kalashnikov assault rifles and a handgun were found on the premises,
but subsequently backtracked on the allegation. In May 2003, Adam Shapiro from
ISM stated that Sukiya was not named a "senior Islamic Jihad terrorist" by any
official Israeli military or government source, and was being held in
administrative detention in Israel without any charge.
