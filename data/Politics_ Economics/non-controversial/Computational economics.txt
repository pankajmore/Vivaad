Computational economics Computational economics is a research discipline at the
interface between computer science and economic and management science. Areas
and subjects encompassed include computational modeling of economic systems,
whether agent-based, general-equilibrium,Â  â€¢ "computation of general
equilibria" by Herbert E. Scarf. Abstract.Â  â€¢ "computation of general
equilibria (new developments)" by Felix Kubler. Abstract. macroeconomic, or
rational-expectations, computational econometrics and statistics,Â Â  â€¢

"statistical decision theory," "The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics", 2nd
Edition. Abstract. computational finance, computational tools for the design of
automated internet markets, programming tools specifically designed for
computational economics, and pedagogical tools for the teaching of
computational economics. Some of these areas are unique to computational
economics, while others extend traditional areas of economics by solving
problems that are difficult to study without the use of computers and
associated numerical methods.Â Â  â€¢ Kenneth L. Judd, 1998. "Numerical Methods
in Economics", MIT Press. Links to description and chapter previews.
Computational economics uses computer-based economic modeling for solution of
analytically and statistically formulated economic problems. A research program
to that end is agent-based computational economics (ACE), the computational
study of economic processes, including whole economies, as dynamic systems of
interacting agents.Â Â  â€¢ Leigh Tesfatsion, 2006. "Agent-Based Computational

objects modeled as interacting according to rules," not real people. Agents can
represent social, biological, and/or physical entities. The theoretical
assumption of mathematical optimization by agents in equilibrium is replaced by
the less restrictive postulate of agents with bounded rationality "adapting" to
market forces,Â Â  â€¢ John H. Holland and John H. Miller (1991). "Artificial

determined by the modeler, an ACE model develops forward through time driven
solely by agent interactions. The ultimate scientific objective of the method
is "to ... test theoretical ï¬ndings against real-world data in ways that
permit empirically supported theories to cumulate over time, with each
researcherâ€™s work building appropriately on the work that has gone before."
Computational solution tools include for example software for carrying out
various matrix operations (e.g. matrix inversion) and for solving systems of
linear and nonlinear equations. For a repository of public-domain computational
solution tools, visit here. The following journals specialize in computational
economics: "Computational Economics", "Journal of Applied Econometrics",
"Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control",Â For a much-cited overview and
