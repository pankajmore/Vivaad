Concentration ratio In economics, a concentration ratio is a measure of the
total output produced in an industry by a given number of firms in the
industry. The most common concentration ratios are the CR4 and the CR8, which
means the market share of the four and the eight largest firms. Concentration
ratios are usually used to show the extent of market control of the largest
firms in the industry and to illustrate the degree to which an industry is
oligopolistic. The standard tools of competition economists and competition
authorities to measure market concentration are the Herfindahl index (HHI) and
the concentration ratios (CR(n)). These two are known as the traditional
structural measures of market concentration (based on market shares). The
concentration of firms in an industry is of interest to economists, business
strategists and government agencies. Two common ratios. Usually, these two
common ratios are comparable from industry to industry, while concentration
ratios for other numbers of firms can be also calculated. Calculation. The
concentration ratio is the percentage of market share held by the largest firms
(m) in an industry. CRm= Î£mi=1 si CRm = s1 + s2 + ... + sm where si is the
market share and m defines the ith firm Concentration levels. Concentration
ratios range from 0 to 100 percent. The levels reach from "no, low" or "medium"
to "high" to "total" concentration. Problems. The definition of the
concentration ratio does not use the market shares of all the firms in the
industry and does not provide the distribution of firm size. It also does not
provide a lot of detail about competitiveness of the industry. The
concentration ratios just provide a sign of the oligopolistic nature of an
industry and indicate the degree of competition. The Herfindahl index provides
a more complete picture of industry concentration than does the concentration
ratio. Electricity specific measures. As to account for the specificities of
electricity markets the specific structural measures are calculated. The
Herfindahl index and the concentration ratios focus on the market shares of
companies, but these measures identify the â€œpivotalnessâ€ of companies to
meeting the demand on the system. A company that is very pivotal can be said to
have a high market power. Pivotal Supplier Index (PSI). The Pivotal Supplier
Index considers in addition to the supply side the demand. At the most basic
level, the PSI answers the question if a particular supplier, the "pivotal
supplier", is needed to supply the demand: would it be possible to supply the
electricity demand also without this supplier or is he mandatory? PSI = I>
Î£ni=I Ci - Total Consumption where Cx is the capacity of the potential pivotal
supplier and the sum of Ci the capacity of all suppliers. The function I[.] is
the indicator function, which takes the value 1 if the expression "." contained
in it is true. PSI = Iconsumption > Î£iâ‰ xCi where the sum of capacities is
taken over all suppliers apart from x. The PSI is a binary indicator that can
be calculated hourly. If the supplier Cx is needed to supply the demand, it is
pivotal and the index takes the value "1". If he is not pivotal, it takes the
value "0". Residual Supply Index (RSI). The Residual Supply Index is a simple
and effective tool in monitoring market power. It is the non-binary alternative
to the PSI. RSI = (Î£n1 Ci - Cx)/Last where Cx is the capacity of the analysed
supplier and the sum of Ci the capacity of all suppliers. Receiving a result
bigger than 100% is an indication that the supplier x should have little
influence on the price. With a RSI smaller than 100%. the supplier x could
easily practise market power. The RSI has the advantage over the PSI to be not
binary and for this reason he can better indicate the increase of the
structural market power. References. German English
