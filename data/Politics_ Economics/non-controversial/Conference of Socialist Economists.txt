Conference of Socialist Economists The Conference of Socialist Economists (CSE)
describes itself as an international, democratic membership organisation
committed to developing a materialist critique of capitalism, unconstrained by
conventional academic divisions between subjects. History. CSE's origins lie in
the general upsurge in socialist politics in the United Kingdom in the 1960s
spurred by disillusion with the Labour government of Harold Wilson, and more
specifically in a corresponding dissatisfaction with orthodox economic theory.
A first conference in January 1970 was attended by 75 people, mainly
economists, who discussed papers on the capital controversy, the state of
development economics, and the internationalisation of capital. A second
conference in October of the same year attracted 125 participants (including 20
from abroad) and considered the economic role of the state in modern
capitalism. This event proved to be the founding conference, deciding to set up
CSE as a permanent organisation, to organise a further conference on Britain
and the EEC, and to investigate launching a journal. This further conference
(December 1971) saw the launch of the "Bulletin of the CSE", with the first
issue containing four of the conference papers. The "Bulletin" was succeeded in
1977 by a refereed journal, "Capital & Class", which continues to be published.
Notwithstanding its name and history, both CSE and "Capital & Class" live up to
the declared aim of being unconstrained by conventional academic subject
divisions. Probably only a minority of CSE members are professional economists,
and the journal's contents range over the whole of the social and human
sciences.
