Fran√ßois-No√´l Babeuf Fran√ßois-No√´l Babeuf (23 November 1760¬ ‚Äì 27 May
1797), known as Gracchus Babeuf (in tribute to the Roman tribunes of the people
and reformers, the Gracchi brothers, and used alongside his self-designation as
"Tribune"), was a French political agitator and journalist of the Revolutionary
period. In spite of the efforts of his Jacobin friends to save him, Babeuf was
arrested, tried, and convicted for his role in the Conspiracy of the Equals.
Although the words ""anarchist""and ""communist"" did not exist in Babeuf's
lifetime, they have all been used to describe his ideas, by later scholars. The
word ""communism"" was coined by Goodwyn Barmby in a conversation with those he
described as the "disciples of Babeuf". Early life. Babeuf was born at St.
Nicaise near the town of Saint-Quentin. His father, Claude Babeuf, had deserted
the French Army in 1738 for that of Maria Theresa of Austria, rising, it is
said, to the rank of major. Amnestied in 1755, he returned to France, but soon
sank into poverty, and had to work as a casual labourer to earn a pittance for
his wife and family. The hardships endured by Babeuf during his early years
contributed to the development of his political opinions. His father gave him a
basic education, but until the outbreak of the Revolution, he was a domestic
servant, and from 1785 occupied the office of "commissaire √  terrier",
assisting the nobles and priests in the assertion of their feudal rights over
the peasants. Accused of abandoning the feudal aristocracy, he would later say
that "the sun of the French Revolution" had brought him to view his "mother,
the feudal system" as a "hydra with a hundred heads." Revolutionary activities.
Babeuf was working for a land surveyor at Roye when the Revolution began. His
father had died in 1780, and he now had to provide for his wife and two
children, as well as for his mother, brothers and sisters. He was a prolific
writer, and the signs of his future socialism are contained in a letter of 21
March 1787, one of a series - mainly on literature - addressed to the secretary
of the Academy of Arras. In 1789 he drew up the first article of the "cahier"
of the electors of the "bailliage" of Roye, demanding the abolition of feudal
rights. From July to October 1789, he lived in Paris, superintending the
publication of his first work: "Cadastre perpetuel, dedi√© a l'assembl√©e
nationale, l'an 1789 et le premier de la libert√© fran√ßaise" ("National
Cadastre, Dedicated to the National Assembly, Year 1789 and the First One of
French Liberty"), which was written in 1789 and issued in 1790. The same year
he published a pamphlet against feudal aids and the "gabelle", for which he was
denounced and arrested, but provisionally released. Propaganda work. In
October, on his return to Roye, he subsequently founded the "Correspondant
Picard", a political journal of which 40 numbers would appear. Babeuf used his
journal to agitate in favor of a progressive taxation system, and he condemned
the "census suffrage" planned for the 1791 elections to the Legislative
Assembly in which the votes of citizens would be weighted according to their
social standing. His political activities led to his arrest on 19 May 1790, but
he was released in July before the F√™te de la F√©d√©ration, thanks to pressure
exerted nationally by the revolutionary and journalist Jean-Paul Marat. In
November he was elected a member of the municipality of Roye, but was expelled.
In March 1791, Babeuf was appointed commissioner to report on the national
property ("biens nationaux") in the town, and in September 1792 was elected a
member of the council-general of the "d√©partement" of the Somme. A rivalry
with the principle administrator and later deputy to the Convention, Andr√©
Dumont, forced Babeuf to transfer to the post of administrator of the district
of Montdidier. There he was accused of fraud for having altered a name in a
deed of transfer of national lands. The error was probably due to negligence;
but, distrusting the impartiality of the judges of the Somme, he fled to Paris,
and on the 23 August 1793 was sentenced "in contumaciam" to twenty years'
imprisonment. Meanwhile he had been appointed secretary to the relief committee
("comit√© des subsistances") of the Paris Commune. The judges of Amiens pursued
him with a warrant for his arrest, which took place in Brumaire of the year II
(1794). The Court of Cassation quashed the sentence, through defect of form,
and sent Babeuf for a new trial before the Aisne tribunal, which acquitted him
on 18 July 1794, only days before the Thermidorian Reaction. Babeuf returned to
Paris, and on 3 September 1794 published the first number of his "Journal de la
Libert√© de la Presse", the title of which was altered on 5 October 1794 to "Le
Tribun du Peuple". The execution of Maximilien Robespierre on 28 July 1794 had
ended the Reign of Terror and begun the White Terror, and Babeuf - now self-
styled "Gracchus" Babeuf - defended the fallen Terror politicians with the
stated goal of achieving equality "in fact" and not only "by proclamation,"
though of the Terror he declared, "I object to this particular aspect of their
system." Babeuf attacked the leaders of the Thermidorian Reaction and, from a
socialist point of view, the economic outcome of the Revolution. He also argued
for the inclusion of women into the political clubs. This was an attitude which
had few supporters, even in the Jacobin Club, and in October Babeuf was
arrested and imprisoned at Arras. Here he was influenced by political
prisoners, notably Philippe Buonarroti, Simon Duplay, and Lebois, editor of the
"Journal de l'√âgalit√©" and afterwards of the "L'Ami du peuple" papers of
Leclerc which carried on the traditions of Jean-Paul Marat. Babeuf emerged from
prison a confirmed advocate of revolution and convinced that his project, fully
proclaimed to the world in Issue 33 of his "Tribun", could only come about
through the restoration of the Constitution of 1793. That constitution had been
ratified by a national referendum by universal male suffrage but never
implemented. In February 1795 he was again arrested, and the "Tribun du peuple"
was solemnly burnt in the "Th√©atre des Bergeres" by the "jeunesse dor√©e",
young men whose mission it was to root out Jacobinism. But for the appalling
economic conditions produced by the fall in the value of "assignats", Babeuf
might have shared the fate of other agitators who were whipped into obscurity.
"Societ√© des √©gaux". It was the attempts of the Directory to deal with the
economic crisis that gave Babeuf his historical importance. The new government
was pledged to abolish the system by which Paris was fed at the expense of all
France, and the cessation of the distribution of bread and meat at nominal
prices was fixed for 20 February 1796. The announcement caused the most
widespread consternation. Not only the workmen and the large class of
proletarians attracted to Paris by the system, but "rentiers" and government
officials, whose incomes were paid in "assignats" on a scale arbitrarily fixed
by the government, saw themselves threatened with starvation. The government
yielded to the outcry; but the expedients by which it sought to mitigate the
evil, notably the division of those entitled to relief into classes, only
increased the alarm and discontent. The universal misery gave point to virulent
attacks by Babeuf on the existing order, and gained him a hearing. He gathered
around him a small circle of followers known as the "Societ√© des √©gaux", soon
merged with the rump of the Jacobin Club, who met at the Panth√©on; and in
November 1795 he was reported by the police to be openly preaching
""insurrection, revolt and the constitution of 1793"". They were influenced by
Sylvain Mar√©chal, the author of "Le Manifeste des Egaux" and a sympathiser of
Babeuf. For a time the government, while keeping itself informed of his
activities, left him alone. It suited the Directory to let the socialist
agitation continue, in order to deter the people from joining in any royalist
movement for the overthrow of the existing r√©gime. Moreover the mass of the
"ouvriers", even of extreme views, were repelled by Babeuf's bloodthirstiness;
and the police agents reported that his agitation was making many converts -
for the government. The Jacobin Club refused to admit Babeuf and Lebois, on the
ground that they were ""√©gorgeurs"" ("throat-cutters"). With the development
of the economic crisis, however, Babeuf's influence increased. After the club
of the Panth√©on was closed by Napoleon Bonaparte on 27 February 1796, his
aggressive activity redoubled. In Vent√¥se and Germinal (roughly late winter
and early spring) he published, under the "nom de plume" of "Lalande, soldat de
la patrie", a new paper, the "Eclaireur du Peuple, ou le D√©fenseur de Vingt-
Cinq Millions d'Opprim√©s", which was hawked clandestinely from group to group
in the streets of Paris. At the same time Issue 40 of the "Tribun" excited an
immense sensation. In this Babeuf praised the authors of the September
Massacres as ""deserving well of their country"", and declared that a more
complete ""2 September"" was needed to annihilate the actual government, which
consisted of ""starvers, bloodsuckers, tyrants, hangmen, rogues and
mountebanks"". The distress among all classes continued; and in March the
attempt of the Directory to replace the "assignats" by a new issue of "mandats"
created fresh dissatisfaction after the breakdown of the hopes first raised. A
cry went up that national bankruptcy had been declared, and thousands of the
lower class of "ouvriers" began to rally to Babeuf's flag. On 4 April 1796, the
government received a report that 500,000 people in Paris were in need of
relief. From 11 April, Paris was placarded with posters headed "Analyse de la
Doctrine de Baboeuf" ", Tribun du Peuple", of which the opening sentence ran:
""Nature has given to every man the right to the enjoyment of an equal share in
all property"", and which ended with a call to restore the Constitution of
1793. Arrest and execution. Babeuf's song "Mourant de faim, mourant de froid"
("Dying of Hunger, Dying of Cold"), set to a popular tune, began to be sung in
the "caf√©s", with immense applause; and reports circulated that the
disaffected troops of the French Revolutionary Army in the camp of Grenelle
were ready to join an insurrection against the government. The Directory
thought it time to react; the "bureau central" had accumulated through its
agents, notably the ex-captain Georges Grisel, who had been initiated into
Babeuf‚Äôs society, complete evidence of a conspiracy (later known as the
""Conspiracy of Equals"") for an armed rising fixed for Flor√©al 22, year IV
(11 May 1796), in which Jacobins and socialists were combined. On 10 May
Babeuf, who had taken the alias "Tissot", was arrested; many of his associates
were gathered by the police on order from Lazare Carnot: among them were
Augustin Alexandre Darth√© and Philippe Buonarroti, the ex-members of the
National Convention, Robert Lindet, Jean-Pierre-Andr√© Amar, Marc-Guillaume
Alexis Vadier and Jean-Baptiste Drouet, famous as the postmaster of Saint-
Menehould who had arrested Louis XVI during the latter's "Flight to Varennes",
and now a member of the Directory's Council of Five Hundred. The government
crackdown was extremely successful. The last number of the "Tribun" appeared on
24 April, although Lebois in the "Ami du peuple" tried to incite the soldiers
to revolt, and for a while there were rumours of a military rising. The trial
of Babeuf and his accomplices was fixed to take place before the newly
constituted high court of justice at Vend√¥me. On Fructidor 10 and 11 (27
August and 28 August 1796), when the prisoners were removed from Paris, there
were tentative efforts at a riot with a view to rescue, but these were easily
suppressed. The attempt of five or six hundred Jacobins (7 September 1796) to
rouse the soldiers at Grenelle met with no better success. The trial of Babeuf
and the others, begun at Vend√¥me on 20 February 1797, lasted two months. The
government for reasons of their own depicted the socialist Babeuf as the leader
of the conspiracy, though more important people than he were implicated; and
his own vanity played admirably into their hands. On Prairial 7 (26 May 1797)
Babeuf and Darth√© were condemned to death; some of the prisoners, including
Buonarroti, were deported; the rest, including Vadier and his fellow-
conventionals, were acquitted. Drouet had succeeded in making his escape,
according to Paul Barras, with the connivance of the Directory. Babeuf and
Darth√© were guillotined the next day at Vend√¥me, Prairial 8 (27 May 1797),
without appeal. Quotes. ‚Äî ‚ÄúSociety must be made to operate in such a way
