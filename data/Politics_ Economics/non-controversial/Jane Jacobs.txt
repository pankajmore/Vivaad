Jane Jacobs Jane Jacobs, (May 4, 1916 â€“ April 25, 2006) was an American-
Canadian writer and activist with primary interest in communities and urban
planning and decay. She is best known for "The Death and Life of Great American
Cities" (1961), a powerful critique of the urban renewal policies of the 1950s
in the United States. The book has been described as "one of 20th-century
architecture's most traumatic events", but also credited with reaching beyond
planning issues to influence the spirit of the times. Within months of the
completion of her book (1961) which promoted a grassroots, organic,
neighbourhood-based process to rehabilitate buildings, Jacobs learned that her
555 Hudson Street Greenwich Village home, was in an area targeted by Robert
Moses for a $7 million urban renewal which would mean evictions and clearance
of old buildings replaced by a carefully-planned middle-income housing project.
The influential Harvard Economist Edward Glaeser, known for his work on urban
studies, acknowledged (2007-01-19) that Jane Jacobs (1960s) had been prescient
in attacking Moses for "replacing well-functioning neighborhoods with Le
Corbusier-inspired towers." Glaeser agreed that these housing projects proved
to be Moses' greatest failures, "Moses spent millions and evicted tens of
thousands to create buildings that became centers of crime, poverty, and
despair (Glaeser 2007-01-19)." Along with her well-known printed works, Jacobs
is equally well known for organizing grassroots efforts to block urban-renewal
projects that would have destroyed local neighborhoods. She was instrumental in
the eventual cancellation of the Lower Manhattan Expressway, and after moving
to Canada in 1968, equally influential in cancelling the Spadina Expressway and
the associated network of expressways in Toronto planned and under
construction. American years. Jane Butzner was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania,
the daughter of a doctor and a former teacher and nurse, who were Protestant in
a heavily Roman Catholic town. After graduating from Scranton's Central High
School, she took an unpaid position as the assistant to the women's page editor
at the "Scranton Tribune". A year later, in the middle of the Great Depression,
she left Scranton for New York City. During her first several years in the
city, Jacobs held a variety of jobs, working mainly as a stenographer and
freelance writer, often writing about working districts in the city. These
experiences, she later said, "â€¦ gave me more of a notion of what was going on
in the city and what business was like, what work was like." Her first job was
for a trade magazine, first as a secretary, then as an editor. She also sold
articles to the "Sunday Herald Tribune". She then became a feature writer for
the Office of War Information. While working there she met an architect named
Robert Hyde Jacobs whom she married in 1944. Together they had two sons, James
and Ned, and a daughter, Burgin. She studied at Columbia University's School of
General Studies for two years, taking courses in geology, zoology, law,
political science, and economics. About the freedom to study her wide-ranging
interests, she said: On March 25, 1952, Jacobs responded to Conrad E. Snow,
chairman of the Loyalty Security Board at the United States Department of
State. In her foreword to her answer she said: Opposing expressways and
supporting neighborhoods were common themes in her life. In 1962, she was the
chairperson of the "Joint Committee to Stop the Lower Manhattan Expressway",
when the downtown expressway plan was killed. She was again involved in
stopping the Lower Manhattan Expressway and was arrested during a demonstration
on April 10, 1968. Jacobs opposed Robert Moses, who had already forced through
the Cross-Bronx Expressway and other roadways against neighborhood opposition.
A late 1990s Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) documentary series on New
Yorkâ€™s history devoted a full hour of its fourteen hours to the battle
between Moses and Jacobs, although Robert Caro's highly critical biography of
Moses, "The Power Broker", gives only passing mention to this event, despite
Jacobs's strong influence on Caro. Canadian life. In 1968, Jacobs moved to
Toronto, where she lived until her death. She decided to leave the United
States in part because of her objection to the Vietnam War and worry about the
fate of her two draft-age sons. She and her husband chose Toronto because it
was pleasant and offered employment opportunities. She quickly became a leading
figure in her new city and helped stop the proposed Spadina Expressway. A
frequent theme of her work was to ask whether we are building cities for people
or for cars. She was arrested twice during demonstrations. She also had
considerable influence on the regeneration of the St. Lawrence neighborhood, a
housing project regarded as a major success. She became a Canadian citizen in
1974, and she later told writer James Howard Kunstler that dual citizenship was
not possible at the time, implying that her US citizenship was lost. In 1980,
she offered an urbanistic perspective on Quebec's sovereignty in her book "The
Question of Separatism: Quebec and the Struggle over Separation". Jacobs was an
advocate of a Province of Toronto to separate the city proper from Ontario.
Jacobs said, "Cities, to thrive in the 21st century, must separate themselves
politically from their surrounding areas." She was selected to be an officer of
the Order of Canada in 1996 for her seminal writings and thought-provoking
commentaries on urban development. The Community and Urban Sociology section of
the American Sociological Association awarded her its Outstanding Lifetime
Contribution award in 2002. In 1997, the City of Toronto sponsored a conference
titled "Jane Jacobs: Ideas That Matter", which led to a book by the same name.
At the end of the conference, the "Jane Jacobs Prize" was created. It includes
an annual stipend of $5,000 for three years to be given to "celebrate Toronto's
original, unsung heroes â€” by seeking out citizens who are engaged in
activities that contribute to the cityâ€™s vitality". Jacobs never shied away
from expressing her political support for specific candidates. She opposed the
1997 amalgamation of the cities of Metro Toronto, fearing that individual
neighborhoods would have less power with the new structure. She backed an
ecologist, Tooker Gomberg, who lost Toronto's 2000 mayoralty race, and was an
adviser to David Miller's successful mayoral campaign in 2003, at a time when
he was seen as a . During the mayoral campaign, Jacobs helped lobby against the
construction of a bridge to join the city's waterfront to Toronto City Center
Airport (TCCA). Following the election, Toronto City Councilâ€™s earlier
decision to approve the bridge was reversed and bridge construction project was
stopped. TCCA did upgrade the ferry service and the airport is still in
operation as of 2011. Jacobs was also active in a fight against a plan of Royal
St. George's College (an established school very close to Jacobs' long-time
residence in Torontoâ€™s Annex district) to reconfigure its facilities. Jacobs
suggested not only that the redesign be stopped but also the school be forced
from the neighborhood entirely. Although Toronto council initially rejected the
schoolâ€™s plans, the decision was later reversed â€” and the project was given
the go-ahead by the Ontario Municipal Board (OMB) when opponents failed to
produce credible witnesses and tried to withdraw from the case during the
hearing. She had an influence Vancouver's urban planning, also. Jacobs has been
called "the mother of Vancouverism", referring to that city's use of her
"density done well" philosophy. Legacy. She was also famous for her phrase
"Eyes on the Street", a reference to what would later be known as natural
surveillance. It is evident through her interview with Bill Steigerwald in June
2001, that despite the virtuosity, public and intellectual awareness and
influence of Jane Jacobs' first book, "The Death and Life of Great American
Cities", she herself believes that her later works were historically more
important. In spite of this, her work in regards to planning has not been
disregarded. In the world of planning, Jane Jacobs' observations about the ways
in which cities function, revolutionized the urban planning profession and
discredited many accepted planning models that dominated mid-century planning.
Through her life, she fought to alter the way in which city development was
approached. By arguing that cities were living beings and ecosystems, she
advocated ideas such as "mixed use" development and bottom-up planning.
Furthermore, her harsh criticisms of "slum clearing" and "high-rise housing"
projects were instrumental in discrediting these once universally supported
planning practices. Jane Jacobs will be remembered as being an advocate for the
mindful development of cities and has left "a legacy of empowerment for
citizens to trust their common sense and become advocates for their place".
Despite the fact that Jane Jacobs mainly focused on New York, her arguments
have been identified as universal. For instance, her opposition against the
demolition of urban neighbourhoods for projects of urban renewal had "special
resonance" in Melbourne, Australia. In Melbourne in the 1960s, resident
associations fought against large-scale high-rise housing projects of the
Housing Commission of Victoria, which they argued had little regard for the
impact on local communities. Throughout her life, Jane Jacobs fought an uphill
battle against dominant trends of planning. Despite the United States remaining
very much a suburban nation, the work of Jacobs has contributed to city living
being rehabilitated and revitalized. Because of her ideas, today, many
distressed urban neighbourhoods are more likely to be gentrified than cleared
for redevelopment. The City of Toronto proclaimed Friday May 4, 2007, as Jane
Jacobs Day in Toronto. Two dozen free walks around and about Toronto
neighborhoods, dubbed Jane's Walk, were held on Saturday May 5, 2007. A Jane's
Walk event was later held in New York in on September 29 and 30, 2007, and, for
2008, the event has spread to eight cities and towns across Canada. The
Municipal Art Society of New York partnered with the Rockefeller Foundation to
host an exhibit focusing on "Jane Jacobs and the Future of New York" which
opened at the MAS on September 26, 2007. The exhibit aimed to educate the
public on her writings and activism and uses tools to encourage new generations
to become active in issues involving their own neighborhoods. An accompanying
exhibit publication includes essays and articles by such architecture critics,
artists, activists and journalists as Malcolm Gladwell, Reverend Billy, Robert
Neuwirth, Tom Wolfe, Thomas de Monchaux, and William McDonough. Many of these
contributors are participating in a series of panel discussions on "Jane Jacobs
and the Future of New York" taking place at venues across the city in Fall,
2007. Jane Jacobs Medal. The Canadian Urban Institute also offers an award in
Jacobs' name, the JaneÂ JacobsÂ Lifetime AchievementÂ Award. The 2011 winner
was Eberhard Zeidler. Jacobs received the second Vincent Scully Prize from the
National Building Museum in 2000. Criticism. Jacobs was not professionally
trained in urban planning; her ideas were developed through personal experience
and observation. The planners and developers that she fought in order to
preserve West Greenwich Village were among those who initially criticised her
ideas. Robert Moses has generally been identified as her archrival during this
period. Since then, Jacobsâ€™ ideas have been analysed many times, often in
regards to the outcomes that their influences have produced. In places like
West Greenwich Village, the factors that she argued would maintain economic and
cultural diversity have instead led to gentrification and some of the most
expensive real estate in the world. Arguably, her own white-collar familyâ€™s
conversion of an old candy shop into a home was indicative of the gentrifying
trend that would continue under the influence of Jacobâ€™s ideas. However,
gentrification was also caused by "the completely unexpected influx of affluent
residents back into the inner city". The extent to which her ideas facilitated
this phenomenon was at the time unimaginable. For example, she advocated the
preservation of older buildings specifically because their lack of economic
value made them affordable for poor people. In this respect, she saw them as
"guarantors of social diversity" (Klemek, 2011:76). That many of these older
structures have increased in economic value solely due to their age was
implausible in 1961. Issues of gentrification have dominated criticism of Jane
Jacobsâ€™ planning ideas. But her concepts have also been criticised more
broadly. For example, although her ideas of planning were praised at times as
"universal", they were criticized as inapplicable when a city grows from one
million to ten million (as has happened many times in the Third World). Such
arguments suggest that the ideas apply only to cities with similar issues to
that of New York, where Jacobs developed many of her ideas. In respect to Third
World cities, her ideas have been criticized for not addressing problems of
scale, or explaining how infrastructure should be built. Perhaps her support of
bottom-up and small-scale development initiatives would indicate that all urban
areas are different and require individualized initiatives, as opposed to major
projects of urban renewal. Works. "The Death and Life of Great American
Cities". "The Death and Life of Great American Cities" is her single-most
influential book and possibly the most influential American book on urban
planning and cities. Widely read by both planning professionals and the general
public, the book is a strong critique of the urban renewal policies of the
1950s, which, she claimed, destroyed communities and created isolated,
unnatural urban spaces. Jacobs advocated the abolition of zoning laws and
restoration of free markets in land, which would result in dense, mixed-use
neighborhoods and frequently cited New York City's Greenwich Village as an
example of a vibrant urban community. Robert Caro has cited it as the strongest
influence on "The Power Broker," his Pulitzer-winning biography of Robert
Moses, though Caro does not mention Jacobs by name even once in the book
despite Jacobs' battles with Moses over his proposed Lower Manhattan
Expressway. Beyond the practical lessons in city design and planning that
"Death and Life" offers, the theoretical underpinnings of the work challenge
the modern development mindset. Jane Jacobs defends her positions with common
sense and undeniable anecdote. "The Economy of Cities". The thesis of this book
is that cities are the primary drivers of economic development. Her main
argument is that explosive economic growth derives from urban import
replacement. Import replacement occurs when a city begins to locally produce
goods that it formerly imported, e.g., Tokyo bicycle factories replacing Tokyo
bicycle importers in the 1800s. Jacobs claims that import replacement builds up
local infrastructure, skills, and production. Jacobs also claims that the
increased production is subsequently exported to other cities, giving those
other cities a new opportunity to engage in import replacement, thus producing
a positive cycle of growth. In the foremost chapter of the book, Jacobs argues
that cities preceded agriculture. She argues that in cities trade in wild
animals and grains allowed for the initial division of labor necessary for the
discovery of husbandry and agriculture; these discoveries then moved out of the
city due to land competition. "The Question of Separatism: Quebec and the
Struggle over Sovereignty". The Question of Separatism incorporated and
expanded Jacobsâ€™ presentation of the 1979 Massey Lectures, entitled "Canadian
Cities and Sovereignty-Association". Published in 1980 and reprinted in 2011
with a previously unpublished 2005 interview on the subject, Jacobs' book
advances the view that Quebec's eventual independence is best for Montreal,
Toronto, the rest of Canada, and the world; and that such independence can be
achieved peacefully. As precedent, she cites Norwayâ€™s secession from Sweden
and how it enriched both nations. The origins of the contemporary secessionist-
movement in the Quiet Revolution are examined, along with Canadaâ€™s historical
reliance on natural resources and foreign-owned manufacturing for its own
economic development. Jacobs asserts that such an approach is colonial and
hence backward, citing by example Canada buying its skis and furniture from
Norway or Norwegian-owned factories in Canada, the latter procedure being a
product of Canadian tariffs designed specifically to foster such factories. The
relevant public views of RenÃ© LÃ©vesque, Claude Ryan, and then Prime Minister
Pierre Trudeau are also critically analyzed, an example being their failure to
recognize that two respective, independent currencies are essential to the
success of an independent Quebec and a smaller resultant Canada, an issue that
is central to her book. Jacobs stresses the need for Montreal to continue
developing its leadership of QuÃ©bÃ©cois culture, but that such a need can
ultimately never be fulfilled by Montreal's increasing tendencies toward
regional-city status, tendencies foretelling economic, political, and cultural
subservience to English-speaking Toronto. Such an outcome, Jacobs believed,
would in the long run doom Quebec's independence as much as it would hinder
Canada's own future. She concludes with her observation that the popular
equating of political secession with political and economic failure is the
result of the Enlightenment, which perceived nature as a force for
"standardization, uniformity, universality, and immutability." Since then,
naturalists and their readers have gradually realized that nature is a force
for diversity, and that, "diversity itself is of the essence of excellence."
The right kind of secession, Jacobs states, can lead to the right kind of
diversity, and Quebec and Canada are capable of both, and must achieve both, to
survive. "Cities and the Wealth of Nations". "Cities and the Wealth of Nations"
attempts to do for economics what "The Death and Life of Great American Cities"
did for modern urban planning, though it has not received the same critical
attention. Beginning with a concise treatment of classical economics, this book
challenges one of the fundamental assumptions of the greatest economists.
Classical (and Neo-classical) economists consider the nation-state to be the
main player in macroeconomics. Jacobs argues that it is not the nation-state,
rather it is the city which is the true player in this worldwide game. She
restates the idea of import replacement from her earlier book "The Economy of
Cities", while speculating on the further ramifications of considering the city
first and the nation second, or not at all. "Systems of Survival". "Systems of
Survival: A Dialogue on the Moral Foundations of Commerce and Politics" moves
outside of the city, studying the moral underpinnings of work. As with her
other work, she used an observational approach. This book is written as a
Platonic dialogue. It appears that she (as described by characters in her book)
took newspaper clippings of moral judgements related to work, collected and
sorted them to find that they fit two patterns of moral behaviour that were
mutually exclusive. She calls these two patterns "Moral Syndrome A", or
commercial moral syndrome, and "Moral Syndrome B", or guardian moral syndrome.
She claims that the commercial moral syndrome is applicable to business owners,
scientists, farmers, and traders. Similarly, she claims that the guardian moral
syndrome is applicable to government, charities, hunter-gatherers, and
religious institutions. She also claims that these Moral Syndromes are fixed,
and do not fluctuate over time. It is important to stress that Jane Jacobs is
providing a theory about the morality of work, and not all moral ideas. Moral
ideas that are not included in her syndrome are applicable to both syndromes.
Jane Jacobs goes on to describe what happens when these two moral syndromes are
mixed, showing the work underpinnings of the Mafia and communism, and what
happens when New York Subway Police are paid bonuses here â€” reinterpreted
slightly as a part of the larger analysis. "The Nature of Economies". "The
Nature of Economies", a dialog between friends concerning the premise: "human
beings exist wholly within nature as part of the natural order in every
respect" (p "ix"), argues that the same principles underlie both ecosystems and
economies: "development and co-development through differentiations and their
combinations; expansion through diverse, multiple uses of energy; and self-
maintenance through self-refueling" (p82). Jacobs' characters discuss the four
methods by which "dynamically stable systems" may evade collapse:
"bifurcations; positive-feedback loops; negative-feedback controls; and
emergency adaptations" (p86). Their conversations also cover the "double nature
of fitness for survival" (traits to avoid destroying one's own habitat as well
as success in competition to feed and breed, p119), and unpredictability
including the butterfly effect characterized in terms of multiplicity of
variables as well as disproportional response to cause, and self-organization
where "a system can be making itself up as it goes along" (p137). Through the
dialogue, Jacobs' characters explore and examine the similarities between the
functioning of ecosystems and economies. Topics include environmental and
economic development, growth and expansion, and how economies and environments
keep themselves alive through "self-refueling." Jacobs also comments on the
nature of economic and biological diversity and its role in the development and
growth of the two kinds of systems. The book is infused with many real-world
economic and biological examples, which help keep the book "down to earth" and
comprehensible, if dense. Concepts are furnished with both economic and
biological examples, showing their coherence in both worlds. One particularly
interesting insight is the creation of "something from nothing" â€” an economy
from nowhere. In the biological world, free energy is given through sunlight,
but in the economic world human creativity and natural resources supply this
free energy, or at least starter energy. Another interesting insight is the
creation of economic diversity through the combination of different
technologies, for example the typewriter and television as inputs and outputs
of a computer system: this can lead to the creation of "new species of work".
"Dark Age Ahead". Published in 2004 by Random House, in "Dark Age Ahead" Jacobs
argued that "North American" civilization showed signs of spiral of decline
comparable to the collapse of the Roman empire. Her thesis focused on "five
pillars of our culture that we depend on to stand firm," which can be
summarized as the nuclear family (but also community), education, science,
representational government and taxes, and corporate and professional
accountability. As the title suggests, her outlook was far more pessimistic
than in her previous books. However, in the conclusion she wrote that, "At a
given time it is hard to tell whether forces of cultural life or death are in
the ascendancy. Is suburban sprawl, with its murders of communities and wastes
of land, time, and energy, a sign of decay? Or is rising interest in means of
overcoming sprawl a sign of vigor and adaptability in North American culture?
Arguably, either could turn out to be true."
