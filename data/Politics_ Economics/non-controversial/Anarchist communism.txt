Anarchist communism Anarchist communism (also known as anarcho-communism and
occasionally as free communism or libertarian communism) is a theory of
anarchism which advocates the abolition of the state, capitalism and private
property (while retaining respect for personal property), and in favor of
common ownership of the means of production, direct democracy and a horizontal
network of voluntary associations and workers' councils with production and
consumption based on the guiding principle: "from each according to his
ability, to each according to his need". Some forms of anarchist communism such
as insurrectionary anarchism are strongly influenced by egoism and radical
individualism, believing anarcho-communism is the best social system for the
realization of individual freedom. Most anarcho-communists view anarcho-
communism as a way of reconciling the opposition between the individual and
society. Anarcho-communism developed out of radical socialist currents after
the French revolution but was first formulated as such in the Italian section
of the First International. The theoretical work of Peter Kropotkin took
importance later as it expanded and developed pro-organizationalist and
insurrectionary anti-organizationalist sections. To date, the best-known
examples of an anarchist communist society (i.e., established around the ideas
as they exist today and achieving worldwide attention and knowledge in the
historical canon), are the anarchist territories during the Spanish Revolution
and the Free Territory during the Russian Revolution. Through the efforts and
influence of the Spanish Anarchists during the Spanish Revolution within the
Spanish Civil War, starting in 1936 anarchist communism existed in most of
Aragon, parts of the Levante and Andalusia, as well as in the stronghold of
Anarchist Catalonia before being crushed by the combined forces of the regime
that won the war, Hitler, Mussolini, Spanish Communist Party repression (backed
by the USSR) as well as economic and armaments blockades from the capitalist
countries and the Second Spanish Republic itself. During the Russian
Revolution, anarchists such as Nestor Makhno worked to create and
defend‚Äîthrough the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine‚Äîanarchist
communism in the Free Territory of the Ukraine from 1919 before being conquered
by the Bolsheviks in 1921. History. Early developments. Anarchist communist
currents appeared during the English Civil War and the French Revolution of the
17th and 18th centuries, respectively. Gerrard Winstanley, who was part of the
radical Diggers movement in England, wrote in his 1649 pamphlet, "The New Law
of Righteousness", that there "shall be no buying or selling, no fairs nor
markets, but the whole earth shall be a common treasury for every man," and
"there shall be none Lord over others, but every one shall be a Lord of
himself." During the French Revolution, Sylvain Mar√©chal, in his "Manifesto of
the Equals" (1796), demanded "the communal enjoyment of the fruits of the
earth" and looked forward to the disappearance of "the revolting distinction of
rich and poor, of great and small, of masters and valets, of governors and
governed." Joseph D√©jacque and the Revolutions of 1848. An early anarchist
communist was Joseph D√©jacque, the first person to describe himself as
"libertarian". Unlike Proudhon, he argued that, "it is not the product of his
or her labor that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or
her needs, whatever may be their nature." Returning to New York he was able to
serialise his book in his periodical "Le Libertaire, Journal du Mouvement
social". Published in 27 issues from June 9, 1858 to February 4, 1861, "Le
Libertaire" was the first anarcho-communist journal published in America. This
was the first anarchist journal to use the term "libertarian". According to the
anarchist historian Max Nettlau, the first use of the term libertarian
communism was in November 1880, when a French anarchist congress employed it to
more clearly identify its doctrines. The French anarchist journalist S√©bastien
Faure, later founder and editor of the four-volume "Anarchist Encyclopedia,"
started the weekly paper "Le Libertaire" ("The Libertarian") in 1895. Dejacque
"rejected Blanquism, which was based on a division between the ‚Äòdisciples of
the great people‚Äôs Architect‚Äô and ‚Äòthe people, or vulgar herd,‚Äô and was
equally opposed to all the variants of social republicanism, to the
dictatorship of one man and to ‚Äòthe dictatorship of the little prodigies of
the proletariat.‚Äô With regard to the last of these, he wrote that: ‚Äòa
dictatorial committee composed of workers is certainly the most conceited and
incompetent, and hence the most anti-revolutionary, thing that can be found...
(It is better to have doubtful enemies in power than dubious friends)‚Äô. He
saw ‚Äòanarchic initiative,‚Äô ‚Äòreasoned will‚Äô and ‚Äòthe autonomy of
each‚Äô as the conditions for the social revolution of the proletariat, the
first expression of which had been the barricades of June 1848 (see Revolutions
of 1848). In D√©jacque‚Äôs view, a government resulting from an insurrection
remains a reactionary fetter on the free initiative of the proletariat. Or
rather, such free initiative can only arise and develop by the masses ridding
themselves of the ‚Äòauthoritarian prejudices‚Äô by means of which the state
reproduces itself in its primary function of representation and delegation.
D√©jacque wrote that: ‚ÄòBy government I understand all delegation, all power
outside the people,‚Äô for which must be substituted, in a process whereby
politics is transcended, the ‚Äòpeople in direct possession of their
sovereignty,‚Äô or the ‚Äòorganised commune.‚Äô For D√©jacque, the communist
anarchist utopia would fulfil the function of inciting each proletarian to
explore his or her own human potentialities, in addition to correcting the
ignorance of the proletarians concerning ‚Äòsocial science.‚Äô" The
International Workingmen's Association (1864‚Äì1876). The collectivist
anarchists advocated remuneration for the type and amount of labor adhering to
the principle "to each according to deeds"; but held out the possibility of a
post-revolutionary transition to a communist system of distribution according
to need. As Bakunin's associate, James Guillaume, put it in his essay, "Ideas
on Social Organization" (1876), "When... production comes to outstrip
consumption... will draw what he needs from the abundant social reserve of
commodities, without fear of depletion; and the moral sentiment which will be
more highly developed among free and equal workers will prevent, or greatly
reduce, abuse and waste." Anarchist communism as a coherent, modern economic-
political philosophy was first formulated in the Italian section of the First
International by Carlo Cafiero, Emilio Covelli, Errico Malatesta, Andrea Costa
and other ex-Mazzinian Republicans. Out of respect for Mikhail Bakunin, they
did not make their differences with collectivist anarchism explicit until after
Bakunin's death. The collectivist anarchists sought to collectivize ownership
of the means of production while retaining payment proportional to the amount
and kind of labor of each individual, but the anarcho-communists sought to
extend the concept of collective ownership to the products of labor as well.
While both groups argued against capitalism, the anarchist communists departed
from Proudhon and Bakunin, who maintained that individuals have a right to the
product of their individual labor and to be remunerated for their particular
contribution to production. But, Errico Malatesta put it: "...instead of
running the risk of making a confusion in trying to distinguish what you and I
each do, let us all work and put everything in common. In this way each will
give to society all that his strength permits until enough is produced for
every one; and each will take all that he needs, limiting his needs only in
those things of which there is not yet plenty for every one." "The Italian
Federation considers the collective property of the products of labour as the
necessary complement to the collectivist programme, the aid of all for the
satisfaction of the needs of each being the only rule of production and
consumption which corresponds to the principle of solidarity. The federal
congress at Florence has eloquently demonstrated the opinion of the Italian
International on this point..." The above report was made in an article by
Malatesta and Cafiero in the (Swiss) Jura Federation's bulletin later that
year. Peter Kropotkin. Peter Kropotkin (1842-1921), often seen as the most
important theorist of anarchist communism, outlined his economic ideas in "The
Conquest of Bread" and "Fields, Factories and Workshops". Kropotkin felt that
cooperation is more beneficial than competition, arguing in his major
scientific work "" that this was well-illustrated in nature. He advocated the
abolition of private property (while retaining respect for personal property)
through the "expropriation of the whole of social wealth" by the people
themselves, and for the economy to be co-ordinated through a horizontal network
of voluntary associations where goods are distributed according to the physical
needs of the individual, rather than according to labor. He further argued that
these "needs," as society progressed, would not merely be physical needs but
"soon as his material wants are satisfied, other needs, of an artistic
character, will thrust themselves forward the more ardently. Aims of life vary
with each and every individual; and the more society is civilized, the more
will individuality be developed, and the more will desires be varied."
Individuals and groups would use and control whatever resources they needed, as
the aim of anarchist communism was to place "the product reaped or manufactured
at the disposal of all, leaving to each the liberty to consume them as he
pleases in his own home." He supported the expropriation of private property
into the commons or public goods (while retaining respect for personal
property), to ensure that everyone would have access to what they needed
without being forced to sell their labour to get it. He said that a "peasant
who is in possession of just the amount of land he can cultivate," and "a
family inhabiting a house which affords them just enough space... considered
necessary for that number of people" and the artisan "working with their own
tools or handloom" would not be interfered with, arguing that "he landlord owes
his riches to the poverty of the peasants, and the wealth of the capitalist
comes from the same source." While many anarcho-communists are opposed to
trade, some post-left and post-scarcity anarcho-communists, and ones with
syndicalist sympathies, are not opposed to trade. Some support a non-monetary
form of trade in the form of non-monetary commons. Others such as Tiziana
Terranova easily see anarcho-communism being compatible with a non-
hierarchical, open access, free association, non-monetary form of trade such as
P2P. Organizationalism vs. insurrectionarism. "In 1876, at the Berne conference
of the International Working Men's Association, the Italian anarchist Errico
Malatesta argued that the revolution "consists more of deeds than words", and
that action was the most effective form of propaganda. In the bulletin of the
Jura Federation he declared "the Italian federation believes that the
insurrectional fact, destined to affirm socialist principles by deed, is the
most efficacious means of propaganda." As anarcho-communism emerged in the mid
19th century it had an intense debate with bakuninist collectivism and as such
within the anarchist movement over participation in syndicalism and the workers
movement as well as on other issues. So "In the theory of the revolution" of
anarcho-communism as elaborated by Peter Kropotkin and others "it is the risen
people who are the real agent and not the working class organised in the
enterprise (the cells of the capitalist mode of production) and seeking to
assert itself as labour power, as a more 'rational' industrial body or social
brain (manager) than the employers.". So "between 1880 and 1890" with the
"perspective of an immanent revolution," who was "opposed to the official
workers' movement, which was then in the process of formation (general Social
Democratisation). They were opposed not only to political (statist) struggles
but also to strikes which put forward wage or other claims, or which were
organised by trade unions." But "While they were not opposed to strikes as
such, they were opposed to trade unions and the struggle for the eight-hour
day. This anti-reformist tendency was accompanied by an anti-organisational
tendency, and its partisans declared themselves in favour of agitation amongst
the unemployed for the expropriation of foodstuffs and other articles, for the
expropriatory strike and, in some cases, for 'individual recuperation' or acts
of terrorism." But after Peter Kropotkin along others decided to enter labor
unions after their initial reservations, there remained "the anti-syndicalist
anarchist-communists, who in France were grouped around Sebastien Faure's "Le
Libertaire". From 1905 onwards, the Russian counterparts of these anti-
syndicalist anarchist-communists become partisans of economic terrorism and
illegal 'expropriations'." Illegalism as a practice emerged and within it "The
acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins ("propaganda by the deed") and the
anarchist burglars ("individual reappropriation") expressed their desperation
and their personal, violent rejection of an intolerable society. Moreover, they
were clearly meant to be exemplary, invitations to revolt." Proponents and
activists of these tactics among others included Johann Most, Luigi Galleani,
Victor Serge, Giuseppe Ciancabilla and Severino Di Giovanni. The Italian
Giuseppe Ciancabilla (1872‚Äì1904) wrote in "Against organization" that "we
don't want tactical programs, and consequently we don't want organization.
Having established the aim, the goal to which we hold, we leave every anarchist
free to choose from the means that his sense, his education, his temperament,
his fighting spirit suggest to him as best. We don't form fixed programs and we
don't form small or great parties. But we come together spontaneously, and not
with permanent criteria, according to momentary affinities for a specific
purpose, and we constantly change these groups as soon as the purpose for which
we had associated ceases to be, and other aims and needs arise and develop in
us and push us to seek new collaborators, people who think as we do in the
specific circumstance." Revolution, platformism and synthesism. In Ukraine the
anarcho-communist guerrilla leader Nestor Makhno led an independent anarchist
army in Ukraine during the Russian Civil War. A commander of the peasant
"Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine", also known as the "Anarchist
Black Army", Makhno led a guerrilla campaign opposing both the Bolshevik "Reds"
and monarchist "Whites". The revolutionary autonomous movement of which he was
a part made various tactical military pacts while fighting various forces of
reaction and organizing the Free Territory of Ukraine, an anarchist society,
committed to resisting state authority, whether capitalist or Bolshevik. After
successfully repelling Austro-Hungarian, White, and Ukrainian Nationalist
forces, the Makhnovists militia forces and anarchist communist territories in
the Ukraine were eventually crushed by Bolshevik military forces. In the
Mexican Revolution the Mexican Liberal Party was established and during the
early 1910s it lead a series of military offensives leading to the conquest and
occupation of certain towns and districts in Baja California with the
leadership of anarcho-communist Ricardo Flores Mag√≥n. Kropotkin's "The
Conquest of Bread", which Flores Mag√≥n considered a kind of anarchist bible,
served as basis for the short-lived revolutionary communes in Baja California
during the "Mag√≥nista" Revolt of 1911 A group of exiled Russian anarchists
attempted to address and explain the anarchist movement's failures during the
Russian Revolution. They wrote the "Organizational Platform of the General
Union of Anarchists" which was written in 1926 by "Dielo Truda" ("Workers'
Cause"). The pamphlet is an analysis of the basic anarchist beliefs, a vision
of an anarchist society, and recommendations as to how an anarchist
organization should be structured. The four main principles by which an
anarchist organization should operate, according to the "Platform", are
ideological unity, tactical unity, collective action, and federalism. The
platform argues that "We have vital need of an organization which, having
attracted most of the participants in the anarchist movement, would establish a
common tactical and political line for anarchism and thereby serve as a guide
for the whole movement". The Platform attracted strong criticism from many
sectors on the anarchist movement of the time including some of the most
influential anarchists such as Voline, Errico Malatesta, Luigi Fabbri, Camillo
Berneri, Max Nettlau, Alexander Berkman, Emma Goldman and Gregori Maximoff.
Malatesta, after initially opposing the Platform, later came to agreement with
the Platform confirming that the original difference of opinion was due to
linguistic confusion: "...I find myself more or less in agreement with their
way of conceiving the anarchist organisation (being very far from the
authoritarian spirit which the "Platform" seemed to reveal) and I confirm my
belief that behind the linguistic differences really lie identical positions."
Two texts were made by the anarchist communists Sebastian Faure and Volin as
responses to the Platform, each proposing different models, are the basis for
what became known as the organisation of synthesis, or simply "synthesism".
Voline published in 1924 a paper calling for "the anarchist synthesis" and was
also the author of the article in Sebastian Faure's "Encyclopedie Anarchiste"
on the same topic. The main purpose behind the synthesis was that the anarchist
movement in most countries was divided into three main tendencies: communist
anarchism, anarcho-syndicalism, and individualist anarchism and so such an
organization could contain anarchists of this 3 tendencies very well. Faure in
his text "Anarchist synthesis" has the view that "these currents were not
contradictory but complementary, each having a role within anarchism: anarcho-
syndicalism as the strength of the mass organisations and the best way for the
practice of anarchism; libertarian communism as a proposed future society based
on the distribution of the fruits of labour according to the needs of each one;
anarcho-individualism as a negation of oppression and affirming the individual
right to development of the individual, seeking to please them in every way.
The Spanish Revolution. The most extensive application of anarcho-communist
ideas (i.e., established around the ideas as they exist today and achieving
worldwide attention and knowledge in the historical canon), happened in the
anarchist territories during the Spanish Revolution In Spain, the national
anarcho-syndicalist trade union Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo initially
refused to join a popular front electoral alliance, and abstention by CNT
supporters led to a right wing election victory. But in 1936, the CNT changed
its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power.
Months later, the former ruling class responded with an attempted coup causing
the Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì1939). In response to the army rebellion, an
anarchist-inspired movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed
militias, took control of Barcelona and of large areas of rural Spain where
they collectivised the land. But even before the fascist victory in 1939, the
anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the Stalinists, who
controlled the distribution of military aid to the Republican cause from the
Soviet Union. The events known as the Spanish Revolution was a workers' social
revolution that began during the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 and
resulted in the widespread implementation of anarchist and more broadly
libertarian socialist organizational principles throughout various portions of
the country for two to three years, primarily Catalonia, Aragon, Andalusia, and
parts of the Levante. Much of Spain's economy was put under worker control; in
anarchist strongholds like Catalonia, the figure was as high as 75%, but lower
in areas with heavy Communist Party of Spain influence, as the Soviet-allied
party actively resisted attempts at collectivization enactment. Factories were
run through worker committees, agrarian areas became collectivised and run as
libertarian communes. Anarchist historian Sam Dolgoff estimated that about
eight million people participated directly or at least indirectly in the
Spanish Revolution, which he claimed "came closer to realizing the ideal of the
free stateless society on a vast scale than any other revolution in history."
Stalinist-led troops suppressed the collectives and persecuted both dissident
Marxists and anarchists. Economic theory. Anarcho-communism stresses
egalitarianism and the abolition of social hierarchy and class distinctions
arising from unequal wealth distribution, as well as the abolition of money and
private property (while retaining respect for personal property). Replacing
these outdated, harmful approaches would be collective production and
distribution of wealth by means of voluntary association. In anarchist
communism, the state and private property would no longer exist. Each
individual and group would be free to contribute to production and to satisfy
their needs based on their own choice. Systems of production and distribution
would be managed by their participants. The abolition of wage labor is central
to anarchist communism. With distribution of wealth being based on self-
determined needs, people would be free to engage in whatever activities they
found most fulfilling and would no longer have to engage in work for which they
have neither the temperament nor the aptitude. Anarchist communists argue that
there is no valid way of measuring the value of any one person's economic
contributions because all wealth is a collective product of current and
preceding generations. For instance, one could not measure the value of a
factory worker's daily production without taking into account how
transportation, food, water, shelter, relaxation, machine efficiency, emotional
mood etc. contributed to their production. To truly give numerical economic
value to anything, an overwhelming amount of externalities and contributing
factors would need to be taken into account¬ ‚Äì especially current or past
labor contributing to the ability to utilize future labor. As Kropotkin put it:
"No distinction can be drawn between the work of each man. Measuring the work
by its results leads us to absurdity; dividing and measuring them by hours
spent on the work also leads us to absurdity. One thing remains: put the needs
above the works, and first of all recognize the right to live, and later on, to
the comforts of life, for all those who take their share in production.."
Anarchist communists argue that any economic system based on wage labor and
private property requires a coercive state apparatus to enforce property rights
and to maintain unequal economic relationships that inevitably arise from
differences in wages or amount of property. They further argue that markets and
systems of currency divide labor into classes and assign arbitrary numerical
values to an individual's work and attempt to regulate production, consumption
and distribution. They argue that money restricts an individual's ability to
consume the products of their labor by limiting their intake with prices and
wages. Anarchist communists recognize money as fundamentally quantitative in
nature, rather than qualitative. They believe production should be a
qualitative matter, and that consumption and distribution should be self-
determined by each individual without arbitrary value assigned to labor, goods
and services by others. In place of a market, most anarcho-communists support a
currency-less gift economy where goods and services are produced by workers and
distributed in community stores where everyone (including the workers who
produced them) is essentially entitled to consume whatever they want or need as
"payment" for their production of goods and services. A gift economy does not
necessarily involve an immediate return (such as with remuneration);
compensation comes in the form of whatever the person decides is of equal value
to their products of labor (what is commonly called bartering). Any limits on
production and distribution would be determined by the individuals within the
groups involved, rather than by capitalist owners, corporations, investors,
banks or other artificial market pressures. Communist anarchism shares many
traits with collectivist anarchism but has defining differences. Collectivist
anarchism believes in collective ownership but communist anarchism negates the
entire concept of ownership in favor of the concept of usage. Thus, things are
seen as either private possessions used by an individual, or social possessions
used to produce for society. Anarcho-communists believe that means of
production should not be owned by any one person or entity, leaving it free to
be used by individuals for their own self-determined needs and wants. Land and
housing would no longer be subject to rent or property taxes (and therefore,
its use would be free of eviction threats). It would instead be subject simply
to the desires of occupants on an egalitarian basis. For example, in an
apartment building in which many live, no one person would have a say in the
arrangements. All who live there would be involved in decision-making. It's
typically argued that everyone should share certain responsibilities on a
revolving-door basis rather than relegate them to any particular individual.
This way, no one would get stuck doing labor considered relatively degrading.
Crucially, the abstract relationship of "landlord" and "tenant" would no longer
exist, as such titles are held to occur under conditional legal coercion and
are not absolutely necessary to occupy buildings or spaces. (Intellectual
property rights would also cease, since they are a form of private property.)
In addition to believing rent and other fees are exploitative, anarcho-
communists feel these are arbitrary pressures inducing people to carry out
unrelated functions. For example, they question why one should have to work for
'X hours' a day to merely live somewhere. So instead of working conditionally
for the sake of the wage earned, they believe in working directly for the
objective at hand. From this it follows that, rather than land being for sale
or rent, vacant land and housing would be freely taken regardless of one's
employment or financial status (essentially, the "for sale" sign could be
replaced by a "vacant" sign). Therefore, in anarcho-communist theory, land used
by individuals for themselves or their families, or productive property used to
produce for an individual (such as a small farm), would be considered private
possessions (personal property) rather than social possessions. The individual
would be perfectly free to create something and keep it as long as it is not a
crucial means of production for the community or general public. So an artist's
paintbrushes would not need outside approval to be utilized, and the same basic
principle would apply to other personal items such as one's toothbrush, musical
instruments or book collection, which others needn't tamper with. However, if
the matter at hand involves production for society (such as a factory which
makes toothbrushes, musical instruments or books), it would become a social
possession, accountable to all who work within it and the consuming public. In
that regard, anarcho-communism could be considered a compromise between
collective and individual use. Anarcho-communists reject mutualist economics
because they believe that market competition, even non-capitalist markets,
inherently create inequalities in wealth and land which would lead to
inequalities of power - thus the recreation of the State and capitalism as some
workers would have more access to capital and defence force than others. They
reject collectivist economics arguing that remuneration would require a type of
currency, which, again, anarcho-communists reject as an artificial measurement
of the value of labor. They further argue that those who are not part of
collective groups or unions in workers' councils and collectives could be
alienated from access to capital, and thus promote free common use over
ownership by society. Philosophical debates. Motivation. Anarchist communists
reject the claim that wage labor is necessary because people are by "nature"
lazy and selfish. They point out that even the so-called "idle rich" sometimes
find useful things to do despite having all their needs satisfied by the labour
of others. Anarcho-communists generally do not agree with the belief in a pre-
set 'human nature', arguing that human culture and behavior is very largely
determined by socialization. Many, like Peter Kropotkin, also believe that
human evolutionary tendency is for humans to cooperate with each other for
mutual benefit and survival instead of existing as lone competitors. While
anarchist communists Peter Kropotkin and Murray Bookchin believed that the
members of such a society would spontaneously perform all necessary labour
because they would recognize the benefits of communal enterprise and mutual
aid, others such as Nestor Makhno and Ricardo Flores Magon had the conviction
that all those able to work in an anarchist communist society should be
obligated to do so, excepting groups like children, the elderly, the sick, or
the infirm. Kropotkin did not think laziness or sabotage would be a major
problem in an authentically anarchist-communist society, but he did agree that
a freely associated anarchist commune could, and probably should, deliberately
disassociate from those not fulfilling their communal agreement to do their
share of work. Freedom, work and leisure. Anarchist communists support
communism as a means for ensuring the greatest freedom and well-being for
everyone, rather than only the wealthy and powerful. In this sense, anarchist
communism is a profoundly egalitarian philosophy. Anarchist communism as an
anarchist philosophy is against hierarchy in all its forms. Anarchist
communists do not think that anyone has the right to be anyone else's master,
or 'boss' as this is a concept of capitalism and the state and implies
authority over the individual. Some contemporary anarchist communists and
advocates of post-left anarchy such as Bob Black reject the concept of work
altogether in favor of turning necessary subsistence tasks into voluntary free
play. Peter Kropotkin said that the main authoritarian mistakes in communist
experiments of the past were their being based on "religious enthusiasm" and
the desire to live "as a family" where the individual had to "submit to the
dictates of a punctilious morality". For him anarcho-communism should be based
on the right of free association and dissasociation for individuals and groups
and on significantly lowering the amount of hours each individual dedicates to
necessary labor. He says that "to recognise a variety of occupations as the
basis of all progress and to organise in such a way that man may be absolutely
free during his leisure time, whilst he may also vary his work, a change for
which his early education and instruction will have prepared him ‚Äî this can
easily be put in practice in a Communist society ‚Äî this, again, means the
emancipation of the individual, who will find doors open in every direction for
his complete development." Individualism and collectivism. Some anarcho-
communists (and collectivist anarchists as well) reject "individualism" and
"collectivism" as illusory concepts. They argue that an individual sacrificing
themselves for the "greater good" or being ruled by the "community" or
"society" is not possible because society is composed of individuals rather
than being a cohesive unit separate from the individual, and argue that
collective control over the individual is tyrannical and un-anarchistic.
Others, such as Lucien van der Walt and Michael Schmidt, argue that: "The
anarchists did not ... identify freedom with the right of everybody to do
exactly what one pleased but with a social order in which collective effort and
responsibilities- that is to say, obligations- would provide the material basis
and social nexus in which individual freedom could exist." They argued that
"genuine freedom and individuality could only exist in a free society" and that
in contrast to "misanthropic bourgeois individualism" anarchism was based in "a
deep love of freedom, understood as a social product, a deep respect for human
rights, a profound celebration of humankind and its potential and a commitment
to a form of society where a 'true individuality' was irrevocably linked to
'the highest communist socieability'" Egoist philosophical positions are
important in anarcho-communist insurrectionary anarchism. In the early 20th
century the Italian individualist anarchist Renzo Novatore advocated both
revolution and anarcho-communism when he spoke that "revolution is the fire of
our will and a need of our solitary minds; it is an obligation of the
libertarian aristocracy. To create new ethical values. To create new aesthetic
values. To communalize material wealth. To individualize spiritual wealth.".
From Stirnerist positions he also disrespected private property when he said
that "Only ethical and spiritual wealth" was "invulnerable. This is the true
property of individuals. The rest no! The rest is vulnerable! And all that is
vulnerable will be violated!". This can also be seen in the contemporary
writings of insurrectionary anarchism, as can be seen in the work of Wolfi
Landstreicher, Alfredo Bonanno and others. Post-left anarcho-communist Bob
Black after analysing insurrectionary anarcho-communist Luigi Galleani's view
on anarcho-communism went as far as saying that "communism is the final
fulfillment of individualism...The apparent contradiction between individualism
and communism rests on a misunderstanding of both...Subjectivity is also
objective: the individual really is subjective. It is nonsense to speak of
‚Äúemphatically prioritizing the social over the individual,‚Äù...You may as
well speak of prioritizing the chicken over the egg. Anarchy is a ‚Äúmethod of
individualization.‚Äù It aims to combine the greatest individual development
with the greatest communal unity. On the article by Max Baginski called
"Stirner: The Ego and His Own" published in the American anarchist magazine
Mother Earth there is the following affirmation "Modern Communists are more
individualistic than Stirner. To them, not merely religion, morality, family
and State are spooks, but property also is no more than a spook, in whose name
the individual is enslaved - and how enslaved! The individuality is nowadays
held in far stronger bondage by property, than by the combined power of State,
religion and morality...The prime condition is that the individual should not
be forced to humiliate and lower himself for the sake of property and
subsistence. Communism thus creates a basis for the liberty and Eigenheit of
the individual. I am a Communist because I am an Individualist. Fully as
heartily the Communists concur with Stirner when he puts the word take in place
of demand - that leads to the dissolution of private property, to
expropriation. Individualism and Communism go hand in hand." Property.
Anarchist communists counter the capitalist conception that communal property
can only be maintained by force and that such a position is neither fixed in
nature nor unchangeable in practice, citing numerous examples of communal
behavior occurring naturally even within capitalist systems. Anarchist
communists call for the abolition of private property while maintaining respect
for personal property. As such the prominent anarcho-communist Alexander
Berkman maintained that "The revolution abolishes private ownership of the
means of production and distribution, and with it goes capitalistic business.
Personal possession remains only in the things you use. Thus, your watch is
your own, but the watch factory belongs to the people.Land, machinery, and all
other public utilities will be collective property, neither to be bought nor
sold. Actual use will be considered the only title-not to ownership but to
possession. The organization of the coal miners, for example, will be in charge
of the coal mines, not as owners but as the operating agency. Similarly will
the railroad brotherhoods run the railroads, and so on. Collective possession,
cooperatively managed in the interests of the community, will take the place of
personal ownership privately conducted for profit." The commune as an economic
democracy. Anarcho-communism has been critical of a simple call for worker¬¥s
ownership of workplaces and their administration as cooperatives. Murray
Bookchin has put it this way "what of the syndicalist ideal of "collectivized"
self-managed enterprises that are coordinated by like occupations on a national
level and coordinated geographically by "collectives" on a local level?...Here,
the traditional socialist criticism of this syndicalist form of economic
management is not without its point: the corporate or private capitalist,
"worker-controlled" or not"‚Äùironically, a technique in the repertoire of
industrial management that is coming very much into vogue today as "workplace
democracy" and "employee ownership" and constitutes no threat whatever to
private property and capitalism...In any case, "economic democracy" has not
simply meant "workplace democracy" and "employee ownership." Many workers, in
fact, would like to get away from their factories if they could and find more
creative artisanal types of work, not simply "participate" in "planning" their
own misery. What "economic democracy" meant in its profoundest sense was free,
"democratic" access to the means of life, the counterpart of political
democracy, that is, the guarantee of freedom from material want. It is a dirty
bourgeois trick, in which many radicals unknowingly participate, that "economic
democracy" has been re-interpreted as "employee ownership" and "workplace
democracy" and has come to mean workers' "participation" in profit sharing and
industrial management rather than freedom from the tyranny of the factory,
rationalized labor, and "planned production," which is usually exploitative
production with the complicity of the workers." As such "Whereas the
syndicalist alternative re-privatizes the economy into "self-managed"
collectives and opens the way to their degeneration into traditional forms of
private property - whether "collectively" owned or not - libertarian
municipalism politicizes the economy and dissolves it into the civic domain.
Neither factory or land appear as separate interests within the communal
collective. Nor can workers, farmers, technicians, engineers, professionals,
and the like perpetuate their vocational identities as separate interests that
exist apart from the citizen body in face-to-face assemblies. "Property" is
integrated into the commune as a material constituent of its libertarian
institutional framework, indeed as a part of a larger whole that is controlled
by the citizen body in assembly as citizens - not as vocationally oriented
interest groups." The revolution and the transition. For platformist anarcho-
communist Wayne Price "Today‚Äôs proposals for Parecon, in which workers are
rewarded for the intensity and duration of their labor in a cooperative
economy, would fit into Bakunin‚Äôs or Marx‚Äôs concept of a transitory,
beginning, phase, of a free society ... Kropotkin rejected the two-phase
approach of the Marxists and the anarchist-collectivists. Instead he proposed
that a revolutionary society should ‚Äútransform itself immediately into a
communist society,‚Äù that is, should go immediately into what Marx had
regarded as the ‚Äúmore advanced,‚Äù completed, phase of communism. Kropotkin
and those who agreed with him called themselves ‚Äúanarchist-communists‚Äù (or
‚Äúcommunist anarchists‚Äù), although they continued to regard themselves as a
part of the broader socialist movement." Marxist-Leninists believe that without
a transitionary period of state control (their interpretation of the
dictatorship of the proletariat) it would be impossible for any revolution to
maintain the momentum or cohesion to defend the new society against external
and internal threats. Friedrich Engels noted: "Without a previous social
revolution the abolition of the state is nonsense; the abolition of capital is
in itself the social revolution and involves a change in the whole method of
production." Alternatively, such quotations have been interpreted by Anarcho-
Communists supportive of Marx and Engels to suggest the abolition of capitalism
and the state simultaneously, not the creation of a new state. Anarchists
reject the Leninist model of the "dictatorship of the proletariat," arguing
that any revolutionary minority taking over state power would be just as
authoritarian as the ruling class in capitalism to defend the new state, and
would eventually constitute itself as a new ruling class. As an extension of
this, Anarcho-communists counter-argue that decentralized, stateless collective
federations are sufficient to give both power to workers and preserve personal
freedom and point to the fact that no socialist state has ever showed signs of
"withering away". Again, the Spanish Revolution is cited as an example of
successful anarchist military mobilisation, albeit one crushed by superior
forces. Free association of communes as opposed to the nation-state. Anarcho-
communism calls for a confederal form in relationships of mutual aid and free
association between communes as an alternative to the centralism of the nation-
state. Peter Kropotkin thus suggested that "Representative government has
accomplished its historical mission; it has given a mortal blow to court-rule;
and by its debates it has awakened public interest in public questions. But to
see in it the government of the future socialist society is to commit a gross
error. Each economic phase of life implies its own political phase; and it is
impossible to touch the very basis of the present economic life-private
property -without a corresponding change in the very basis of the political
organization. Life already shows in which direction the change will be made.
Not in increasing the powers of the State, but in resorting to free
organization and free federation in all those branches which are now considered
as attributes of the State." As such "no community can hope to achieve economic
autarchy, nor should it try to do so unless it wishes to become self-enclosed
and parochial, not only "self-sufficient." Hence the confederation of
communes"‚Äùthe Commune of communes"‚Äùis reworked economically as well as
politically into a shared universe of publically managed resources. The
management of the economy, precisely because it is a public activity, does not
degenerate into privatized interactions between enterprises; rather it develops
into confederalized interactions between municipalities. That is to say, the
very elements of societal interaction are expanded from real or potential
privatized components to institutionally real public components. Confederation
becomes a public project by definition, not only because of shared needs and
resources. If there is any way to avoid the emergence of the city-state, not to
speak of self-serving bourgeois "cooperatives," it is through a
municipalization of political life that is so complete that politics embraces
not only what we call the public sphere but material means of life as well."
Example societies through history. Early examples. There have been several
attempts, both successful and unsuccessful, at creating other anarchist-
communist societies throughout much of the world. Anarchist-communists and some
green anarchists (especially anarcho-primivists) argue that hunter-gatherer
tribes, like families, were early forms of anarchist-communism, due to their
egalitarian nature. Early Christian communities have been described as having
anarcho-communist characteristics. Frank Seaver Billings described "Jesusism"
as a combination of anarchism and communism. Examples of later Christian
egalitarian communities include the Diggers. Anarchist Spain and later
examples. The best known examples of an "anarchist communist" society,
established around the ideas as they exist today, that received worldwide
attention and knowledge in the historical canon, are the anarchist territories
during the Spanish Revolution and the Free Territory during the Russian
Revolution. Through the efforts and influence of the Spanish Anarchists during
the Spanish Revolution within the Spanish Civil War, starting in 1936 anarchist
communism existed in most of Aragon, parts of the Levante and Andalusia, as
well as in the stronghold of Anarchist Catalonia before being brutally crushed
by the combined forces of Francoism, Hitler, Mussolini, Spanish Communist Party
repression (backed by the USSR) as well as economic and armaments blockades
from the capitalist countries and the Spanish Republic itself. The Spanish
example, in which high levels of mobilisation and swift improvements to
production were implemented by anarchists, is often cited as an example of an
anarchist-communist society which saw rapid improvements to both industrial and
scientific output. While some exponents of capitalism believe that such a
society's productivity and technological progress would stagnate out of lack of
monetary incentives. During the Russian Revolution, anarchists such as Nestor
Makhno worked to create and defend- through the Revolutionary Insurrectionary
Army of Ukraine- anarchist communism in the Free Territory of the Ukraine from
1919 before being conquered by the Bolsheviks in 1921. Later movements include
the free territories of Hungary during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. Modern
examples. The Korean Anarchist Movement in Korea led by Kim Jwa Jin briefly
brought anarcho-communism to Korea. The success was short-lived and much less
widespread than the anarchism in Spain or Hungary. Some consider the current
existing anarchist nature of communities in Argentina and the Zapatista
councils in Mexico to be anarcho-communist. Others consider them to be
collectivist or syndicalist. Aspects of the Free Software community, like the
Free Software movement, the GNU Project and its copyleft principle are a type
of a gift economy for information and software; a gift economy is the preferred
economic system of anarcho-communists. Programmers make the source code of
their programs available for anyone to copy, modify and improve. Individual
programmers gain prestige and respect, and the community benefits from better
software. Markus Giesler, in his ethnography "Consumer Gift Systems", explored
music downloading as a system of social solidarity based on gift transactions.
Some organizations such as online commons (such as Wikipedia, the Wikimedia
Commons), wikis and Indymedia are held up as examples of functioning anarcho-
communistic organizations.
