Omaha Platform The Omaha Platform was the party program adopted at the
formative convention of the Populist (or People's) Party held in Omaha,
Nebraska on July 4, 1892. Significance of the Omaha Platform. The platform
preamble was written by Ignatius L. Donnelly. The planks themselves represent
the merger of the agrarian concerns of the Farmers' Alliance with the free-
currency monetarism of the Greenback Party while explicitly endorsing the goals
of the largely urban Knights of Labor. In the words of Donnelly's preamble, the
convention was "ssembled on the anniversary of the birthday of the nation, and
filled with the spirit of the grand general and chieftain who established our
independence, we seek to restore the government of the Republic to the hands of
the "plain people", with which class it originated." The Populist, or People's,
Party went on to capture 11 seats in the United States House of
Representatives, several governors and the state legislatures of Kansas,
Nebraska and North Carolina. 1892 Presidential nominee and former Greenbacker
James B. Weaver received over a million popular votes, and won four states
(Colorado, Kansas, Idaho, and Nevada) and 22 electoral votes. The Party's
legislative majorities were thereafter able to elect several United States
Senators. Taken as a whole, the electoral accomplishments of the Populist Party
represent the high water mark for a United States third party after the Civil
War. In 1896, the Populists abandoned the Omaha Platform and endorsed
Democratic nominee William Jennings Bryan on the basis of a single-plank free
silver platform.
