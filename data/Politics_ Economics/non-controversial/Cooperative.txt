Cooperative A cooperative ("coop"), co-operative ("co-op"), or co√∂perative
("co√∂p") is an autonomous association of persons who voluntarily cooperate for
their mutual social, economic, and cultural benefit. Cooperatives include non-
profit community organizations and businesses that are owned and managed by the
people who use its services (a consumer cooperative) and/or by the people who
work there (a worker cooperative) or by the people who live there (a housing
cooperative). Origins. Cooperation dates back as far as human beings have been
organizing for mutual benefit. Tribes were organized as cooperative structures,
allocating jobs and resources among each other, only trading with the external
communities. In alpine environments, trade could only be maintained in
organized cooperatives to achieve a useful condition of artificial roads such
as Viamala in 1472. Pre-industrial Europe is home to the first cooperatives
from an industrial context. In 1761, the Fenwick Weavers' Society was formed in
Fenwick, East Ayrshire, Scotland to sell discounted oatmeal to local workers.
Its services expanded to include assistance with savings and loans, emigration
and education. In 1810, Welsh social reformer Robert Owen, from Newtown in mid-
Wales, and his partners purchased New Lanark mill from Owen's father-in-law
David Dale and proceeded to introduce better labour standards including
discounted retail shops where profits were passed on to his employees. Owen
left New Lanark to pursue other forms of cooperative organization and develop
co-op ideas through writing and lecture. Cooperative communities were set up in
Glasgow, Indiana and Hampshire, although ultimately unsuccessful. In 1828,
William King set up a newspaper, "The Cooperator", to promote Owen's thinking,
having already set up a co-operative store in Brighton. The Rochdale Society of
Equitable Pioneers, founded in 1844, is usually considered the first successful
cooperative enterprise, used as a model for modern co-ops, following the
'Rochdale Principles'. A group of 28 weavers and other artisans in Rochdale,
England set up the society to open their own store selling food items they
could not otherwise afford. Within ten years there were over 1,000 cooperative
societies in the United Kingdom. Other events such as the founding of a
friendly society by the Tolpuddle Martyrs in 1832 were key occasions in the
creation of organized labor and consumer movements. Social economy. In the
final year of the 20th century, cooperatives banded together to establish a
number of social enterprise agencies which have moved to adopt the multi-
stakeholder cooperative model. Since 1994 the EU and its member nations, have
gradually revised national accounting systems to "make visible" the increasing
contribution of social economy organizations. Organizational and ideological
roots. The roots of the cooperative movement can be traced to multiple
influences and extend worldwide. In the Anglosphere, post-feudal forms of
cooperation between workers and owners, that are expressed today as "profit-
sharing" and "surplus sharing" arrangements, existed as far back as 1795. The
key ideological influence on the Anglosphere branch of the cooperative
movement, however, was a "rejection" of the charity principles that underpinned
welfare reforms when the British government radically revised its Poor Laws in
1834. As both state and church institutions began to routinely distinguish
between the 'deserving' and 'undeserving' poor, a movement of friendly
societies grew throughout the British Empire based on the principle of
mutuality, committed to self-help in the welfare of working people. Friendly
Societies established forums through which one member, one vote was practiced
in organisation decision-making. The principles challenged the idea that a
person should be an owner of property before being granted a political voice.
Throughout the second half of the nineteenth century (and then repeatedly every
20 years or so) there has been a surge in the number of cooperative
organisations, both in commercial practice and civil society, operating to
advance democracy and universal suffrage as a political principle. Friendly
Societies and consumer cooperatives became the dominant form of organization
amongst working people in Anglosphere industrial societies prior to the rise of
trade unions and industrial factories. Weinbren reports that by the end of the
19th century, over 80% of British working age men and 90% of Australian working
age men were members of one or more Friendly Society. From the mid-nineteenth
century, mutual organisations embraced these ideas in economic enterprises,
firstly amongst tradespeople, and later in cooperative stores, educational
institutes, financial institutions and industrial enterprises. The common
thread (enacted in different ways, and subject to the constraints of various
systems of national law) is the principle that an enterprise or association
should be owned and controlled by the people it serves, and share any surpluses
on the basis of each members' cooperative contribution (as a producer, labourer
or consumer) rather than their capacity to invest financial capital. The
cooperative movement has been fueled globally by ideas of economic democracy.
Economic democracy is a socioeconomic philosophy that suggests an expansion of
decision-making power from a small minority of corporate shareholders to a
larger majority of public stakeholders. There are many different approaches to
thinking about and building economic democracy. Both Marxism and anarchism, for
example, have been influenced by utopian socialism, which was based on
voluntary cooperation, "without" recognition of class conflict. Anarchists are
committed to libertarian socialism and they have focused on local organization,
including locally managed cooperatives, linked through confederations of
unions, cooperatives and communities. Marxists, who as socialists have likewise
held and worked for the goal of democratizing productive and reproductive
relationships, often placed a greater strategic emphasis on confronting the
larger scales of human organization. As they viewed the capitalist class to be
politically, militarily and culturally mobilized for the purpose of maintaining
an exploitable working class, they fought in the early 20th century to
appropriate from the capitalist class the society's collective political
capacity in the form of the state, either through democratic socialism, or
through what came to be known as Leninism. Though they regard the state as an
unnecessarily oppressive institution, Marxists considered appropriating
national and international-scale capitalist institutions and resources (such as
the state) to be an important first pillar in creating conditions favorable to
solidaristic economies. With the declining influence of the USSR after the
1960s, socialist strategies pluralized, though economic democratizers have not
as yet established a fundamental challenge to the hegemony of global neoliberal
capitalism. Meaning. Cooperatives as legal entities. A cooperative is a legal
entity owned and democratically controlled by its members. Members often have a
close association with the enterprise as producers or consumers of its products
or services, or as its employees. neither of which may be allowed under local
laws for cooperatives. Cooperatives often share their earnings with the
membership as dividends, which are divided among the members according to their
participation in the enterprise, such as patronage, instead of according to the
value of their capital shareholdings (as is done by a joint stock company).
Identity.
Cooperatives are dedicated to the values of openness, social responsibility and
caring for others. Such legal entities have a range of social characteristics.
Membership is open, meaning that anyone who satisfies certain non-
discriminatory conditions may join. Economic benefits are distributed
proportionally to each member's level of participation in the cooperative, for
instance, by a dividend on sales or purchases, rather than according to capital
invested. Cooperatives may be classified as either "worker", "consumer",
"producer", "purchasing" or "housing" cooperatives. They are distinguished from
other forms of incorporation in that profit-making or economic stability are
balanced by the interests of the community. Co-ops can sometimes be identified
on the Internet through the use of the .coop suffix of internet addresses.
Organizations using .coop domain names must adhere to the basic co-op values.
The United Nations has declared 2012 to be the International Year of
Cooperatives (IYC) Types of cooperative governance. Retailers' cooperative. A
retailers' cooperative (known as a secondary or marketing cooperative in some
countries) is an organization which employs economies of scale on behalf of its
members to receive discounts from manufacturers and to pool marketing. It is
common for locally owned grocery stores, hardware stores and pharmacies. In
this case the members of the cooperative are businesses rather than
individuals. The Best Western international hotel chain is actually a
retailers' cooperative, whose members are hotel operators, although it refers
to itself as a "nonprofit membership association." It gave up on the
"cooperative" label after some courts insisted on enforcing regulatory
requirements for franchisors despite its member-controlled status. Worker
cooperative. A worker cooperative or producer cooperative is a cooperative,
that is owned and democratically controlled by its "worker-owners". There are
no outside owners in a "pure" workers' cooperative, only the workers own shares
of the business, though hybrid forms exist in which consumers, community
members or capitalist investors also own some shares. In practice, control by
worker-owners may be exercised through individual, collective or majority
ownership by the workforce, or the retention of individual, collective or
majority voting rights (exercised on a one-member one-vote basis). A worker
cooperative, therefore, has the characteristic that the majority of its
workforce owns shares, and the majority of shares are owned by the workforce.
Membership is not always compulsory for employees, but generally only employees
can become members either directly (as shareholders) or indirectly through
membership of a trust that owns the company. The impact of political ideology
on practice constrains the development of cooperatives in different countries.
In India, there is a form of workers' cooperative which insists on compulsory
membership for all employees and compulsory employment for all members. That is
the form of the Indian Coffee Houses. This system was advocated by the Indian
communist leader A. K. Gopalan. In places like the UK, common ownership
(indivisible collective ownership) was popular in the 1970s. Cooperative
Societies only became legal in Britain after the passing of Slaney's Act in
1852. In 1865 there were 651 registered societies with a total membership of
well over 200,000. There are now more than 400 worker cooperatives in the UK,
Suma Wholefoods being the largest example with a turnover of ¬£24 million.
Spanish law permits owner-members to register as self-employed enabling worker-
owners to establish regulatory regimes that support cooperative working, but
which differs considerably from cooperatives that are subject to Anglo-American
systems of law that require the cooperative (employer) to view (and treat) its
worker-members as salaried workers (employees). The implications of this are
far-reaching, as this requires cooperatives to establish authority driven
statutory disciplinary and grievance procedures (rather than democratic
mediation schemes), impacting on the ability of leaders to enact democratic
forms of management and counter the authority structures embedded in the
dominant system of private enterprise centred around the entrepreneur.
Volunteer cooperative. A volunteer cooperative is a cooperative that is run by
and for a network of volunteers, for the benefit of a defined membership or the
general public, to achieve some goal. Depending on the structure, it may be a
collective or mutual organization, which is operated according to the
principles of cooperative governance. The most basic form of volunteer-run
cooperative is a voluntary association. A lodge or social club may be organized
on this basis. A volunteer-run co-op is distinguished from a worker cooperative
in that the latter is by definition employee-owned, whereas the volunteer
cooperative is typically a non-stock corporation, volunteer-run consumer co-op
or service organization, in which workers and beneficiaries jointly participate
in management decisions and receive discounts on the basis of sweat equity.
Social cooperative. A good estimate of the current size of the social
cooperative sector in Italy is given by updating the official Istituto
Nazionale di Statistica (Istat) figures from the end of 2001 by an annual
growth rate of 10% (assumed by the "Direzione Generale per gli Ente
Cooperativi"). This gives totals of 7,100 social cooperatives, with 267,000
members, 223,000 paid employees, 31,000 volunteers and 24,000 disadvantaged
people undergoing integration. Combined turnover is around 5 billion euro. The
cooperatives break into three types: 59% type A (social and health services),
33% type B (work integration) and 8% mixed. The average size is 30 workers.
Consumers' cooperative. A consumers' cooperative is a business owned by its
customers. Employees can also generally become members. Members vote on major
decisions and elect the board of directors from amongst their own number. The
first of these was set up in 1844 in the North-West of England by 28 weavers
who wanted to sell food at a lower price than the local shops. A well known
example in the United States is the REI (Recreational Equipment Incorporated)
co-op, and in Canada: Mountain Equipment Co-op. With its 414,383 employees,
7,736,210 members and a turnover of ‚Ç¨50Bn per year growing at a steady rate
of 4.41%, Legacoop of Italy is arguably the world's biggest federation of
cooperatives. The world's largest consumers' cooperative is the Co-operative
Group in the United Kingdom, which offers a variety of retail and financial
services. The UK also has a number of autonomous consumers' cooperative
societies, such as the East of England Co-operative Society and Midcounties Co-
operative. In fact, the Co-operative Group is something of a hybrid, having
both corporate members (mostly other consumers' cooperatives, as a result of
its origins as a wholesale society), and individual retail consumer members.
Japan has a very large and well-developed consumer cooperative movement with
over 14 million members; retail co-ops alone had a combined turnover of
2.519¬ trillion¬ Yen (21.184¬ billion¬ US¬ dollars exchange rates as of 15
November 2005) in 2003/4. Migros is the largest supermarket chain in
Switzerland and has around 2 million of the country's 7.2 million population as
members. Switzerland's second-biggest supermarket chain, Coop is also a
cooperative. In 2001, it merged with 11 cooperative federations which had been
its main suppliers for over 100 years. As of 2005, Coop operates 1,437 shops
and employs almost 45,000 people. According to Bio Suisse, the Swiss organic
producers' association, Coop accounts for half of all the organic food sold in
Switzerland. Euro Coop is the European Community of Consumer Cooperatives.
Business and employment cooperative. Business and employment cooperatives
(BECs) are a subset of worker cooperatives that represent a new approach to
providing support to the creation of new businesses. Like other business
creation support schemes, BECs enable budding entrepreneurs to experiment with
their business idea while benefiting from a secure income. The innovation BECs
introduce is that once the business is established the entrepreneur is not
forced to leave and set up independently, but can stay and become a full member
of the cooperative. The micro-enterprises then combine to form one multi-
activity enterprise whose members provide a mutually supportive environment for
each other. BECs thus provide budding business people with an easy transition
from inactivity to self-employment, but in a collective framework. They open up
new horizons for people who have ambition but who lack the skills or confidence
needed to set off entirely on their own ‚Äì or who simply want to carry on an
independent economic activity but within a supportive group context. New
generation cooperative. New generation cooperatives (NGCs) are an adaptation of
traditional cooperative structures to modern, capital intensive industries.
They are sometimes described as a hybrid between traditional co-ops and limited
liability companies. They were first developed in California and spread and
flourished in the US Mid-West in the 1990s. They are now common in Canada where
they operate primarily in agriculture and food services, where their primary
purpose is to add value to primary products. For example producing ethanol from
corn, pasta from durum wheat, or gourmet cheese from goat‚Äôs milk. Types of
cooperatives. Housing cooperative. A housing cooperative is a legal mechanism
for ownership of housing where residents either own shares (share capital co-
op) reflecting their equity in the cooperative's real estate, or have
membership and occupancy rights in a not-for-profit cooperative (non-share
capital co-op), and they underwrite their housing through paying subscriptions
or rent. Members of a building cooperative (in Britain known as a self-build
housing cooperative) pool resources to build housing, normally using a high
proportion of their own labour. When the building is finished, each member is
the sole owner of a homestead, and the cooperative may be dissolved. This
collective effort was at the origin of many of Britain's building societies,
which however, developed into "permanent" mutual savings and loan
organisations, a term which persisted in some of their names (such as the
former "Leeds Permanent"). Nowadays such self-building may be financed using a
step-by-step mortgage which is released in stages as the building is completed.
The term may also refer to worker cooperatives in the building trade. Utility
cooperative. A utility cooperative is a type of consumers' cooperative that is
tasked with the delivery of a public utility such as electricity, water or
telecommunications services to its members. Profits are either reinvested into
infrastructure or distributed to members in the form of "patronage" or "capital
credits", which are essentially dividends paid on a member's investment into
the cooperative. In the United States, many cooperatives were formed to provide
rural electrical and telephone service as part of the New Deal. "See Rural
Utilities Service". In the case of electricity, cooperatives are generally
either generation and transmission (G&T) co-ops that create and send power via
the transmission grid or local distribution co-ops that gather electricity from
a variety of sources and send it along to homes and businesses. In Tanzania, it
has been proven that the cooperative method is helpful in water distribution.
When the people are involved with their own water, they care more because the
quality of their work has a direct effect on the quality of their water.
Agricultural cooperative. Agricultural cooperatives or farmers' cooperatives
are cooperatives where farmers pool their resources for mutual economic
benefit. Agricultural cooperatives are broadly divided into "agricultural
service cooperatives", which provide various services to their individual
farming members, and "agricultural production cooperatives", where production
resources such as land or machinery are pooled and members farm jointly.
Agricultural production cooperatives are relatively rare in the world, and
known examples are limited to collective farms in former socialist countries
and the kibbutzim in Israel. Agricultural supply cooperatives aggregate
purchases, storage, and distribution of farm inputs for their members. By
taking advantage of volume discounts and utilizing other economies of scale,
supply cooperatives bring down members' costs. Supply cooperatives may provide
seeds, fertilizers, chemicals, fuel, and farm machinery. Some supply
cooperatives also operate machinery pools that provide mechanical field
services (e.g., plowing, harvesting) to their members. Agricultural marketing
cooperatives provide the services involved in moving a product from the point
of production to the point of consumption. Agricultural marketing includes a
series of inter-connected activities involving planning production, growing and
harvesting, grading, packing, transport, storage, food processing, distribution
and sale. Agricultural marketing cooperatives are often formed to promote
specific commodities. Commercially successful cooperatives include India's Amul
(dairy products) and Malaysia's FELDA (palm oil). Credit unions and cooperative
banking. Credit unions are cooperative financial institutions that are owned
and controlled by their members. Credit unions provide the same financial
services as banks but are considered not-for-profit organizations and adhere to
cooperative principles. Credit unions originated in mid-19th century Germany
through the efforts of pioneers Franz Hermann Schulze-Delitzsch and Friedrich
Wilhelm Raiffeisen. The concept of financial cooperatives crossed the Atlantic
at the turn of the 20th century, when the "caisse populaire" movement was
started by Alphonse Desjardins in Quebec, Canada. In 1900, from his home in
L√©vis, he opened North America's first credit union, marking the beginning of
the Mouvement Desjardins. Eight years later, Desjardins provided guidance for
the first credit union in the United States, where there are now about 7,950
active status federally insured credit unions, with almost 90 million members
and more than $679 billion on deposit. While they have not taken root so deeply
as in Ireland, credit unions are also established in the UK. The largest are
work-based, but many are now offering services in the wider community. The
Association of British Credit Unions Ltd (ABCUL) represents the majority of
British Credit Unions. British Building Societies developed into general-
purpose savings & banking institutions with "one member, one vote" ownership
and can be seen as a form of financial cooperative (although nine 'de-
mutualised' into conventionally owned banks in the 1980s & 1990s). The UK Co-
operative Group includes both an insurance provider CIS and the Co-operative
Bank, both noted for promoting ethical investment. Other important European
banking cooperatives include the Cr√©dit Agricole in France, Migros and Coop
Bank in Switzerland and the Raiffeisen system in many Central and Eastern
European countries. The Netherlands, Spain, Italy and various European
countries also have strong cooperative banks. They play an important part in
mortgage credit and professional (i.e. farming) credit. Cooperative banking
networks, which were nationalized in Eastern Europe, work now as real
cooperative institutions. A remarkable development has taken place in Poland,
where the SKOK ("Sp√≥ldzielcze Kasy Oszczednosciowo-Kredytowe") network has
grown to serve over 1 million members via 13,000 branches, and is larger than
the country‚Äôs largest conventional bank. In Scandinavia, there is a clear
distinction between mutual savings banks (Sparbank) and true credit unions
(Andelsbank). The oldest cooperative banks in Europe, based on the ideas of
Friedrich Raiffeisen, are joined together in the 'Urgenossen'. Federal or
secondary cooperatives. In some cases, cooperative societies find it
advantageous to form cooperative federations in which all of the members are
themselves cooperatives. Historically, these have predominantly come in the
form of cooperative wholesale societies, and cooperative unions. Cooperative
federations are a means through which cooperative societies can fulfill the
sixth Rochdale Principle, cooperation among cooperatives, with the ICA noting
that "Cooperatives serve their members most effectively and strengthen the
cooperative movement by working together through local, national, regional and
international structures." Cooperative wholesale society. According to
cooperative economist Charles Gide, the aim of a cooperative wholesale society
is to arrange ‚Äúbulk purchases, and, if possible, organise production.‚Äù The
best historical example of this were the English CWS and the Scottish CWS,
which were the forerunners to the modern Co-operative Group. Cooperative union.
A second common form of cooperative federation is a cooperative union, whose
objective (according to Gide) is ‚Äúto develop the spirit of solidarity among
societies and... in a word, to exercise the functions of a government whose
authority, it is needless to say, is purely moral.‚Äù Co-operatives UK and the
International Cooperative Alliance are examples of such arrangements.
Cooperative political movements.  In some countries with a strong cooperative
sector, such as the UK, cooperatives may find it advantageous to form political
groupings to represent their interests. The British Cooperative Party, the
Canadian Cooperative Commonwealth Federation and United Farmers of Alberta are
prime examples of such arrangements. The British cooperative movement formed
the Cooperative Party in the early 20th century to represent members of
consumers' cooperatives in Parliament, which was the first of its kind. The
Cooperative Party now has a permanent electoral pact with the Labour Party
meaning someone cannot be a member if they support a party other than Labour.
An alternative grouping, the Conservative Co-operative Movement is open to
people of all parties or none. UK cooperatives retain a significant market
share in food retail, insurance, banking, funeral services, and the travel
industry in many parts of the country.
