Interest articulation Interest articulation is a way for members of a society
to express their needs to a system of government. It can range from personal
contact with government officials to the development of interest groups (e.g.
trade unions, professional associations, religious groups) who act in the
interest of larger groups of people. Interest articulation can have different
effects in different types of government and can include both legal (i.e.:
lobbying, peaceful protest, phone calls and letters to policymakers) and
illegal activities (e.g. assassination, riots). Interest articulation leads to
interest aggregation.
