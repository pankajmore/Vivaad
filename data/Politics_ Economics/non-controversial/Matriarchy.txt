Matriarchy A matriarchy is a society in which females, especially mothers, have
the central roles of political leadership, moral authority, and control of
property. It is also sometimes called a gynocracy, a gynecocracy, or a
gynocentric society. The term for males is patriarchy, but it is not exactly a
parallel term. Most anthropologists hold that there are no known societies that
are unambiguously matriarchal, but possible exceptions include the Iroquois, in
whose society mothers exercise central moral and political roles. However, this
reluctance to accept the existence of matriarchies might be based on a
specific, culturally biased notion of how to define 'matriarchy': because in a
patriarchy 'men rule over women', a matriarchy has frequently been
conceptualized as 'women ruling over men', whereas in reality women-centered
societies are - largely without exception - egalitarian. There are also
matrilinear, matrilocal, and avunculocal societies, especially among indigenous
peoples of Asia and Africa, such as those of the Minangkabau, E De (Rhade),
Mosuo, Berbers and Tuareg and, in Europe, e.g., Sardinian people. Strongly
matrilocal societies sometimes are referred to as matrifocal, and there is some
debate concerning the terminological delineation between matrifocality and
matriarchy. Even in patriarchical systems of male-preference primogeniture,
there may occasionally be queens regnant. In 19th century Western scholarship,
the hypothesis of matriarchy representing an early stage of human
developmentâ€”now mostly lost in prehistory, with the exception of some so-
called primitive societiesâ€”enjoyed popularity. The hypothesis survived into
the 20th century and was notably advanced in the context of feminism and
especially second wave feminism, but this hypothesis of matriarchy as having
been an early stage of human development is mostly discredited today, most
experts saying that it never existed. Barbara Love and Elizabeth Shanklin, "The
Answer is Matriarchy," Mothering: Essays in Feminist Theory, edited by Joyce
Trebilcot (New Jersey: Rowman & Allanheld, 1984) Definitions and etymology. The
word "matriarchy" is often interpreted to mean the opposite of "patriarchy". It
is from Greek ' 'mother' and ' 'to rule'. Journalist Margot Adler wrote, "...
[""matriarchy"" means government by mothers, or more broadly, government and
power in the hands of women." "'Matriarchy' can be thought of ... as a
shorthand description for any society in which women's power is equal or
superior to men's and in which the culture centers around values and life
events described as 'feminine.'" In the Marxist tradition, it usually refers to
a pre-class society "where women and men share equally in production and
power." Some consider the term as not being parallel to "patriarchy", because
it is not always defined in the same fashion differing only for gender.
Matriarchy is also the public formation in which the woman occupies the ruling
position in a family (a primary cell of society). Matriarchy has even been
found where a quarter of Black families in the United States were headed by
single women; thus, families composing a substantial minority of a substantial
minority could be enough for the latter to constitute a matriarchy within a
larger non-matriarchal society (though many scholars would prefer the term
"matrifocal" to "matriarchal"). In addition, some authors depart from the
premise of a mother-child dyad as the core of a human group where the
grandmother was the central ancestress with her children and grandchildren
clustered around her in an extended family. According to Adler, "number of
feminists note that few definitions of the word [""matriarchy"", despite its
literal meaning, include any concept of power, and they suggest that centuries
of oppression have made it impossible for women to conceive of themselves with
such power." Etymologically, according to the OED, the word "matriarchy" is
first attested in 1885, building on an earlier "matriarch", formed in analogy
to patriarch, already in use in the early 17th century. By contrast,
"gynÃ¦cocracy", meaning 'rule of women', has been in use since the 17th
century, building on the Greek word found in Aristotle and Plutarch. The
Matriarchal Studies school led by Heide GÃ¶ttner-Abendroth calls for a more
inclusive redefinition of the term: GÃ¶ttner-Abendroth defines "Modern
Matriarchal Studies" as the "investigation and presentation of non-patriarchal
societies", effectively defining "matriarchy" as "non-patriarchy". She has also
defined "matriarchy" as characterized by the sharing of power equally between
the two genders. According to Diane LeBow, "atriarchal societies are often
described as ... egalitarian ...", although anthropologist Ruby Rohrlich has
written of "the centrality of women in an egalitarian society." Similarly,
Peggy Reeves Sanday (2004) favors redefining and reintroducing the word
"matriarchy", especially in reference to contemporary matrilineal societies
such as the Minangkabau. In "The Answer is Matriarchy," Barbara Love and
Elizabeth Shanklin, write, "Toward a Definition of Matriarchy, By 'matriarchy,'
we mean a non-alienated society: a society in which women, those who produce
the next generation, define motherhood, determine the conditions of motherhood,
and determine the environment in which the next generation is reared." Related
concepts. Gynecocracy, gynaecocracy, gynocracy, gyneocracy, and gynarchy.
"Gynecocracy", "gynaecocracy", "gynocracy", "gyneocracy", and "gynarchy"
generally mean 'government by women over women and men'. All of these words are
synonyms in their most important definitions. While these words all share that
principal meaning, they differ a little in their additional meanings, so that
"gynecocracy" also means 'women's social supremacy', "gynaecocracy" also means
'government by one woman', 'female dominance', and, derogatorily, 'petticoat
government', and "gynocracy" also means 'women as the ruling class'.
"Gyneocracy" is rarely used in modern times. None of these definitions are
limited to mothers. Some matriarchies have been described by historian Helen
Diner as "a strong gynocracy" and "women monopolizing government" and she
described matriarchal Amazons as "an extreme, feminist wing" of humanity and
that North African women "ruled the country politically," and, according to
Margot Adler, Helen Diner "envision a dominance matriarchy". Gynocentrism.
"Gynocentrism" (simplified by using the reduced prefix "gyno-" for "gynÃ¦co-")
is the 'dominant or exclusive focus on women', is opposed to androcentrism, and
"invert... the privilege of the ... [male/female binary ... feminists arguing
for 'the superiority of values embodied in traditionally female experience'".
Matrifocality and matricentrism. Due to a lack of a clear and consistent
definition of the word "matriarchy", several anthropologists have begun to use
the term "matrifocality." The terms "matrifocal" and "matricentric", 'having a
mother as head of the family or household', were first used in the mid 20th
century. Matrifocal societies are those in which women, especially mothers,
occupy a central position. The term does not necessarily imply domination by
women or mothers. Anthropologist R. L. Smith (2002) refers to "matrifocality"
as the kinship structure of a social system where the mothers assume structural
prominence. The Nair community in Kerala and the Bunt community in Tulunadu in
South India are prime examples of matrifocality. This can be attributed to the
fact that if males were largely warriors by profession, a community was bound
to lose male members at youth, leading to a situation where the females assumed
the role of running the family. Matristic. Feminist scholars and archeologists
such as Marija Gimbutas, Gerda Lerner, and Riane Eisler describe their notion
of a "woman-centered" society surrounding Mother Goddess worship throughout
prehistory (Paleolithic and Neolithic Europe) and ancient civilizations, by
using the term "matristic" rather than "matriarchal". Matrilineality.
Matrilineality is sometimes confused with historical matriarchy. Matrilocality.
Societies in which a couple resides close to the bride's family rather than the
bridegroom's family are termed "matrilocal" by anthropologists. History. Bronze
Age. Minoan Crete and Sumer were among the cultures existing during the Bronze
Age. According to Rohrlich, "scholars are convinced that Crete was a
matriarchy, ruled by a queen-priestess" and the "Cretan civilization" was
"matriarchal" before "1500 B.C.," when it was overrun and colonized. Also
according to Rohrlich, "n the early Sumerian city-states 'matriarchy seems to
have left something more than a trace.'" Native Americans. The Hopi Indian
tribe (in what is now the U.S.), according to Alice Schlegel, had as its
"gender ideology ... one of female superiority, and it operated within a social
actuality of sexual equality." According to LeBow (based on Schlegel's work),
in the Hopi, "roles ... are egalitarian ... [and sex is inferior." LeBow
concluded that Hopi women "participate fully in ... political decision-making."
According to Schlegel, "Hopi no longer live as they are described here" and "
[the attitude of female superiority is fading". Schlegel said the Hopi "were
and still are matrilinial" and "household ... was matrilocal". Schlegel
explains why there was female superiority as that the Hopi believed in "life as
the highest good ... [with the female principle ... activated in women and in
Mother Earth ... as its source" and that the Hopi "were not in a state of
continual war with equally matched neighbors" and "had no standing army" so
that "the Hopi lacked the spur to masculine superiority" and, within that, as
that women were central to institutions of clan and household and predominated
"within the economic and social systems (in contrast to male predominance
within the political and ceremonial systems)", the Clan Mother, for example,
being empowered to overturn land distribution by men if she felt it was unfair,
since there was no "countervailing ... strongly centralized, male-centered
political structure". 16th century. Some question whether a queen ruling
without a king is sufficient to constitute female government, given the
participation of other men in most such governments. One view is that it is
sufficient. "By the end of Elizabeth's reign, gynecocracy was a "fait
accompli"", according to historian Paula Louise Scalingi. Gynecocracy is
defined by Scalingi as "government by women", similar to dictionary definitions
(one dictionary adding 'women's social supremacy' to the governing role).
Scalingi reported arguments for and against the validity of gynocracy and said,
humanists treated the question of female rule as part of the larger controversy
over sexual equality." Possibly, queenship, because of the power wielded by men
in leadership and assisting a queen, leads to queen bee syndrome, contributing
to the difficulty of other women in becoming heads of the government. 18th
century. The Iroquois Confederacy or League, combining five to six American
Indian nations or tribes before the U.S. became a nation, operated by The Great
Binding Law of Peace, a constitution by which women participated in the
League's political decision-making, including deciding whether to proceed to
war, through what may have been a matriarchy or "'gyneocracy'". The dates of
this constitution's operation are unknown: the League was formed in
approximately 1000â€“1450, but the constitution was oral until written in about
1880. The League still exists. Doug George-Kanentiio, Iroquois Culture &
Commentary, New Mexico, Clear Light Publishers, 2000, pp. 53â€“55. 19th
century. The notion of matriarchy was defined by Joseph-Francois Lafitau
(1681â€“1746), who first named it "ginecocratie". The controversy surrounding
prehistoric or "primal" matriarchy began in reaction to the book by Johann
Jakob Bachofen "Mother Right: An Investigation of the Religious and Juridical
Character of Matriarchy in the Ancient World" in 1861. Several generations of
ethnologists were inspired by his pseudo-evolutionary theory of archaic
matriarchy. Following him and Jane Ellen Harrison, several generations of
scholars, usually arguing from known myths or oral traditions and examination
of Neolithic female cult-figures, suggested that many ancient societies might
have been matriarchal, or even that there existed a wide-ranging matriarchal
society prior to the ancient cultures of which we are aware. The concept was
further investigated by Lewis H. Morgan, LL. D. Many researchers studied the
phenomenon of matriarchy afterward, but the basis was laid by the classics of
sociology. In their works Bachofen and Lewis Morgan used such terms and
expressions as mother-right, female rule, gyneocracy, and female authority. All
these terms meant the same: the rule by females (mother or wife). The notion of
a "woman-centered" society was developed by J. J. Bachofen, whose three-volume
"Myth, religion, and mother right" (1861) impacted the way classicists such as
Jane Harrison, Sir Arthur Evans, Walter Burkert, and James Mellaart looked at
the evidence of matriarchal religion in pre-Hellenic societies. A claim of
"matriarchy" in the ancient Near East is also found in "The Cambridge Ancient
History" (1975): "the predominance of a supreme goddess is probably a
reflection from the practice of matriarchy which at all times characterized
Elamite civilization to a greater or lesser degree". The following excerpts
from Lewis Morgan's "Ancient Society" will explain the use of the terms: "In a
work of vast research, Bachofen has collected and discussed the evidence of
female authority, mother-right, and of female rule, gynecocracy." "Common lands
and joint tillage would lead to joint-tenant houses and communism in living; so
that gyneocracy seems to require for its creation, descent in the female line.
Women thus entrenched in large households, supplied from common stores, in
which their own gens so largely predominated in numbers, would produce the
phenomena of mother right and gyneocracy, which Bachofen has detected and
traced with the aid of fragments of history and of tradition." Although
Bachofen and Lewis Morgan confined the "mother right" inside households, it was
the basis of female influence upon the whole society. The authors of the
classics never thought that "gyneocracy" could mean 'female government' in
politics. They were aware of the fact that the sexual structure of government
had no relation to domestic rule and to roles of both sexes. The 19th-century
belief that matriarchal societies existed, a belief now abandoned among most
scholars, was due to the transmission of "economic and social power ... through
kinship lines" so that "in a matrilineal society all power would be channeled
through women. Women may not have retained all power and authority in such
societies ..., but they would have been in a position to control and dispense
power." Friedrich Engels, among others studying historical groups, formed the
notion that some contemporary primitive peoples did not grasp the link between
sexual intercourse and pregnancy. Research indicated that sexual intercourse
occurred from early ages and pregnancy only occurred much later, seemingly
unrelated to the sexual activity. He proposed that these cultures had no clear
notion of paternity, according to this hypothesis; women produced children
mysteriously, without necessary links to the man or men with whom they had sex.
When realization of paternity occurred, according to the hypothesis, men acted
to claim a power to monopolize women and claim their offspring as possessions
and patriarchy began. 20th century. "Their system of kinship is matrilineal,
and women hold a very good position, and wield great influence." "The
Trobrianders are matrilineal, that is, in tracing descent and settling
inheritance, they follow the maternal line. A child belongs to the clan and
village community of its mother, and wealth, as well as social position, are
inherited, not from father to son, but from maternal uncle to nephew." "As
regards kinship, the main thing to be remembered is that the natives are
matrilineal, and that the succession of rank, membership in all the social
groups, and the inheritance of possessions descend in the maternal line."
Property was succeeded inside the mother-line: "The ownership of trees in the
village grove and ownership in garden plots is ceded by the father to his son
during the lifetime of the former. At his death, it often has to be returned to
the man's rightful heirs, that is, his sister's children." A man had a life-
long obligation to work for women and their relatives in that society: "They
entail a life-long obligation of every man to work for his kinswomen and their
families. When a boy begins to garden, he does it for his mother. When his
sisters grow up and marry, he works for them. If he has neither mother nor
sisters, his nearest female blood relation will claim the proceeds of his
labour". By studying several different tribes of the Western Pacific (employing
the method of comparison, popular in ethnography), Malinowski gave
confirmations of Lewis Morgan's idea that matriarchy (gyneocracy) was a common
feature of primitive societies at early stages, and that female rule needed
matrilineality for its existence. He also confirmed that matrilineality often
goes hand in hand with promiscuous free love (a fact that was discovered by
Bachofen). "As a rule, amongst natives, a high position of women is associated
with sex laxity." "The sexual life of these natives Southern Massim tribe is
extremely lax. Even when we remember the very free standard of sex morals in
the Melanesian tribes of New Guinea, such as the Motu or the Mailu, we still
find these natives exceedingly loose in such matters. Certain reserves and
appearances which are usually kept up in other tribes, are here completely
abandoned. As is probably the case in many communities where sex morals are
lax, there is a complete absence of unnatural practices and sex perversions.
Marriage is concluded as the natural end of a long and lasting liaison."
"Trobrianders' sexual life starts long before puberty arrives, and gradually
shapes and develops as the organism matures... Chastity is an unknown virtue
among these natives. At an incredibly early age they become initiated into
sexual life... As they grow up, they live in promiscuous free-love, which
gradually develops into more permanent attachments... Marriage is associated
with hardly any public or private rite or ceremony. The woman simply joins her
husband in his house... In her married life, the woman is supposed to remain
faithful to her husband, but this rule is neither very strictly kept nor
enforced. In all other ways, she retains a great measure of independence."
Austrian writer Bertha Diener, also known as Helen Diner, wrote "Mothers and
Amazons" (1930), which was the first work to focus on women's cultural history.
Hers is regarded as a classic of feminist matriarchal study. Her view is that
in the past all human societies were matriarchal; then, at some point, most
shifted to patriarchal and degenerated. The controversy was reinforced further
by the publication of "The White Goddess" by Robert Graves (1948) and his later
analysis of classical Greek mythology and the vestiges of earlier myths that
had been rewritten after a profound change in the religion of Greek
civilization that occurred within its very early historical times. From the
1950s, Marija Gimbutas developed a theory of an "Old European culture" in
neolithic Europe which had matriarchal traits, replaced by the patriarchal
system of the Proto-Indo-Europeans with the spread of Indo-European languages
beginning in the Bronze Age. From the 1970s, these ideas were taken up by
popular writers of second-wave feminism and expanded with the speculations of
Margaret Murray on witchcraft, by the Goddess movement, and in feminist Wicca,
as well as in works by Elizabeth Gould Davis, Riane Eisler, and Merlin Stone.
The concept of a matriarchal golden age in the Neolithic Age has been denounced
as feminist wishful thinking in "The Inevitability of Patriarchy", in "Why Men
Rule", more recently by Philip G. Davis in "Goddess Unmasked" (1998), and by
Cynthia Eller, professor at Montclair State University, in "The Myth of
Matriarchal Prehistory" (2000). According to Eller, Gimbutas had a large part
in constructing a myth of historical matriarchy by examining Eastern Europe
cultures that she asserts, by and large, never really bore any resemblance in
character to the alleged universal matriarchy suggested by Gimbutas and Graves.
She asserts that in "actually documented primitive societies" of recent
(historical) times, paternity is never ignored and that the sacred status of
goddesses does not automatically increase female social status, and believes
that this affirms that utopian matriarchy is simply an inversion of
antifeminism. The feminist scenarios of Neolithic matriarchy have been called
into question and are not emphasized in third-wave feminism. The original
evidence recognized by Gimbutas, however, of Neolithic societies being more
egalitarian than the Bronze Age Indo-European and Semitic patriarchies remains
valid. Gimbutas herself has not described these societies as "matriarchal",
preferring the term "woman-centered" or "matristic". Del Giorgio, in "The
Oldest Europeans" (2006), insists on a matrifocal, matrilocal, matrilineal
Paleolithic society. While the existence of numerous matrilineal or avuncular
societies is undisputed, it has been recognized since the 1970s that there are
no societies which are matriarchal in the strong sense that some societies are
patriarchal. Joan Bamberger in her 1974 "The Myth of Matriarchy" argued that
the historical record contains no reliable evidence of any society in which
women dominated. Although in 1977 cultural anthropologist Jules de Leeuwe
argued that some societies were "mainly "gynecocratic"" (others being "mainly
"androcratic""), he did not identify any in his short response. Anthropologist
Donald Brown's list of "human cultural universals" ("i.e.", features shared by
all current human societies) includes men being the "dominant element" in
public political affairs (Brown 1991, p.Â 137), which he asserts is the
contemporary opinion of mainstream anthropology. Kurt Derungs is a non-academic
author advocating an "anthropology of landscape" based on allegedly matriarchal
traces in toponymy and folklore. 21st century. According to Adovasio, Soffer,
and Page, no true matriarchy is known actually to have existed, although there
is evidence of Amazons and an Amazonian society having existed and some
matrifocal societies do exist. Spokespersons for various indigenous peoples at
the United Nations and elsewhere have highlighted the central role of women in
their societies, referring to them as matriarchies, or as matriarchal in
character. According to interviewer Anuj Kumar, Manipur, India, "has a
matriarchal society", but this may not be a scholarly assessment. Mythology.
Greece and Rome. A legendary matriarchy related by classical Greek writers was
the Amazon society. Herodotus reported that the Sarmatians were descendants of
Amazons and Scythians, and that their females observed their ancient maternal
customs, "frequently hunting on horseback with their husbands; in war taking
the field; and wearing the very same dress as the men". Moreover, said
Herodotus, "o girl shall wed till she has killed a man in battle". Amazons came
to play a role in Roman historiography. Julius Caesar spoke of the conquest of
large parts of Asia by Semiramis and the Amazons. Although Strabo was sceptical
about their historicity, the Amazons were taken as historical throughout late
Antiquity. Several Church Fathers spoke of the Amazons as a real people.
Medieval authors continued a tradition of locating the Amazons in the North,
Adam of Bremen placing them at the Baltic Sea and Paulus Diaconus in the heart
of Germania. Historian Ronald Hutton has argued that there is no necessary
correlation between the worship of female deities and relative levels of social
or legal egalitarianism, noting the late classical Greek and Roman religions,
in which goddesses played important roles. The changes from the earlier
mythology are not considered in her analysis, however, and the late classical
myths were dominated by male deities. Hutton has also pointed out that, in more
recent European history, in 17th century Spain, there were many religious
institutions staffed exclusively by women. In Greek mythology, Zeus is said to
have swallowed his pregnant lover, the titan goddess Metis, who was carrying
their daughter, Athena. The mother and child created havoc inside Zeus. Either
Hermes or Hephaestus split Zeus's head, allowing Athena, in full battle armor,
to burst forth from his forehead. Athena was thus described as being "born"
from Zeus. Zeus was pleased with the outcome a prophecy that his son would
surpass him had not been fulfilled. Robert Graves suggested that this myth
displaced earlier myths that had to change when a major cultural change brought
patriarchy to replace a matriarchy. Apparently as criticism, about 2,400 years
ago, in 390 BCE, Aristophanes wrote a play, "Ecclesiazusae", about women
gaining legislative power and governing Athens, Greece, on a limited principle
of equality. In the play, Praxagora, a character, argues that women should rule
because they are superior to men, not equal, and yet she declines to assert
publicly her right to rule, although elected and although acting in office. The
play also suggests that women would rule by not allowing politics, in order to
prevent disappointment, and that affirmative action would be applied to
heterosexual relationships. In the play, written when Athens was a male-only
democracy where women could not vote or rule, women were presented as
unassertive and unrealistic, and thus not qualified to govern. The play was a
fable on the theme that women should stay home. Celtic myth and society. "here
"is" plenty of evidence of ancient societies where women held greater power
than in many societies today. For example, Jean Markale's studies of Celtic
societies show that the power of women was reflected not only in myth and
legend but in legal codes pertaining to marriage, divorce, property ownership,
and the right to rule." South America. Bamberger (1974) examines several
matriarchal myths from South American cultures and concludes that portraying
the women from this matriarchal period as evil often serves to restrain
contemporary women. In feminist thought. While "matriarchy" has mostly fallen
out of use for the anthropological description of existing societies, it
remains current as a concept in feminism. In first-wave feminist discourse,
either Elizabeth Cady Stanton or Margaret Fuller (it is unclear who was first)
introduced the concept of matriarchy and the discourse was joined in by Matilda
Joslyn Gage. Victoria Woodhull, in 1871, called for men to open the U.S.
government to women or a new constitution and government would be formed in a
year; and, on a basis of equality, she ran to be elected President in 1872.
Charlotte Perkins Gilman, in 1911 and 1914, argued for "[a woman-centered, or
better mother-centered, world" and described "'overnment by women'". She argued
that a government led by either sex must be assisted by the other, both genders
being "useful ... and should in our governments be alike used", because men and
women have different qualities. Cultural feminism includes "matriarchal
worship", according to Prof. James Penner. In feminist literature, matriarchy
and patriarchy are not conceived as simple mirrors of each other. While
"matriarchy" sometimes means "the political rule of women", that meaning is
often rejected, on the ground that matriarchy is not a mirroring of patriarchy.
Patriarchy is held to be about power over others while matriarchy is held to be
about power from within, Starhawk having written on that distinction and Margot
Adler having argued that matriarchal power is not possessive and not
controlling, but is harmonious with nature. For radical feminists, the
importance of matriarchy is that "veneration for the female principle ...
somewhat lightens an oppressive system." Feminist utopias are a form of
advocacy. According to Tineke Willemsen, "feminist utopia would ... be the
description of a place where at least women would like to live." Willemsen
continues, among "typeof feminist utopias[, ... stem[s from feminists who
emphasize the differences between women and men. They tend to formulate their
ideal world in terms of a society where women's positions are better than
men's. There are various forms of matriarchy, or even a utopia that resembles
the Greek myth of the Amazons... few modern utopias have been developed in
which women are absolute autocrats." Some fiction caricatured the current
gender hierarchy by describing a matriarchal alternative without advocating for
it. According to Karin SchÃ¶npflug, "Gerd Brantenberg's "Egalia's Daughters" is
a caricature of powered gender relations which have been completely reversed,
with the female sex on the top and the male sex a degraded, oppressed group";
"gender inequality is expressed through power inversion" and "all gender roles
are reversed and women rule over a class of intimidated, effeminate men".
""Egalia" is not a typical example of gender inequality in the sense that a
vision of a desirable matriarchy is created; "Egalia" is more a caricature of
male hegemony by twisting gender hierarchy but not really offering a 'better
world. Egalitarian models are also promoted. "deep distrust of men's ability to
adhere to" future matriarchal requirements may invoke a need "to retain at
least some degree of female hegemony to insure against a return to patriarchal
control", "feminists ... [having the understanding that female dominance is
better for societyâ€”and better for menâ€”than the present world order", as is
equalitarianism. On the other hand, if men can be trusted to accept equality,
probably most feminists seeking future matriarchy would accept an equalitarian
model. "Demographic", "feminist matriarchalists run the gamut" but primarily
are "in white, well-educated, middle-class circles"; many of the adherents are
"religiously inclined" while others are "quite secular". Biology as a ground
for holding either males or females superior over the other has been criticized
as invalid, such as by Andrea Dworkin and by . A claim that women have unique
characteristics that prevent women's assimilation with men has been apparently
rejected by Ti-Grace Atkinson. On the other hand, not all advocates based their
arguments on biology or essentialism. A criticism of choosing who governs
according to gender or sex is that the best qualified people should be chosen,
regardless of gender or sex. On the other hand, merit was considered
insufficient for office, because a legal right granted by a sovereign ("e.g.",
a king), was more important than merit. Diversity within a proposed community
can make it especially challenging to complete forming the community. However,
some advocacy includes diversity. Prof. Christine Stansell, a feminist, wrote
that, for feminists to achieve state power, women must democratically cooperate
with men. "must take their place with a new generation of brothers in a
struggle for the world's fortunes. Herland, whether of virtuous matrons or
daring sisters, is not an option... [The well-being and liberty of women cannot
be separated from democracy's survival." ("Herland" was feminist utopian
fiction by Charlotte Perkins Gilman, featuring a community entirely of women
except for three men who seek it out, strong women in a matriarchal utopia
expected to last for generations, although Charlotte Perkins Gilman was herself
a feminist advocate of society being gender-integrated and of women's freedom.)
Other criticisms of superiority are that it is reverse sexism or discriminatory
against men, it is opposed by most people including most feminists, women do
not want such a position, governing takes women away from family
responsibilities, women are too likely to be unable to serve politically
because of menstruation and pregnancy, public affairs are too sordid for women
and would cost women their respect, and femininity (apparently including
fertility), superiority is not traditional, it is impractical because of a
shortage of women with the ability to govern at that level of difficulty,
including the desire and ability to wage war, women legislating would not serve
men's interests or would serve only petty interests, it is contradicted by
current science on genderal differences, and it is unnatural. Pursuing a future
matriarchy would tend to risk sacrificing feminists' position in present social
arrangements, and many feminists are not willing to take that chance.
"Political feminists tend to regard discussions of what utopia would look like
as a good way of setting themselves up for disappointment" and argue that
immediate political issues must get the highest priorty. "'atriarchists'" as
typified by comic character Wonder Woman were criticized by Kathie Sarachild,
Carol Hanisch, and some others. In religious thought. Thealogy. Feminist
thealogy conceptualized humanity as beginning with "female-ruled or
equalitarian societies", until displaced by patriarchies, and that in the
millennial future "'gynocentric,' life-loving values" will return to
prominence. This produces "a virtually infinite number of years of female
equality or superiority coming both at the beginning and end of historical
time." Among criticisms is that a future matriarchy, as a reflection of
spirituality, is conceived as timeless and ahistorical, and thus may be
unrealistic or even meaningless as a goal to secular feminists. Many of what
are labeled as matriarchies may be labeled as matrifocal, matristic, or
gynocentric instead, thus lowering the number of true or narrowly-defined
matriarchies that existed in the past as models for the future. Parts of a
thealogical history of matriarchy may be unsupported by secular modern
historical scholarship.
