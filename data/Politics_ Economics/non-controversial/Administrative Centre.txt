Administrative centre An administrative centre is a term often used in several
unitary states to refer to a seat of regional administration or local
government, or a county town, or the place where the central administration of
a commune is located. In Russia, the term is applied to the inhabited
localities which serve as a seat of government of entities of various levels.
The only exception to this rule is the republics, for which the term "capital"
is used to refer to the seat of government. The capital of Russia is also an
entity to which the term "administrative centre" does not apply. In the United
Kingdom it is the centre of a local authority which is distinct from a historic
county with a county town.
