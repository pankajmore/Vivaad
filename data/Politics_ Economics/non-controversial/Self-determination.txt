Self-determination The right of nations to self-determination (from ), or in
short form, the right to self-determination is the cardinal principle in modern
international law principles of international law (jus cogens), binding, as
such, on the United Nations as authoritative interpretation of the Charterâ€™s
norms. It states that nations based on respect for the principle of equal
rights and fair equality of opportunity have the right to freely choose their
sovereignty and international political status with no external compulsion or
interference which can be traced back to the Atlantic Charter, signed on 14
August 1941, by Franklin D. Roosevelt, President of the United States of
America, and Winston Churchill, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom who
pledged The Eight Principal points of the Charter. The principle does not state
how the decision is to be made, or what the outcome should be, whether it be
independence, federation, protection, some form of autonomy or even full
assimilation. Neither does it state what the delimitation between nations
should be â€” or even what constitutes a nation. In fact, there are conflicting
definitions and legal criteria for determining which groups may legitimately
claim the right to self-determination. On 14 December 1960, the General
Assembly of the United Nations adopted United Nations General Assembly
Resolution 1514 (XV) under titled Declaration on the Granting of Independence
to Colonial Countries and Peoples provided for the granting of independence to
colonial countries and peoples in providing an inevitable legal linkage between
self-determination and its goal of decolonisation, and a postulated new
international law-based right of freedom also in economic self-determination.
In Article 5 states: Immediate steps shall be taken in Trust and Non-Self-
Governing Territories, or all other territories which have not yet attained
independence, to transfer all powers to the peoples of those territories,
without any conditions or reservations, in accordance with their freely
expressed will and desire, without any distinction as to race, creed or colour,
in order to enable them to enjoy complete independence and freedom, moreover on
15 December 1960 the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted United
Nations General Assembly Resolution 1541 (XV) under titled Principles which
should guide members in determining whether or nor an obligation exists to
transmit the information called for under Article 73e of the United Nations
Charter in Article 3 provided that nadequacy of political, economic, social or
educational preparedness should never serve as a pretext for delaying
independence. To monitor the implementation of Resolution 1514 in 1961 the
General Assembly created the Special Committee referred to popularly as the
Special Committee on Decolonization to ensure decolonisation complete
compliance with the principle of self-determination in the United Nations
General Assembly Resolution 1541 (XV), 12 Principle of the AnnexPrinciples
which should guide Members in determining whether or not an obligation exists
to transmit the information called for in article 73 e of the charter of the
United NationsPrinciple IThe authors of the Charter of the United Nations had
in mind that Chapter XI should be applicable to territories which were then
known to be of the colonial type. An obligation exists to transmit information
under Article 73 e of the Charter in respect of such territories whose peoples
have not yet attained a full measure of self-government.Principle IIChapter XI
of the Charter embodies the concept of Non-Self-Governing Territories in a
dynamic state of evolution and progress towards a "full measure of self-
government". As soon as a territory and its peoples attain a full measure of
self-government, the obligation ceases. Until this comes about, the obligation
to transmit information under Article 73 e continues.Principle IIIThe
obligation to transmit information under Article 73 e of the Charter
constitutes an international obligation and should be carried out with due
regard to the fulfilment of international law. Principle IVPrima facie there is
an obligation to transmit information in respect of a territory which is
geographically separate and is distinct ethnically and/or culturally from the
country adminÂ­istering it.Principle V Once it has been established that such a
prima facie case of geographical and ethnical or cultural distinctness of a
territory exists, other elements may then be brought into consideration. These
additional elements may be, inter alia, of an administrative, political,
juridical, economic or historical nature. If they affect the relationship
between the metropolitan Slate and the territory concerned in a manner which
arbitrarily places the latter in a position or status of subordination, they
support the presumption that there is an obligation to transmit information
under Article 73 e of the Charter.Principle VIA Non-Self-Governing Territory
can be said to have reached a full measure of self-government by:Â (a)
Emergence as a sovereign independent State;Â (b) Free association with an
independent State; or Â (c) Integration with an independent State.Principle
VIIÂ (a) Free association should be the result of a free and voluntary choice
by the peoples of the territory concerned expressed through informed and
democratic processes. It should be one which respects the individuality and the
cultural characÂ­teristics of the territory and its peoples, and retains for
the peoples of the territory which is associated with an independent State the
freedom to modify the status of that territory through the expression of their
will by democratic means and through constitutional processes. Â (b) The
associated territory should have the right to deterÂ­mine its internal
constitution without outside interference, in accordance with due
constitutional processes and the freely expressed wishes of the people. This
does not preclude conÂ­sultations as appropriate or necessary under the terms
of the free association agreed upon.Principle VIII Integration with an
independent State should be on the basis of complete equality between the
peoples of the erstwhile Non-Self-Governing Territory and those of the
independent country with which it is integrated. The peoples of both
territories should have equal status and rights of citizenship and equal
guarantees of fundamental rights and freedoms without any distinction or
discrimination; both should have equal rights and opportunities for
representation and effective participation at all levels in the executive,
legislative and judicial organs of government.Principle IX Integration should
have come about in the following circumÂ­stances :Â (a) The integrating
territory should have attained an advanced stage of self-government with free
political institutions, so that its peoples would have the capacity to make a
responsible choice through informed and democratic processes;Â (b) The
integration should be the result of the freely exÂ­pressed wishes of the
territory's peoples acting with full knowlÂ­edge of the change in their status,
their wishes having been expressed through informed and democratic processes,
imÂ­partially conducted and based on universal adult suffrage. The United
Nations could, when it deems it necessary, supervise these processes.Principle
XThe transmission of information in respect of Non-Self-Governing Territories
under Article 73 e of the Charter is subject to such limitation as security and
constitutional considerations may require. This means that the extent of the
information may be limited in certain circumstances, but the limitation in
Article 73 e cannot relieve a Member State of the obligations of Chapter XI.
The "limitation" can relate only to the quantum of information of economic,
social and educaÂ­tional nature to be transmitted.Principle XIThe only
constitutional considerations to which Article 73 e of the Charter refers are
those arising from constitutional relations of the territory with the
Administering Member. They refer to a situation in which the constitution of
the territory gives it self-government in economic, social and educational
matters through freely elected institutions. Nevertheless, the responsibility
for transmitting information under Article 73 e continues, unless these
constitutional relations preclude the Government or parliament of the
Administering Member from receiving statistical and other information of a
technical nature relating to economic, social and educational conditions in the
territory.Principle XIISecurity considerations have not been invoked in the
past. Only in very exceptional circumstances can information on economic,
social and educational conditions have any security aspect. In other
circumstances, therefore, there should be no necessity to limit the
transmission of Information on security grounds. defining free association with
an independent State, integration into an independent State, or independence as
the three legitimate options of full self-government compliance with the
principle of self-determination. By extension the term self-determination has
come to mean the free choice of one's own acts without external compulsion.
History. Pre-20th century. Origins. Just as colonisation and colonialism have
been practiced throughout recorded history, political self-determination, on an
individual level, has been documented similarly and cherished highly by
collective peoples despite them; ancient Mesopotamia and the later Greek city-
states are early examples of its practice. The employment of imperialism,
through the expansion of empires, and the concept of political sovereignty, as
developed after the Treaty of Westphalia, also explain the emergence of self-
determination during the modern era. During, and after, the Industrial
Revolution many groups of people recognized their shared history, geography,
language, and customs. Nationalism emerged as a uniting ideology not only
between competing powers, but also for groups that felt subordinated or
disenfranchised inside larger states, in this situation self-determination can
be seen as a reaction to imperialism. Such groups often pursued independence
and sovereignty over territory, but sometimes a different sense of autonomy has
been pursued or achieved. Empires. The world possessed several traditional,
continental empires such as the Ottoman, Russian, Austrian/Habsburg, and the
Qing Empire. Political scientists often define competition in Europe during the
Modern Era as a balance of power struggle, which also induced various European
states to pursue colonial empires, beginning with the Spanish and Portuguese,
and later including the British, French, Dutch, and German. During the early
19th century, competition in Europe produced multiple wars, most notably the
Napoleonic Wars. After this conflict, the British Empire became dominant and
entered its "imperial century", while nationalism became a powerful political
ideology in Europe. The Ottoman Empire, Austrian Empire, Russian Empire, Qing
Empire and the new Empire of Japan maintained themselves, often expanding or
contracting at the expense of another empire. All ignored notions of self-
determination for those governed. Rebellions and emergence of nationalism. The
revolt of New World British colonists in North America, during the mid-1770s,
has been seen as the first assertion of the right of national and democratic
self-determination, because of the explicit invocation of natural law, the
natural rights of man, as well as the consent of, and sovereignty by, the
people governed; these ideas were inspired particularly by John Locke's
enlightened writings of the previous century. Thomas Jefferson further promoted
the notion that the will of the people was supreme, especially through
authorship of the United States Declaration of Independence which inspired
Europeans throughout the 19th century. The French Revolution was motivated
similarly and legitimatized the ideas of self-determination on that Old World
continent. Within the New World during the early 19th century, most of the
nations of Spanish America achieved independence from Spain. The United States
supported that status, as policy in the hemisphere relative to European
colonialism, with the Monroe Doctrine. The American public, organized
associated groups, and even Congressional resolutions, often supported such
movements, particularly the Greek War of Independence (1821â€“29) and the
demands of Hungarian revolutionaries in 1848. Such support, however, never
became official government policy, due to balancing of other national
interests. After the American Civil War and with increasing capability, the
United States government did not accept self-determination as a basis during
its Purchase of Alaska and attempted purchase of the West Indian islands of
Saint Thomas and Saint John in 1860s, or its growing influence in the Hawaiian
Islands, that led to annexation in 1898. With its victory in the Spanish-
American War in 1899 and its growing stature in the world, the United States
supported annexation of the former Spanish colonies of Guam, Puerto Rico and
the Philippines, without the consent of their peoples, and it retained "quasi-
suzerainty" over Cuba, as well. Nationalist sentiments emerged inside the
traditional empires including: Pan-Slavism in Russia; Ottomanism, Kemalist
Ideology and Arab nationalism in the Ottoman Empire; State Shintoism and
Japanese identity in Japan; and Han identity in juxtaposition to the Manchurian
ruling class in China. Meanwhile in Europe itself there was a rise of
nationalism, with nations such as Greece, Hungary, Poland and Bulgaria seeking
or winning their independence. Karl Marx supported such nationalism, believing
it might be a "prior condition" to social reform and international alliances.
In 1914 Vladmir Lenin wrote: " would be wrong to interpret the right to self-
determination as meaning anything but the right to existence as a separate
state." World Wars I and II. Europe, Asia and Africa. Woodrow Wilson revived
America's commitment to self-determination, at least for European states,
during World War I. When the Bolsheviks came to power in Russia in November
1917, they called for Russia's immediate withdrawal as a member of the Allies
of World War I. They also supported the right of all nations, including
colonies, to self-determination." The 1918 Constitution of the Soviet Union
acknowledged the right of secession for its constituent republics. This
presented a challenge to Wilson's more limited demands. In January 1918 Wilson
issued his Fourteen Points of January 1918 which, among other things, called
for adjustment of colonial claims, as long as the interests of colonial powers
had equal weight with the claims of subject peoples. The Treaty of Brest-
Litovsk in March 1918 led to Russia's exit from the war and the independence of
Armenia, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Ukraine, Lithuania, Georgia and Poland. The
end of the war led to the dissolution of the defeated Austro-Hungarian Empire
and the creation by the Allies of Czechoslovakia and the union of the State of
Slovenes, Croats and Serbs and the Kingdom of Serbia as new states. However,
this imposition of states where some nationalities (especially Poles, Czechs,
and Serbs and Romanians) were given power over nationalities who disliked and
distrusted them eventually helped lead to World War II. The defeated Ottoman
empire was dissolved into the Republic of Turkey and several smaller nations,
including Yemen, plus the new Middle East Allied "mandates" of Syria and
Lebanon (future Syria, Lebanon and Hatay State), Palestine (future Transjordan
and Israel), Mesopotamia (future Iraq). The League of Nations was proposed as
much as a means of consolidating these new states, as a path to peace. During
the 1920s and 1930s there were some successful movements for self-determination
in the beginnings of the process of decolonization. In the Statute of
Westminster the United Kingdom granted independence to Canada, New Zealand,
Newfoundland, the Irish Free State, the Commonwealth of Australia, and the
Union of South Africa after the British parliament declared itself as incapable
of passing laws over them without their consent. Egypt, Afghanistan and Iraq
also achieved independence from Britain and Lebanon from France. Other efforts
were unsuccessful, like the Indian independence movement. And Italy, Japan and
Germany all initiated new efforts to bring certain territories under their
control, leading to World War II. In Asia, Japan became a rising power and
gained more respect from Western powers after its victory in the Russo-Japanese
War. Japan joined the Allied Powers in World War I and attacked German colonial
possessions in the Far East, adding former German possessions to its own
empire. In the 1930s, Japan gained significant influence in Inner Mongolia and
Manchuria after it invaded Manchuria. It established Manchukuo, a puppet state
in Manchuria and eastern Inner Mongolia. This was essentially the model Japan
followed as it invaded other areas in Asia and established the Greater East
Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. In 1912, the Republic of China officially succeeded
the Qing Dynasty, while Outer Mongolia, Tibet and Tuva proclaimed their
independence. Independence was not accepted by the government of China. By the
Treaty of Kyakhta (1915) Outer Mongolia recognized China's sovereignty.
However, the Soviet threat of seizing parts of Inner Mongolia induced China to
recognize Outer Mongolia's independence, provided that a referendum was held.
The referendum took place on October 20, 1945, with (according to official
numbers) 100% of the electorate voting for independence. Many of Eastern Asia's
current disputes to sovereignty and self-determination stem from unresolved
disputes from World War II. After its fall, the Empire of Japan renounced
control over many of its former possessions including Korea, Sakhalin Island,
and Taiwan. In none of these areas were the opinions of affected people
consulted, or given significant priority. Korea was specifically granted
independence but the receiver of various other areas was not stated in the
Treaty of San Francisco, giving Taiwan "de facto" independence although its
political status continues to be ambiguous. The Cold War world. The UN Charter.
In 1941 Allies of World War II signed the Atlantic Charter and accepted the
principle of self-determination. In January 1942 twenty-six states signed the
Declaration by United Nations, which accepted those principles. The
ratification of the United Nations Charter in 1945 at the end of World War II
placed the right of self-determination into the framework of international law
and diplomacy. However, the charter and other resolutions did not insist on
full independence as the best way of obtaining self-government, nor did they
include an enforcement mechanism. Moreover, new states were recognized by the
legal doctrine of uti possidetis juris, meaning that old administrative
boundaries would become international boundaries upon independence even if they
had little relevance to linguistic, ethnic, and cultural boundaries.
Nevertheless, justified by the language of self-determination, between 1946 and
1960, the peoples of thirty-seven new nations freed themselves from colonial
status in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. The territoriality issue
inevitably would lead to more conflicts and independence movements within many
states and challenges to the assumption that territorial integrity is as
important as self-determination. The communist versus capitalist worlds.
Decolonization in the world was contrasted by the Soviet Union's successful
post-war expansionism. Tuva and several regional states in Eastern Europe, the
Baltic, and Central Asia had been fully annexed by the Soviet Union during
World War II. Now, it extended its influence by establishing satellite states
in Eastern Germany and the countries of Eastern Europe, along with support for
revolutionary movements in China and North Korea. Although satellite states
were independent and possessed sovereignty, the Soviet Union often violated
principles of self-determination by suppressing the Hungarian revolution of
1956 and the Prague Spring Czechoslovak reforms of 1968. It invaded Afghanistan
to support an increasingly unpopular communist government assailed by local
tribal groups. However, Marxism-Leninism and its theory of imperialism were
also strongs influences in the national emancipation movements of third world
nations rebelling against colonial or puppet regimes. In many Third World
countries, communism became an ideology that united groups to oppose
imperialism or colonization. Soviet actions were countered by the United States
which saw communism as a menace to its interests. Throughout the cold war, the
United States created, supported, and sponsored regimes with various success
that served their economic and political interests, among them anti-communism.
To achieve this, a variety of means was implemented, including the
orchestration of coups, sponsoring of dictatorships and military invasions.
Consequently, many self-determination movements, which spurned some type of
anti-communist government, were accused of being Soviet-inspired or controlled.
Thus, the United States entered into a ten-year war in Vietnam, taking over
from French colonialists, and supported Portugal in its attempts to hold on to
Angola. The Rhodesian Bush War of the 1960s and 1970s pitted the unrecognized,
ardently anti-communist Rhodesian government, composed largely of the country's
minority whites, against rival groups of black guerrillas, aligned respectively
with Moscow and Beijing. The Chinese-backed Zimbabwe African National Union
eventually took power in 1980, when the internationally-recognised Republic of
Zimbabwe was formed. Asia. In Asia, the Soviet Union had already converted
Mongolia into a satellite state but abandoned propping up the Second East
Turkestan Republic and gave up its Manchurian claims to China. The new People's
Republic of China had gained control of mainland China in the Chinese Civil
War. The Korean War shifted the focus of the Cold War from Europe to Asia,
where competing superpowers took advantage of decolonization to spread their
influence. In 1947, India gained independence from the British Empire. The
empire was in decline but adapted to these circumstances by creating the
British Commonwealth-â€”since 1949 the Commonwealth of Nations-â€”which is a
free association of equal states. As India obtained its independence, multiple
ethnic conflicts emerged in relation to the formation of a statehood during the
Partition of India which resulted in Islamic Pakistan and Secular India. Before
the advent of the British, no empire based in mainland India had controlled any
part of what now makes up the country's Northeast, part of the reason for the
ongoing insurgency in Northeast India. In 1971 Bangladesh obtained independence
from Pakistan. Burma also gained independence from the British Empire, but
declined membership in the Commonwealth. Internal conflict in Burma that
challenge the ruling government persist. Indonesia gained independence from the
Netherlands in 1949 after the latter failed to restore colonial control. As
mentioned above, Indonesia also wanted a powerful position in the region that
could be lessened by the creation of united Malaysia. The Netherlands retained
Dutch New Guinea, but Indonesia threatened to invade and annex it. A vote was
supposedly taken under the UN sponsored Act of Free Choice to allow West New
Guineans to decide their fate, although many dispute its veracity. Later,
Portugal relinquished control over East Timor in 1975, at which time Indonesia
promptly invaded and annexed it. Sarawak and Sabah. Another controversial
episode with perhaps more relevance was the British beginning their exit from
British Malaya. An experience concerned the findings of a "United Nations
Assessment Team" that led the British territories of Sarawak and Sabah in 1963
to determine whether or not the populations wished to become a part of the new
Malaya Federation. The United Nation Team's mission followed on from an earlier
assessment by the British-appointed Cobbold Commission which had arrived in the
territories in 1962 and held hearings to determine public opinion. It also
sifted through 1600 letters and memoranda submitted by individuals,
organisations and political parties. Cobbold concluded that around two thirds
of the population favoured joining Malaysia while the remaining third wanted
either independence or continuing control by the United Kingdom. The United
Nations team largely confirmed these findings, which were later accepted by the
General Assembly, and both territories subsequently joined with the new
Federation of Malaysia. The conclusions of both the Cobbold Commission and the
United Nations team were arrived at without any referendums self-determination
being held. they sought to consolidate several of the previous ruled entities
then there was an agreement between the Philippines, Federation of Malaya and
Indonesia (31 July 1963) This also triggered the Indonesiaâ€“Malaysia
confrontation because Indonesia opposed the violation of the agreements. After
the Cold War. The Cold War began to wind down after Mikhail Gorbachev assumed
power in March 1985. With the cooperation of the American president Ronald
Reagan, Gorbachev wound down the size of the Soviet Armed Forces and reduced
nuclear arms in Europe, while liberalizing the economy. In 1989â€“90, the
communist regimes of Soviet satellite states collapsed in rapid succession in
Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Bulgaria, Romania, and Mongolia.
East and West Germany united, Czechoslovakia peacefully split into Czech
Republic and Slovakia, while in 1990 Yugoslavia began a violent break up into
its former 6 sub-unit republics. Kosovo, which was previously an autonomous
unit of Serbia declared independence in 2008, but has received less
international recognition. In December 1991, Gorbachev resigned as president
and the Soviet Union dissolved relatively peacefully into fifteen sovereign
republics, all of which rejected communism and most of which adopted democratic
reforms and free-market economies. Inside those new republics, four major areas
have claimed their own independence, but not received widespread international
recognition. After decades of civil war, Indonesia finally recognized the
independence of East Timor in 2002. In 1949, the Communists won the civil war
and established the People's Republic of China in Mainland China. The
Kuomintang-led Republic of China government retreated to Taipei, its
jurisdiction now limited to Taiwan and several outlying islands. Since then,
the People's Republic of China has been involved in disputes with the ROC over
issues of sovereignty and the political status of Taiwan. As noted, self-
determination movements remain strong in some areas of the world. Some areas
possess "de facto" independence, such as Taiwan, North Cyprus, Kosovo, and
South Ossetia, but their independence is disputed by one or more major states.
Significant movements for self-determination also persist for locations that
lack "de facto" independence, such as Kurdistan, Chechnya, and the State of
Palestine. Current issues. Since the early 1990s, the legitimatization of the
principle of national self-determination has led to an increase in the number
of conflicts within states, as sub-groups seek greater self-determination and
even full secession, and as their conflicts for leadership within groups and
with other groups and with the dominant state become violent. The international
reaction to these new movements has been uneven and often dictated more by
politics than principle. The year 2000 United Nations Millennium Declaration
failed to deal with these new demands, mentioning only "the right to self-
determination of peoples which remain under colonial domination and foreign
occupation." Defining "peoples". There is not yet a recognized legal definition
of "peoples" in international law. Vita Gudeleviciute of Vytautas Magnus
University Law School, reviewing international law and UN resolutions, finds in
cases of non-self-governing peoples (colonized and/or indigenous) and foreign
military occupation "a people" is the entire population of the occupied
territorial unit, no matter their other differences. In cases where people lack
representation by a state's government, the unrepresented become a separate
people. Present international law does not recognize ethnic and other
minorities as separate peoples. Other definitions offered are "peoples" being
self-evident (from ethnicity, language, history, etc.), or defined by "ties of
mutual affection or sentiment", i.e. "loyalty", or by mutual obligations among
peoples. Or the definition may be simply that a people is a group of
individuals who unanimously choose a separate state. If the "people" are
unanimous in their desire for self-determination, it strengthens their claim.
For example, the populations of federal units of the Yugoslav federation were
considered a people in the breakup of Yugoslavia, even though some of those
units had very diverse populations. Libertarians who argue for self-
determination distinguish between the voluntary nation (the land, the culture,
the terrain, the people) and the state, the coercive apparatus, which they have
a right to choose or self-determine. Self-determination versus territorial
integrity. National self-determination appears to challenge the principle of
territorial integrity (or sovereignty) of states as it is the will of the
people that makes a state legitimate. This implies a people should be free to
choose their own state and its territorial boundaries. However, there are far
more self-identified nations than there are existing states and there is no
legal process to redraw state boundaries according to the will of these
peoples. According to the Helsinki Final Act of 1975, the UN, ICJ and
international law experts, there is no contradiction between the principles of
self-determination and territorial integrity, with the latter taking
precedence. Pavkovic and Radan describe three theories of international
relations relevant to self-determination. Allen Buchanan, author of seven books
on self-determination and secession, supports territorial integrity as a moral
and legal aspect of constitutional democracy. However, he also advances a
"Remedial Rights Only Theory" where a group has "a general right to secede if
and only if it has suffered certain injustices, for which secession is the
appropriate remedy of last resort." He also would recognize secession if the
state grants, or the constitution includes, a right to secede. Vita
Gudeleviciute holds that in cases of non-self-governing peoples and foreign
military occupation the principle of self-determination trumps that of
territorial integrity. In cases where people lack representation by a state's
government, they also may be considered a separate people, but under current
law cannot claim the right to self-determination. On the other hand, she finds
that secession within a single state is a domestic matter not covered by
international law. Thus there are no on what groups may constitute a seceding
people. A number of states have laid claim to territories, which they allege
were removed from them as a result of colonialism. This is justified by
reference to Paragraph 6 of UN Resolution 1514(XV), which states that any
attempt "aimed at partial or total disruption of the national unity and the
territorial integrity of a country is incompatible with the purposes and
principles of the Charter". This, it is claimed, applies to situations where
the territorial integrity of a state had been disrupted by colonisation, so
that the people of a territory subject to a historic territorial claim are
prevented from exercising a right to self-determination. This interpretation is
rejected by many states, who argue that Paragraph 2 of UN Resolution 1514(XV)
states that "all peoples have the right to self-determination" and Paragraph 6
cannot be used to justify territorial claims. The original purpose of Paragraph
6 was "to ensure that acts of self-determination occur within the established
boundaries of colonies, rather than within sub-regions". Further, the use of
the word "attempt" in Paragraph 6 denotes future action and cannot be construed
to justify territorial redress for past action. An attempt sponsored by Spain
and Argentina to qualify the right to self-determination in cases where there
was a territorial dispute was rejected by the UN General Assembly, which re-
iterated the right to self-determination was a universal right. Methods of
increasing minority rights. In order to accommodate demands for minority rights
and avoid secession and the creation of a separate new state, many states
decentralize or devolve greater decision-making power to new or existing
subunits or even autonomous areas. More limited measures might include
restricting demands to the maintenance of national cultures or granting non-
territorial autonomy in the form of national associations which would assume
control over cultural matters. This would be available only to groups that
abandoned secessionist demands and the territorial state would retain political
and judicial control, but only if would remain with the territorially organized
state. Self-determination versus majority rule/equal rights. PavkoviÄ‡ explores
how national self-determination, in the form of creation of a new state through
secession, could override the principles of majority rule and of equal rights,
which are primary liberal principles. This includes the question of how an
unwanted state can be imposed upon a minority. He explores five contemporary
theories of secession. In "anarcho-capitalist" theory only landowners have the
right to secede. In communitarian theory, only those groups that desire direct
or greater political participation have the right, including groups deprived of
rights, per Allen Buchanan. In two nationalist theories, only national cultural
groups have a right to secede. Australian professor Harry Beran's democratic
theory endorses the equality of the right of secession to all types of groups.
Unilateral secession against majority rule is justified if the group allows
secession of any other group within its territory. Constitutional law. Most
sovereign states do not recognize the right to self-determination through
secession in their constitutions. Many expressly forbid it. However, there are
several existing models of self-determination through greater autonomy and
through secession. In liberal constitutional democracies the principle of
majority rule has dictated whether a minority can secede. In the United States
Abraham Lincoln acknowledged that secession might be possible through amending
the United States Constitution. The Supreme Court in Texas v White, held
secession could occur "through revolution, or through consent of the States."
The British Parliament in 1933 held that Western Australia only could secede
from Australia upon vote of a majority of the country as a whole; the previous
two-thirds majority vote for secession via referendum in Western Australia was
insufficient. The Chinese Communist Party followed the Soviet Union in
including the right of secession in its 1931 constitution in order to entice
ethnic nationalities and Tibet into joining. However, the Party eliminated the
right to secession in later years, and had anti-secession clause written into
the Constitution before and after the founding the People's Republic of China.
The 1947 Constitution of the Union of Burma contained an express state right to
secede from the union under a number of procedural conditions. It was
eliminated in the 1974 constitution of the Socialist Republic of the Union of
Burma (officially the "Union of Myanmar"). Burma still allows "local autonomy
under central leadership." As of 1996 the constitutions of Austria, Ethiopia,
France, Singapore, Saint Kitts and Nevis Republics have express or implied
rights to secession. Switzerland allows for the secession from current and the
creation of new cantons. In the case of proposed Quebec separation from Canada
the Supreme Court of Canada in 1998 ruled that only both a clear majority of
the province and a constitutional amendment confirmed by all participants in
the Canadian federation could allow secession. The 2003 draft of the European
Union Constitution allowed for the voluntary withdrawal of member states from
the union, although the State wanted to leave could not be involved in the vote
deciding whether or not they can leave the Union. There was much discussion
about such self-determination by minorities before the final document underwent
the unsuccessful ratification process in 2005. Drawing new borders. In
determining international borders between sovereign states, self-determination
has yielded to a number of other principles. Once groups exercise self-
determination through secession, the issue of the proposed borders may prove
more controversial than the fact of secession. The bloody Yugoslav wars in the
1990s were related mostly to borders issues because the international community
applied a version of uti possidetis juris in transforming existing internal
borders of the various Yugoslav republics into international borders, despite
the conflicts of ethnic groups within those boundaries. In the 1990s indigenous
populations of the northern two-thirds of Quebec state opposed to being
incorporated into a Quebec nation and even stated a determination to resist it
by force. The border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Free State was
based on the borders of existing counties and did not include all of historic
Ulster. A Boundary Commission was established to consider re-drawing it. Its
proposals, which amounted to a small net transfer to Northern Ireland, were
leaked to the press and then not acted upon. In December 1925, the governments
of the Irish Free State, Northern Ireland, and the United Kingdom agreed to
accept the existing border. Most Irish Nationalists and Irish Republicans claim
all of Northern Ireland and are not particularly interested in new borders.
Current movements. For past movements see list of historical autonomist and
secessionist movements and lists of decolonized nations. Also see list of
autonomous areas by country and list of territorial autonomies and list of
active autonomist and secessionist movements. Australia. Recently (2003
onwards), self-determination has become the topic of some debate in Australia
in relation to Aborigines (indigenous Australians). In the 1970s, the
Indigenous community approached the Federal Government and requested the right
to administer their own communities. This encompassed basic local government
functions, ranging from land dealings and management of community centres to
road maintenance and garbage collection, as well as setting education
programmes and standards in their local schools. Balochistan province. Since
1948, Baloch nationalists in Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan have been seeking
to separate Baloch majority regions of the three countries to form a new state
with the help of elements outside the aforementioned countries. The movement
has culminated in several armed uprisings in both Pakistan and Iran, that have
been crushed, especially during the 1970s inspired by Bengali nationalists. The
movement is strongest in Pakistan, where it is led by the Balochistan National
Party Balochistan Liberation Army and the Baloch Students Organization. This is
supported by arch-rival countries such as the Republic of India and Bangladesh.
Basque Country. The Basque Country (, , ) as a cultural region (not to be
confused with the homonym Autonomous Community of the Basque country) is a
European region in the western Pyrenees that spans the border between France
and Spain, on the Atlantic coast. It comprises the autonomous communities of
the Basque Country and Navarre in Spain and the Northern Basque Country in
France. Since the 19th century, Basque nationalism has demanded the right of
some kind of self-determination. This desire for independence is particularly
stressed among leftist Basque nationalists. The right of self-determination was
asserted by the Basque Parliament in 1990, 2002 and 2006. Since self-
determination is not recognized in the Spanish Constitution of 1978, some
Basques abstained and some even voted against it in the referendum of December
6 of that year. However, it was approved by a clear majority at the Spanish
level, and with 74,6% of the votes in the Basque Country. The derived
autonomous regimes for the BAC was approved in later referendum but the
autonomy of Navarre ("amejoramiento del fuero": "improvement of the charter")
was never subject to referendum but just approved by the Navarrese Cortes
(parliament). There are not many sources on the issue for the French Basque
country. "Euskadi Ta Askatasuna" (ETA) or ETA (; pronounced ), is an armed
Basque nationalist and separatist organization. Founded in 1959, it evolved
from a group advocating traditional cultural ways to a paramilitary group with
the goal of Basque independence. Its ideology is Marxist-Leninist. Biafra.
After years of ethnic friction culminating in the massacre of the Ibos in the
Northern and Western Nigeria between 1966 and 1967 in which an estimated
population of 500,000 Easterners were killed in a planned pogrom, the Eastern
Region headed by Lt Col Odumegwu Ojukwu started a secessionist movement in
Nigeria which resulted in the creation of the Republic of Biafra to protect the
Easterners from annihilation. The inhabitants were mostly the Igbo people who
led the secession due to economic, ethnic, cultural and religious tensions.
This led to the Nigerian Civil War which would have been avoided if the
Nigerian leaders had not violated the Aburi Accord 1967 made between the
Biafrans and the Nigerians which guaranteed self-governance to the then four
geopolitical regions. After initial military gains, the Biafran forces were
pushed back and in 1970 Biafra was reabsorbed into Nigeria after an estimated
population of 3 million Biafrans including women and children had been killed
through the war starvation policy of the Nigerian Government. The meaning of
the word "Biafra" has been explained in the Book, "Biafra or Nigerian
Presidency: What the Ibos Want" where the author delved into the etimology and
etiology of the words "Biafra", "Ibo" and "Igbo" and proved that "Biafra" is an
ancient word in the Igbo language which was lost many centuries ago just like
other Igbo words have been lost. The word "Biafra" appeared for the first time
in the ancient map of Africa drawn by the Portuguese from 1492 to 1729 when it
was spelt as Biafara, Biafar, and Biafares. It was in 1843 that the country was
spelt as BIAFRA encompassing the lower Niger River and parts of the present day
Cameroon, Gabon and Equatorial Guinea. From 1999 to the present day, the
indigenous people of Biafra have been agitating for independence to revive
their ancient country. They have registered a human rights organization known
as Bilie Human Rights Initiative both in Nigeria and in the United Nations to
advocate for their right to self-determination and achieve independence by the
rule of law. In addition, they have revived the Radio Biafra as a powerful
media tool to educate their people. In recent times a public debate has started
in the media on the rights of the indigenous people of Biafra. In response to
those opposing the independence of Biafra, the solicitor for the indigenous
people of Biafra made a strong argument in both national and international law
asserting that what Nigeria got after the Biafra War of Independence was a
military conquest and not a political victory. He submitted that what Biafra
lost after the war was its sovereignty and not its people and therefore the
remnants who were not consumed by the war are still protected under the law to
exercise their right to self-determination as indigenous people of Biafra.
Thus, the quest to revive Biafra is gathering momentum both at national and
international levels as it is now being championed by legal methods. At the
moment, Nigeria is made up of six geopolitical regions which are capable of
self-governance. In recent times, separatist aspirations have been growing
again in Nigeria, not only by the indigenous people of Biafra but also by other
ethnic groups both in the North and in the South, giving a clear sign that
Nigeria may not remain the same, but will either be restructured to guarantee
self-governance to the six geopolitical regions similar to the Aburi Accord
1967 or break up, disintegrate and go into oblivion like one of the ancient
empires we read in history. Canada. In Canada, many in the province of Quebec
have wanted the province to separate from Confederation. The Parti Quebecois
has asserted Quebec's "right to self-determination." There is debate on under
which conditions would this right be realized. French Canadian nationalism and
support for maintaining French Canadian culture would inspire Quebec
nationalists, many of whom were supporters of the Quebec sovereignty movement
during the late-20th century. Catalan Countries. PaÃ¯sos Catalans (in Catalan,
often literally translated into English as "Catalan Countries") refers to the
territories where Catalan language is historically spoken. These correspond
with some parts of the medieval Crown of Aragon (concretely Catalonia, Balearic
Islands, Valencia and La Franja in Spain, Northern Catalonia in France, the
city of Alghero in Italy, and Andorra). Today there are movements supporting
the independence of the Catalan Countries in both Spain and France, but they
only have significant support in Catalonia. Some of political parties from
Catalonia, the Valencian Country and the Balearic Islands that follow this idea
are the Republican Left of Catalonia, Catalan Solidarity for Independence (SI),
Rally for Independence and Republican Left of the Valencian Country, Estat
CatalÃ , Partit RepublicÃ  CatalÃ , Popular Unity Candidates, Valencian
Nationalist Bloc, Bloc per Mallorca, etc. Furthermore, there are other Catalan
groups and movements that seek the independence of the Catalan Countries as a
whole, such as: Sobirania i ProgrÃ©s, Deu Mil per l'autodeterminaciÃ³,
Catalunya Estat Lliure, Sobirania Valenciana, etc. All these political parties
and movements believe in non-violence and express their ideas in a non-violent
manner. Recently, there have been a series of non-binding, unofficial referenda
or "popular votes" (consultes populars, in Catalan, a binding referendum for
independence is illegal in Spain) held in municipalities around Catalonia, in
which voters indicated whether they support Catalan independence from Spain.
They began on 13 September 2009 in the town of Arenys de Munt in a self-
organised local movement and was then followed by a slew of Catalan
municipalities. As an example of the positive results obtained everywhere, 90%
of ballots cast in Barcelona on 11 April 2011 voted yes to independence. The
number of voters was 230,590, representing 21.37% of the voting population.
These referenda are still ongoing, as there is slated to be a second round in
2011â€“2012. Chechnya. Under Dzhokkar Dudayev, Chechnya declared independence
as the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, using self-determination, Russia's history
of bad treatment of Chechens, and a history of independence before invasion by
Russia as main motives. Russia has restored control over Chechnya, but the
separatist government functions still in exile, though it has been split into
two entities: the Achmed Zakayev-run secular Chechen Republic (based in Poland,
the UK and the USA), and the Islamic Caucasus Emirate. Falkland Islands. Self-
determination is referred to in the Falkland Islands Constitution and is a
factor in the Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute. The population has existed
for over nine generations, continuously for over 175 years. In a 1986 poll,
94.5% of the population voted to remain British. As administering power, the
British Government considers since the majority of inhabitants wish to remain
British, transfer of sovereignty to Argentina would be counter to their right
to self-determination. Argentina argues self-determination is not applicable,
asserting the current inhabitants are ""descendants of Britains who had been
sent there after the original inhabitants had been expelled"". This refers to
the re-establishment of British rule in the year 1833 during which Argentina
states the existing population living in the islands was expelled. Argentina
thus argues that, in the case of the Falkland Islands, the principle of
territorial integrity should have precedence over self-determination. Historian
Mary Cawkell considers that contemporary records historical indicate the
population was encouraged to remain, and that only a garrison was expelled.
Other authors state that the Argentine inhabitants were in fact expelled by the
British. Harper claims that no attempt to colonise the islands was made till
1841. Israel and Palestinian territories. The right to self-determination as
outlined in public international law is often referenced by both sides in the
ongoing Israel-Palestinian conflict. Jammu and Kashmir. United Nations Security
Council Resolution 47, adopted in 1948, called for a plebiscite to decide the
fate of Kashmir. The All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC), an alliance of 26
organizations in Kashmir seeks self-determination according to the UN
resolution. Some groups have suggested that a third option of Independence be
added to the resolutions two options of union with India or union with
Pakistan. Kosovo. Kosovo is a largely ethnic-Albanian nation (Albanians 88%,
Serbs 6%, Bosniaks 3%, Roma 2%, Turks 1%), which seeks independence on
territories long held by ethnic Serbs, including as part of Yugoslavia.
Conflict between the two culminated in the 1996-1999 Kosovo War between the
Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) and the then Federal Republic of Yugoslavia led by
Slobodan MiloÅ¡eviÄ‡. This culminated in the 1999 United States/NATO attacks on
Serbia, withdrawal of Serbian troops and entry of the NATO Kosovo Force.
International negotiations to determine the final status of Kosovo were
unsuccessful. On 17 February 2008, 109 members (10 members including all Kosovo
Serbs were absent) of the Kosovo Assembly voted unanimously to declare
independence. Serbia rejected the decision. Kosovo independence is disputed and
supervised by the international community following the conclusion of the
political process to determine Kosovo's final status envisaged in UN Security
Council Resolution 1244. See the 2008 Kosovo declaration of independence. In
February 2008 Europe's major powers and the United States recognised
independence of Kosovo. The independence of Kosovo has been recognized by . The
territory of Kosovo is the subject of a dispute between Serbia and the
Government of Kosovo. On 22 July 2010, the International Court of Justice gave
the following advisory opinion: "The declaration of independence of Kosovo
adopted on 17 February 2008 did not violate international law." Kurdistan.
Kurdistan is a historical region primarily inhabited by the Kurdish people of
the middle east. The territory is currently part of 4 states Turkey, Iraq,
Syria and Iran. There are Kurdish self-determination movements in each of the 4
states. Iraqi Kurdistan has to date achieved the largest degree of self-
determination through the formation of the Kurdistan Regional Government, an
entity recognised by the Iraqi Federal Constitution. Although the right of the
creation of a Kurdish state was recognized following World War I in the Treaty
of SÃ¨vres, the treaty was then annulled by the Treaty of Lausanne. To date two
separate Kurdish republics and one Kurdish Kingdom have declared sovereignty.
The Republic of Ararat (AÄŸrÄ± Province, Turkey), the Republic of Mehabad (West
Azerbaijan Province, Iran) and the Kingdom of Kurdistan (Sulaymaniyah Province,
Iraqi Kurdistan, Iraq), each of these fledgling states was crushed by military
intervention. The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan which currently holds the Iraqi
presidency and the Kurdistan Democratic Party which governs the Kurdistan
Regional Government both explicitly commit themselves to the development of
Kurdish self-determination, but opinions vary as to the question of self-
determination sought within the current borders and countries. Nagorno
Kharabagh. The Nagorno-Karabakh region of the Republic of Azerbaijan is part of
the geographical area called Garabagh (QarabaÄŸ). The name of this part of the
country consists of two Azerbaijani words: â€œqaraâ€ (black) and â€œbaÄŸâ€
(garden). However, the majority Armenian population of the region refers to it
by its previous Armenian name, Artsakh. As far as the right of peoples to self-
determination is concerned, it is well known that, in reality, the practical
realization of this right, as stipulated in the relevant international
documents, does not involve unilateral secession, but represents a legitimate
process carried out in accordance with international and domestic law within
precisely identified limits. There are two critical factors to be addressed in
the issue of Nagorno-Karabakh. Firstly, it is the extent of self-determination
a people are given to protect themselves and determine how they wish to be
ruled and what role is played by human rights violations, cultural eradication
and pogroms by the Azerbaijani majority against the Armenian communities of
Azerbaijan in a decision. Secondly, one must regard the question of legality of
unconstitutional acts, such as violating the territorial integrity of
Azerbaijan. Other considerations of the rules of international law,
particularly those prohibiting the use of force and the acquisition of
territory, are also relevant in that the Soviet authorities and, subsequently,
the Azerbaijani government applied use of military and paramilitary force in
ethnic cleansing initiatives like Operation Ring, while the Armenian community
of Nagorno-Karabakh established militia forces to resist further pogroms and
defend the civilian population by repelling Azeri forces. New Zealand.
Secession movements have surfaced several times in the South Island of New
Zealand. The Prime Minister of New Zealand, Sir Julius Vogel, was among the
first people to make this call, which was voted on by the Parliament of New
Zealand as early as 1865. The desire for South Island independence was one of
the main factors in moving the capital of New Zealand from Auckland to
Wellington that year. The South Island Party with a pro-South agenda, fielded
candidates in the 1999 General Election. Scotland. Moves towards Scottish
Independence from the United Kingdom are being led by the majority Scottish
National Party government in the Scottish Parliament, with a plebiscite
scheduled for the Autumn of 2014. Southern Cameroons/Ambazonia. Southern
Cameroons today makes up the two English-speaking regions of the Republic of
Cameroun, the North West and South West regions. The people of Southern
Cameroons' claim to self-determination arises out of their allegations that the
Republic of Cameroun forcefully annexed their territory by the 1961 take over
of the territory and the 1972 dissolution of the federation in favor of a
Unitary Republic of Cameroon. Southern Cameroons scored a victory in a legal
battle against the Republic of Cameroon when the African Commission for Human
and Peoples' Rights found that there were unresolved issues with the
constitutional structure of the Republic of Cameroon vis-a-vis Southern
Cameroons. More importantly, the African Commission found that contrary to the
claims of the Republic of Cameroon, the people of Southern Cameroons are indeed
a "people" under the African Charter and broad international law with the
inalienable right to determine their destiny. Southern Sudan. Southern Sudan
reached a peace agreement with Sudan in 2005. It contained a referendum for
self-determination in January 2011, during which an overwhelming majority
voting for secession from northern Sudan. SzÃ©kely Land. A subgroup of
Romania's ethnic Hungarian minority concentrated in the area known as SzÃ©kely
Land, the SzÃ©kelys have been striving for local autonomy and the right to
practice self-determination since the fall of communism. Tamil Eelam and Sri
Lanka. The Sri Lankan Tamils people seek self-determination due to ethnic
pogroms and discrimination by the majority Sinhala government's discrimination
in language, education, jobs, and civil liberties. The early non violent
protests developed into a violent confrontation with the state and eventual
civil war. Tamil independence advocates argue that former sovereignty of Tamils
in their north eastern homeland that was lost during colonialism should be re-
instated to meet Tamil aspirations. Taiwan. Taiwan is the focus of a self-
determination dispute in the East Asia region. The government of the People's
Republic of China claims the entirety of Taiwan as its territory. However,
Taiwanese independence advocates argue that there is no legal claim to Taiwan,
as no legally binding treaty ever transferred sovereignty to China following
World War II, an assertion with which not only the People's Republic of China
but the Republic of China currently governing Taiwan disagree. This "de facto"
government of Taiwan also has not formally withdrawn its claims to China and
several other areas. The People's Republic of China proposes that the island
become its own special administrative region of China. Tibet. From its
unification from 604-650 CE until 1724 and from 1912 to 1951, Tibet was a
sovereign nation. In 1949, when the Dalai Lama was 15 years old and thus not
yet the head of state, the Chinese government ordered a military march into
Tibet in order to force the Tibetan government to negotiate its sovereignty.
When negotiations failed, China invaded. Tibet was then forced to "peacefully
negotiate" its sovereignty, and ceded rule over Tibet to China in the Seventeen
Point Agreement in 1951. The Dalai Lama has repudiated the agreement, claiming
that it was signed under compulsion and that Chinese government forged Tibetan
government seals. The delegates who allegedly represented Tibet were either
chosen by the Chinese or were prisoners of Chinese, and were not allowed to
communicate with the official Tibetan government during negotiations. Since the
agreement, there have been widespread reports of political and religious
oppression of Tibetans by the Chinese. The Tibetan government in exile, located
in India, has continuously called for Tibet's sovereignty to be restored, or
alternatively, in recent years, for greater political autonomy for the Tibetan
region within the Chinese political system. Turkish Cypriots. Since Turkey's
invasion and continued occupation of Cyprus in 1974, following ethnic clashes
and turmoil on the island, an administration recognized by Turkey only was
declared in 1983 â€“ the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. Turkish Cypriots
and their former leader, FazÄ±l KÃ¼Ã§Ã¼k said that Turkish Cypriots had the
right of self-determination, as well as Greek Cypriots. United States. The
colonization of the North American continent and its Native American population
has been the source of legal battles since the early 19th century. Surviving
Native Americans have been resettled onto separate tracts of land
(reservations), which have been given a certain degree of autonomy within the
United States federal government. Some Chicano nationalist groups seek to
"recreate" AztlÃ¡n, the legendary homeland of the Aztecs comprising the
Southwestern United States which is home to the majority of Mexican Americans.
There are multiple active Hawaiian independence movements each with their own
distinct modality of realizing some level of political control over single or
several islands. The groups range from those seeking territorial units similar
to Indian reservations under the United States with the least amount of
independent control to the Hawaiian sovereignty movement which would have the
most amount of control, The Hawaiian Sovereignty movement aims at reviving the
Hawaiian nation under the Hawaiian constitution, which has retained its
sovereignty while under prolonged illegal occupation since 1893. Since 1972,
the U.N. Decolonization Committee has called for Puerto Rico's decolonization
and for the U.S. to recognize the island's right to self-determination and
independence. In 2007 the Decolonization Subcommittee called for the United
Nations General Assembly to review the political status of Puerto Rico, a power
reserved by the 1953 Resolution. This follows the 1967 passage of a plebiscite
act that provided for a vote on the status of Puerto Rico with three status
options: continued commonwealth, statehood, and independence. In the first
plebscite the commonwealth option won with 60.4% of the votes but U.S.
congressional committees failed to enact legislation to address the status
issue. In subsequent plebiscites in 1993 and 1998, the status quo was upheld.
Many current U.S. state, regional and city secession groups use the language of
self-determination. A 2008 Zogby International poll revealed that 22% of
Americans believe that "any state or region has the right to peaceably secede
and become an independent republic." So-called "Confederate Southern
Americans", defined as white Christian descendents of those resident in the
Confederate States of America at the onset of the Civil War (preferably having
Scots or Scots-Irish descent), are seeking a "natural right to self-
determination" by claiming "oppressed minority" status through Neo-Confederate
groups such as the League of the South. A 2012 book by Marcus Ruiz Evans
entitled California's Next Century details an overhauling of California's
statehood via a plan to embrace its unique global role and form itself as an
independent republic, uniquely poised to become the Switzerland of the 21st
century, a global nerve center of international diplomacy, technology and
finance.
