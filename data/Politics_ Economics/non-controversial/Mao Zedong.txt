Mao Zedong Mao Zedong (also transliterated as Mao Tse-tung ), commonly referred
to as Chairman Mao (December 26, 1893September 9, 1976), was a Chinese
communist revolutionary, political theorist and politician. The architect and
founding father of the People's Republic of China (PRC) from its establishment
in 1949, he governed the country as Chairman of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China until his death in 1976. Politically a Marxist-
Leninist, his theoretical contribution to the ideology along with his military
strategies and brand of policies are collectively known as Maoism. Born the son
of a wealthy farmer in Shaoshan, Hunan, Mao adopted a Chinese nationalist and
anti-imperialist outlook in early life, particularly influenced by the events
of the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 and May Fourth Movement of 1919. Coming to
adopt Marxism, he became an early member of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC),
soon rising to a senior position. In 1922, the Communists agreed to an alliance
with the larger Kuomintang, a nationalist revolutionary party, and Mao joined
up to the latter, helping them to organize a revolutionary peasant army. In
1927, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, the Kuomintang's military leader, set
about on an anti-communist purge. Mao rose to power of the Communist Party by
commanding the Long March, forming a united front with the Kuomintang during
the Second Sino-Japanese War to repel an Imperial Japanese invasion, and
leading the CPC to victory against Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang
(KMT) in the Chinese Civil War. After solidifying the reunification of China
through his Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries, Mao enacted sweeping
land reform, by using violence and terror to overthrow the feudal landlords
before seizing their large estates and dividing the land into people's
communes. Nationwide political campaigns led by Mao, such as the Great Leap
Forward and the Cultural Revolution, are often considered catastrophic
failures; and his rule is believed to have caused the deaths of 40 to 70
million people. Severe starvation during the Great Chinese Famine, widespread
suicide as a result of the Three-anti/five-anti campaigns, mass incarceration
into Laogai labor camps, and political persecution during the Anti-Rightist
Movement and struggle sessions all resulted from these programs. His policies
are further blamed for damaging the historical culture and society of China, as
relics and religious sites were destroyed in an effort to rapidly modernize the
consciousness of the nation. However, during the years when Mao was China's
"Great Helmsman", a range of positive changes also came to China. These
included promoting the status of women, improving literacy, doubling the school
population, providing universal housing, increasing health care access, and
dramatically raising life expectancy. In addition, China's population almost
doubled during the period of Mao's leadership (from around 550 to over 900
million). As a result, Mao is still officially held in high regard by many
Chinese as a great political strategist, military mastermind, and savior of the
nation. Maoists further promote his role as a theorist, statesman, poet, and
visionary, while anti-revisionists continue to defend most of his policies.
Although Mao's stated goals of combating bureaucracy, encouraging popular
participation, and stressing China's self-reliance are generally seen as
laudable‚Äîand the rapid industrialization that began during Mao's reign is
credited for laying a foundation for China's development in the late 20th
century‚Äîthe violent methods he used to pursue them have been widely rebuked
as being ruthless and self-defeating. Mao is still regarded as one of the most
important figures in modern world history, and was named one of the people of
the 20th century by "Time" magazine. Early life. Childhood: 1893‚Äì1911. Mao
was born on December 26, 1893 in a rural village in Shaoshan, Hunan Province.
His father, Mao Shun-sheng (1870‚Äì1920), had been born into a poverty-stricken
peasant family, and had gained two years worth of education before joining the
army. Eventually returning to agriculture, he earned a living as both a
moneylender and a grain merchant, buying up local grain and then selling it on
in the city for a higher price, allowing him to become one of the wealthiest
farmers in Shaoshan, with 20 acres of land. Mao Zedong would describe his
father as a stern disciplinarian, who would often punish his son and other
children ‚Äì two boys, Tse-min (b.1896) and Tse-tan (b.1905), and an adopted
girl ‚Äì for any perceived wrongdoings, sometimes by beating them. His wife,
Wen Ch'i-mei, was illiterate but a devout Buddhist who tried to temper her
husband's strict attitude towards both his children and other locals. Following
his mother's example, Mao also became a practising Buddhist from an early age,
venerating a bronze statue of the Buddha which was in their home, but abandoned
this faith in his mid-teenage years. His father was largely irreligious,
although after surviving an encounter with a tiger, began to give offerings to
the gods in thanks. Aged 8, Mao was sent to the local Shaoshan Primary School
by his father, who recognised the financial value of a basic education. Here,
Mao was taught the value systems of Confucianism, one of the dominant moral
ideologies in China, but he would later admit that he did not enjoy reading the
classical Chinese texts which preached Confucian morals, instead favouring
popular novels such as "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" and "Water Margin".
Reacting against his Confucian upbringing, aged 11 Mao ran away from home,
heading for what he believed was a nearby town, but eventually his father found
him and brought him home. Aged 13, Mao finished primary education, and his
father had him married to Luo Yixiu (1889‚Äì1910), a woman four years his
senior, in order to unite their two land-owning families. They never lived
together and Mao refused to recognise her as his wife, becoming a fierce critic
of arranged marriage. He began work on his father's farm, but continued to read
voraciously in his spare time. One of the most influential texts that he read
was Cheng Kuan-ying's "Sheng-shih Wei-yen" ("Words of Warning to an Affluent
Age"), a political tract that lamented the deterioration of Chinese power in
East Asia, arguing for technological, economic and political reform, modelling
China on the representative democracies of the western world. Mao would later
claim that he first developed a "political consciousness" from that booklet.
Another influential book which he read at the time was a translation of "Great
Heroes of the World", becoming inspired by the American revolutionary George
Washington and French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, whose military prowess and
nationalistic fervour greatly impressed him. His political views of the time
were also shaped by popular protests that had erupted following a famine in
Changsha, the capital of Hunan; Mao supported the protester's demands, but the
armed forces soon suppressed the dissenters and executed their leaders. The
famine soon spread throughout Hunan, reaching Shaoshan; here, starving peasants
seized some of his father's grain, and while Mao disapproved of their actions
as morally wrong, he also claimed a great deal of sympathy for their situation.
Aged 16, Mao moved on to study at a higher primary school in nearby Tungshan.
Here, he was taught alongside students of a higher social standing, and was
often bullied for his scruffy appearance and peasant background; being much
older than the other pupils, he failed to fit in. The Xinhai Revolution:
1911‚Äì1912. In 1911, Mao convinced his father to allow him to attend middle
school in the city of Changsha. At the time, the city was "a revolutionary
hotbed", with widespread animosity towards the governing Emperor Puyi
(1906‚Äì1967) and the concept of absolute monarchy itself. While some advocated
a reformist transition to a constitutional monarchy, most revolutionaries
advocated republicanism, hoping to overthrow the Emperor and replace him with a
democratically elected president. The primary figurehead behind this republican
movement was Dr. Sun Yat-Sen (1867‚Äì1925), the leader of a secret society
known as the "Tongmenghui" who had spent time in the United States and
converted to Christianity. At Changsha, Mao first read a copy of Sun's
newspaper, "The People's Strength" ("Min-lin-pao"), and was greatly influenced
by it. Inspired by Sun's example, Mao penned his first political essay, which
he stuck to the school wall; later admitting that it was "somewhat muddled", it
involved a plan for overthrowing the monarchy and replacing it with a republic
governed by the presidency of Sun, but with concessions made to the moderates
by having Kang Youwei as premier and Liang Qichao as minister of foreign
affairs. As a symbol of rebellion against the Manchu monarch, he and a friend
cut off their queue pigtails ‚Äì a sign of subservience to the emperor ‚Äì
before forcibly cutting off those of some of their classmates too. Later that
year, the Chinese armed forces, inspired by the republican ideas of Sun, rose
up in insurrection against the Emperor across southern China, sparking the
Xinhai Revolution. The city of Changsha initially remained under the control of
the monarch, with the governor proclaiming martial law on its streets to quell
any popular protests. Soon however, the infantry brigade guarding the city
proclaimed their support for the revolution, and the governor was forced to
flee, leaving the city in republican hands. Eager to support the revolutionary
cause, Mao joined the rebel army as a private soldier, but was not involved in
the fighting. The northern provinces had remained loyal to the Emperor, and
hoping to avoid a civil war, Sun Yat-Sen ‚Äì already proclaimed "provisional
president" by his supporters ‚Äì had come to a compromise with the Emperor's
key ally Yuan Shikai (1859‚Äì1916); the monarchy would be abolished, and Late
Imperial China would be converted into a new Republic of China, but it would be
the royalist Yuan and not the revolutionary Sun who would become its first
President. The Xinhai Revolution over, Mao resigned from the army in 1912,
after six months of being a soldier. It had been during this period that Mao
had first learned of the imported western concept of socialism from a newspaper
article, and intrigued, he read several pamphlets by Jiang Kanghu
(1883‚Äì1954), a student who had founded the Chinese Socialist Party in
November 1911. Nevertheless, while remaining convinced of the need of a
republican government, he was not yet convinced by the need for a socialist
economy. Fourth Normal School of Changsha: 1912‚Äì1917. Returning his attention
to education, Mao enrolled and dropped out of a series of schools in quick
succession; a police academy, a soap-production school, a law school and an
economics school, the latter being the only course which his father approved
of. However, the lectures were given in the English language, which Mao could
not understand, and so he soon abandoned this and began attendance at the
government-run Changsha Middle School; he soon dropped out of this too, finding
its courses too rooted in old Confucian ideas and traditions. Deciding to
undertake his studies independently, he spent much time in the newly opened
public library at Changsha, reading the core works of classical liberalism such
as Adam Smith's "The Wealth of Nations" and Montesquieu's "The Spirit of the
Laws", as well as the works of western scientists and philosophers like Charles
Darwin, J.S. Mill, Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Herbert Spencer. Seeing no use in
his son's purely intellectual pursuits, Mao's father cut off his allowance,
forcing Mao to move into a hostel for the destitute. Deciding that he would
like to become a professional teacher, Mao enrolled at a teacher training
college, the Fourth Normal School of Changsha, which had high standards yet low
fees and cheap accommodation. Several months later, it amalgamated with the
prestigious First Normal School of Changsha, widely seen as the best school in
Hunan province; Mao biographer Stuart Schram would later note that the
environment of the school provided "an ideal training ground for his
apprenticeship as a political worker." He was heavily influenced by several
teachers at the school, including the professor of ethics, Yang Changji, who
urged Mao and his other students to read a radical newspaper, "New Youth"
("Hsien Ch'ing-nien"), which was the creation of his friend Chen Duxiu
(1879‚Äì1942), Dean of the Faculty of Letters at Peking University. Although a
Chinese nationalist, Chen argued that in order to progress, China must look to
the west, adopting "Mr. Democracy and Mr. Science" in order to cleanse itself
of superstition and autocracy. Mao would publish his first article, "A Study of
Physical Culture", in "New Youth" in April 1917, in which he instructed all
Chinese people to increase their physical strength in order to serve the
revolutionary cause. He also joined another revolutionary organisation, The
Society for the Study of Wang Fuzhi ("Chuan-shan Hs√ºeh-she") which had been
founded by a number of Changsha literati who wished to emulate Wang Fuzhi
(1619‚Äì1692), a philosopher who had become a symbol of Han resistance to
Manchu invasion. In his first year at the school, Mao befriended an older
student, Siao Yu, and together they went on a walking holiday through the
countryside, along the way begging in order to obtain food. Mao also remained
active in school politics, in 1915 becoming elected to the position of
secretary of the Students Society. He used his position to forge an Association
for Student Self-Government, leading protests against various rules then
implemented in the school. In spring 1917, he was also elected to command the
students' volunteer army, set up to defend the school from potential attack
after two warlords began fighting one another in Hunan. With two close friends,
Mao began undertaking feats of physical endurance ‚Äì such as sleeping outdoors
and living on a frugal diet ‚Äì and they began describing themselves as the
"Three Heroes" after the rebels that featured in Chinese literature. They
attracted other young people with radical political ideas around them, forming
a society known as the New People's Study Society who debated Chen Duxiu's
ideas. Having passed his exams, Mao graduated from the school in the spring of
1918. Early revolutionary activity. Peking and Marxism: 1917‚Äì1919. Leaving
Changsha, Mao moved to the capital city of Peking, where his school mentor Yang
Changji had recently migrated to take up a job at Peking University. Yang was
favourable towards Mao, writing in his journal that "it is truly difficult to
imagine someone so intelligent and handsome him." Yang secured Mao employment
at the university library, where he became assistant to the librarian Li Dazhao
(1888‚Äì1927), an early Chinese communist. Li authored a series of articles in
"New Youth" on the subject of the October Revolution which had just occurred in
Russia, during which the communist Bolshevik Party under the leadership of
Vladimir Lenin (1870‚Äì1924) had seized power. Lenin was an advocate of the
socio-political theory of Marxism, first developed by the German sociologists
Karl Marx (1818‚Äì1883) and Friedrich Engels (1820‚Äì1895) in the mid-19th
century, and Li's articles helped bring an understanding of Marxism to the
Chinese revolutionary movement, even though he failed to fully understand it
himself. Mao would claim that although he did not accept Marxism at first, he
had come under the influence of anarchism and was becoming "more and more
radical" as the months went on. Beginning to read and discuss the work of Marx
with Li and other like-minded radicals at a Marxist Study Group, he eventually
"developed rapidly toward Marxism" under Li's tutelage during the winter of
1918‚Äì19, looking for ways to combine it with ancient Chinese philosophies
that would be applicable to modern China. Eventually coming to adopt an
orthodox Marxist-Leninist position by accepting not only Marx's ideas but also
those of Lenin, he came to view Chinese nationalism as a powerful tool in the
national liberation struggle against western and Japanese dominance, but unlike
orthodox Marxist-Leninists also viewed nationalism as something intrinsically
valuable in itself. Paid a low wage, Mao was forced to live in a cramped room
near to the university with seven other Hunanese students, but believed that
the beauty of Peking offered "vivid and living compensation." A number of his
friends and future colleagues took advantage of the "Mouvement Travail-√âtudes"
to study in France, but Mao, perhaps because of a lack of ability to learn
languages and the requirement to learn French, turned down the opportunity.
Remaining at the university, he tried to strike up conversations with academics
working there, but most snubbed him because of his rural Hunanese accent and
lowly position as librarian's assistant. Nonetheless, by joining the
university's Philosophy and Journalism Societies, he was able to attend various
lectures and seminars by the likes of Chen Duxiu, Hu Shi, and Qian Xuantong,
but various lecturers still treated him with contempt and refused to answer his
questions. Mao's time in Peking came to an end in the spring of 1919, when he
traveled to Shanghai with friends departing from the port for France. On the
way visiting a number of historic sites such as Qufu, the burial place of
Confucius, he traveled much of the journey on foot, at one point losing his
shoes. Student rebellions: 1919‚Äì1920. At the time, China had fallen victim to
the expansionist policies of the Empire of Japan, who had conquered large areas
of Chinese-controlled territory, namely Taiwan, Korea and South Manchuria. The
Japanese claim to these lands had been supported by the western powers of
France, the U.K. and the U.S. at the Treaty of Versailles, who also agreed that
Japan could take control of all the territories in China that had formerly been
under the dominion of the defeated German Empire. The Chinese Beiyang
Government, under the control of the warlord Duan Qirui (1865‚Äì1936), had
accepted Japanese dominance, agreeing to their Twenty-One Demands, despite
popular opposition among the Chinese populace. In May 1919, the May Fourth
Movement had erupted in Peking, with Chinese patriots rallying against the
Japanese occupation and Duan's collaborative government. Chinese troops were
sent in to crush the protests, but the mass unrest spread throughout much of
China. In Changsha, Mao took advantage of the unrest to help organize protests
against the Governor of Hunan Province, Zhang Jinghui, a supporter of Duan's.
Mao was a founding member of the United Student Association and in July 1919
began production of a weekly radical magazine, "Hsiang River Review" ("Hsiang-
chiang P'ing-lun"). Using vernacular language that would be understandable to
the majority of China's populace, he put forward his socialist political views,
calling for revolution against the government; in one notable article, he
proclaimed the need for a "Great Union of the Popular Masses", but failed to
put forward an expressly Marxist analysis of how that revolution should
proceed. Governor Zhang soon ordered the United Student Association and its
associated weekly shut down, but Mao continued publishing his views after
assuming editorship of the student magazine "New Hunan" ("Hsin Hunan"). When
this in turn was also shut down by Zhang's provincial administration, he then
began publishing his articles in the popular local newspaper "Ta Kung Po".
Several of these articles advocated his staunchly feminist views, calling for
the liberation of women in Chinese society; alongside his early experiences
with forced arranged marriage, this was possibly influenced by the recent death
of his mother and his increasing romantic involvement with Yang Kaihui
(1901‚Äì1930), the daughter of Mao's recently deceased mentor Yang Changji. In
November 1919, Mao took a leading role in the re-organization of the banned
United Student Association, and in December helped to organize a student strike
in Changsha's schools, designed to cripple Zhang's control. The strike did
secure some concessions, but Mao and other student leaders felt that they were
now under threat from the furious Zhang, and were sent as representatives to
China's provincial centers; thus, Mao once again traveled to Peking. In Peking,
Mao found that he had achieved a level of fame among the revolutionary movement
for his fervent article writing, and he set about soliciting support in
overthrowing Zhang's rule in Hunan. It was in the city that he also came across
newly translated Marxist literature, further committing him to the
revolutionary socialist cause: these included Thomas Kirkup's " A History of
Socialism", Karl Kautsky's "Karl Marx's √ñkonomische Lehren" and most
importantly, Marx and Engels' political pamphlet, "The Communist Manifesto".
From Peking, Mao moved along to Shanghai, working as a laundryman and meeting
with Chen Duxiu, who had been recently freed from prison; together, they
discussed Marxism, which Chen was also beginning to accept. Mao later noted
that Chen's adoption of Marxism "deeply impressed me at what was probably a
critical period in my life." In Shanghai, Mao also met with one of his old
teachers, Yi Peiji, a revolutionary and member of the Kuomintang, or Chinese
Nationalist Party, which at the time was gaining increasing support and
influence across China. Yi Peiji introduced Mao to General Tan Yankai, a senior
Kuomintang member who held the loyalty of the troops stationed along the border
between Hunan and Kwantung. Tan was plotting to overthrow Governor Zhang and
his pro-Japanese Hunanese administration, and Mao aided him by organizing the
students of Changsha. In June 1920, Tan led his troops into Changsha, while
Zhang fled. In the subsequent reorganization of the provincial administration,
Mao was appointed as the headmaster of the junior section of the First Normal
School. Now receiving a large income, he was able to marry Yang Kaihui in the
winter of 1920. Founding the Communist Party of China: 1921‚Äì1922. The
Communist Party of China was founded by Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao in the French
concession of Shanghai in 1921 as a study society and an informal network. Mao
soon set up his own branch in Changsha, also establishing a branch of the
Socialist Youth Corps. He furthermore opened a bookstore under the control of
his new Cultural Book Society, whose purpose was to propagate revolutionary
literature throughout Hunan. Helping to organise workers' strikes in the winter
of 1920‚Äì1921, Mao was also involved in the movement advocating autonomy for
the province, a viewpoint shared by figures from a variety of different
political persuasions. Mao's hope was that the creation of a Hunanese
constitution would increase civil liberties in the province and thereby make
his revolutionary activity easier; although it proved successful, in later
life, he would subsequently deny any involvement in the movement. By 1921,
small groups of Marxists existed in six Chinese cities: Shanghai, Peking,
Changsha, Wuhan, Canton and Tsinan, with a further group having been founded by
Chinese students in Paris. It was decided that they should send delegates for a
central meeting, which began in Shanghai on July 23, 1921. The first session of
the National Congress of the Communist Party of China was attended by 13
delegates, Mao included, and initially met in a girls' school that had been
closed for the summer. After the authorities learned of this meeting and sent a
police spy to report on their subversive activities, the delegates instead
moved their activities to a boat on South Lake near to Chiahsing, where they
escaped detection by claiming to be on a holiday excursion. Although delegates
from the Soviet Union and Comintern had attended, the first congress ignored
Lenin's advice by refusing to accept a temporary alliance between the
communists and the "bourgeois democrats" who also advocated national
revolution; instead they stuck to the orthodox Marxist belief that only the
urban proletariat could lead a socialist revolution. Now the party secretary
for Hunan, Mao stationed himself in Changsha, from where he went on a
recruitment drive to gain support for the Communist Party. In August 1921, Mao
founded the Self-Study University, through which readers could gain access to
Marxist and other revolutionary literature, and which was housed in the
premises of the Society for the Study of Wang Fuzhi ("Chuan-shan Hs√ºeh-she").
He also took part in the mass education movement to fight illiteracy, founded
in 1921 by members of the Chinese Young Men's Christian Association with U.S.
backing. Opening a Changsha branch, Mao replaced the usual textbooks with
revolutionary tracts in order to spread Marxist ideas among the illiterate
peasantry. He also continued with his work in organizing the labour movement to
strike in an attempt to damage the administration of Hunanese Governor Zhao
Hengti, particularly after the latter executed two anarchist activists. In July
1922, the Second Congress of the Communist Party took place in Shanghai; while
Mao lost the address and was unable to attend, the delegates decided to finally
adopt the Leninist advice by agreeing to an alliance with the "bourgeois
democrats" of the Kuomintang for the good of the "national revolution" to unite
China and free it of foreign imperialist influence. As a result, members of the
Communist Party began to join the Kuomintang, hoping to influence its politics
in a leftward direction. Mao agreed with this decision, vocally arguing for an
anti-imperialist alliance which constituted all of China's socio-economic
classes, and not merely the urban proletariat. In his writings, he lambasted
the governments of Japan, Great Britain and the United States, describing the
latter as "the most murderous of hangmen." Collaboration with the Kuomintang:
1922‚Äì1927. At the Third Congress of the Communist Party, held in Shanghai in
June 1923, the delegates reaffirmed their commitment to working with the
Kuomintang to overthrow the Beiyang Government and the imperialist powers then
occupying parts of China. A staunch supporter of this position, at the Congress
Mao was elected to the Communist Party Committee, taking up residence in the
city. He became involved with the Kuomintang, attending their First Congress,
held in Canton during January and February 1924. Soon elected an alternate
member of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee, in February 1924 he put
forward four resolutions that argued that power in the party was too
centralized among a few cadres in Canton, and that power should instead he
decentralized to urban and rural bureaus. His enthusiastic support for the
nationalist party earned him the suspicion of some of the communists.
Biographer Stuart Schram would later comment that during the period between
1925 and 1927, Mao was closer to the Kuomintang than he was to the Communist
Party, something he attributed to Mao's belief that the good of China was more
important than the cause of socialism. In late 1924, Mao returned to his home
village of Shaoshan for the first time in 15 years to recuperate from an
illness. Here, he discovered that the peasantry were becoming increasingly
restless as a result of the social and political upheaval of the past decade,
with some seizing land from wealthy landowners and founding their own communes.
These actions convinced him of the revolutionary potential of the peasants, an
idea advocated by the Kuomintang but not the Communist Party. As a result, he
was subsequently appointed to the leadership of the Kuomintang's Peasant
Movement Training Institute, also becoming the Director of the Party's
Propaganda Department. In doing so, he became the editor of the Kuomintang's
newsletter, the "Political Weekly" ("Zhengzhi zhoubao"). Through the Peasant
Movement Training Institute, Mao took an active role in organizing the
revolutionary Hunanese peasants and preparing them for militant activity,
taking them through military training exercises and getting them to study
various left-wing texts. In the winter of 1925, Mao fled to Canton after his
revolutionary activities attracted the attention of Zhao's regional
authorities. At the time, the country was once more facing violent upheaval; on
May 30, 1925, police from the Shanghai International Settlement followed the
orders of a British policeman and opened fire on a group of protesters, killing
10 and wounding 50. The Chinese Chamber of Commerce agreed on a strike in
solidarity with the protesters, which in turn led to increasingly repressive
measures by the authorities. Mao and the communists constituted the left wing
of the Kuomintang, and were caught in power struggles with the party's right
wing, some of whom urged a purge of the leftists. When party leader Sun Yat-Sen
died in May 1925, he was succeeded by a rightist, Chiang Kai-shek
(1887‚Äì1977), who opposed Mao and other high ranking leftists, and who
initiated moves to marginalize the position of the communists in the party. Mao
nevertheless was supportive of Chiang when he decided to overthrow the Beiyang
Government warlords and their foreign imperialist allies, leading his National
Revolutionary Army on the Northern Expedition in order to do so. In the wake of
the Northern Expedition, peasants continued to rise up, appropriating the land
of the wealthy land-owners, whom were in many cases killed. Such peasant
uprisings had angered many of the senior figures and generals in the
Kuomintang, who were themselves wealthy land-owners, emphasising the class and
ideological divide that was becoming increasingly apparent in the revolutionary
movement. Mao soon turned his attention to the issue of land appropriation and
redistribution. In March 1927, he appeared at the Third Plenum of the
Kuomintang Central Executive Committee in Wuhan, which sought to reorganize the
party and strip General Chiang of the increasing amount of power that he had
attained, instead appointing Wang Jingwei to the leadership. Mao played an
active role in the discussions regarding the peasant issue at the Third Plenum,
defending a set of "Regulations for the Repression of Local Bullies and Bad
Gentry", which advocated the death penalty or life imprisonment for anyone
found guilty of counter-revolutionary activity. Mao argued that in a
revolutionary situation, "peaceful methods cannot suffice to overthrow the
local bullies and bad gentry." In April 1927, Mao was appointed as one of the
five-member Central Land Committee of the Kuomintang, and he continued to urge
peasants to refuse to pay rents to the landlords. Mao proceeded to lead another
group of five to put together a "Draft Resolution on the Land Question", which
called for the confiscation of land belonging to "local bullies and bad gentry,
corrupt officials, militarists and all counter-revolutionary elements in the
villages." He proceeded to carry out a "Land Survey" in which he stated that
anyone owning over 30 "mou" (four and a half acres), constituting 13% of the
population, were uniformly counter-revolutionary. He nevertheless accepted that
there was great variation in revolutionary enthusiasm across the country, and
that a flexible policy of land redistrubution was therefore necessary. He
presented his conclusions at the Enlarged Land Committee meeting on 22 April,
but many of those assembled expressed reservations, some believing that it went
too far, and others expressing the opinion that it did not go far enough.
Ultimately, Mao's suggestions were only partially implemented. Civil War. The
Nanchang and Autumn Harvest Uprisings: 1927. Fresh from the success of the
Northern Expedition to overthrow the warlords, General Chiang Kai-shek turned
on the communists, whom by now numbered in the tens of thousands across China.
He ignored the orders sent to him by the Kuomintang civilian government based
in Wuhan, instead marching on Shanghai, a city controlled by communist
militias. Although the communists welcomed Chiang's arrival, believing him to
be their ally, he turned on them, massacring 5000 with the aid of the Green
Gang. Allies of Chiang across China began to do the same; in Peking, 19 leading
communists were killed by General Zhang Zuolin, while in Changsha, General Ho
Chien's forces turned on the local communists, machine gunning several hundred
peasant militiamen. That May, tens of thousands of communists and radical
peasants, workers and students were killed by nationalist forces, with the
Communist Party losing approximately 15,000 of its 25,000 members. Chiang's
army soon marched on Wuhan, but was prevented from taking the city by troops
under the control of the communist General Yeh T'ing. In the face of the
marauding generals, the Communist Party continued its support of the Kuomintang
civilian government in Wuhan, a position Mao initially publicly supported. At
the Fifth Congress of the Communist Party, the delegates ultimately decided to
maintain this position, disgusting Mao, who wanted to stake all hope on the
peasant militia. The question was rendered moot when the Wuhan government
decided to expell all Communists from the Kuomintang on 15 July. The Communists
subsequently agreed to raise their own army to battle Chiang, founding the
Workers' and Peasants' Red Army of China, better known as the "Red Army". One
group, under the leadership of General Zhu De, was ordered to take the city of
Nanchang on 1 August 1927 in what became known as the Nanchang Uprising;
initially successful, they were forced into retreat after five days, marching
south to Swatow, and from there being driven into the wilderness of Fujian.
Meanwhile, having been appointed as commander-in-chief of the Red Army, Mao had
led four regiments to undertake the Autumn Harvest Uprising in Changsha, in the
hope of sparking peasant uprisings across Hunan. On the eve of the attack, Mao
composed a poem ‚Äì the earliest of his to survive ‚Äì that was entitled simply
"Changsha". His plan was to attack the nationalist-held city from three
directions on 9 September, but they soon ran into trouble when his Fourth
Regiment deserted to join the Kuomintang cause, attacking the Third Regiment.
Despite this set back, Mao's army managed to make it to Changsha, but found the
city to be heavily defended, and many of his men were gunned down my machine
gun fire. By the 15 September, he accepted his defeat, and with his thousand
surviving men marched east to the Jinggang Mountains of Jiangxi. Base in
Chingkangshan: 1927‚Äì1930. In the aftermath of the failed Autumn Harvest
Uprising, the Communist Party Central Committee, then hiding in Shanghai,
decided to punish Mao for "military opportunism", for focusing on rural rather
than urban revolutionary activities, and for being too moderate in punishing
"bad gentry". As such, they removed Mao both from their rank and from the Hunan
Provincial Committee. They nevertheless chose to adopt three policies that he
had long championed: the immediate formation of soviets, the confiscation of
all land without exemption, and the complete rejection of the Kuomintang and
their flag. Mao's response to their dissaproval was simply to ignore them.
Setting up base in Chingkangshan, an area of the Jinggang Mountains, Mao united
five villages as a self-governing state with its own independent government,
and initiated measures to further land reform by supporting the confiscation of
land from rich landlords, who were "re-educated" and in some cases executed, a
punishment Mao supported. He nevertheless ensured that no massacres took place
under the region he controlled, pursuing a more moderate approach than that
called for by the Central Committee. Mao decided to form a union with two
groups of armed bandits, led by Y√ºan Wen-ts'ai and Wang Tso, whom he believed
could be converted to the communist cause. In doing so, he assembled together a
force of around 1800 troops. He successfuly welcomed others to come and join
his army, proclaiming that "Even the lame, the deaf, and the blind could all
come in useful for the revolutionary struggle." He laid down simple rules for
his soldiers to follow: prompt obediance to orders, all confiscations from
landlords and rich peasants were to be turned over to the government, and
nothing was to be confiscated from the poor peasants. In doing so, he was able
to mold his men into a disciplined, efficient fighting force. In the spring of
1928, the Central Committee ordered Mao to march his troops to southern Hunan,
in the hope of sparking the Hunanese peasants in revolution. Mao was sceptical,
but complied. When they reached Hunan, they were attacked by the Kuomintang and
suffered heavy losses, being forced to flee. In the meantime, Kuomintang troops
had also invaded Chingkangshan, leaving them without a base. Wandering the
countryside, Mao's forces came across another communist army under the
leadership of General Zhu De and Lin Biao, and it was decided that they would
combine forces and attempt to retake Chingkangshan. Although initially
successful, the Kuomintang forces counter-attacked, pushing the communists
back; over the next few weeks, they involved themselves in guerilla combat
techniques against the enemy. Central Committee once again ordered Mao to march
to south Hunan, but this time he refused, deciding to stay at his base. In
contrast, Zhu had complied, leading his armies to fight. The Kuomintang took
the opportunity to attack Mao's base, and although his troops were able to fend
them off for 25 days, he realized that they would soon fail, and so Mao left
the camp at night. He proceeded to reunite with Zhu's army, who had been
decimated in Hunan, and together they returned to Chingkangshan and retook the
base once more. They were joined by a Kuomintang regiment that had defected,
but the mountainous area was unable to crop enough crops to feed everyone,
leading to food shortages throughout the cold winter. Soviet Republic of China:
1931‚Äì1934. From 1931 to 1934, Mao helped establish the Soviet Republic of
China and was elected Chairman of this small republic in the mountainous areas
in Jiangxi. Here, Mao was married to He Zizhen. His previous wife, Yang Kaihui,
had been arrested and executed in 1930, just three years after their departure.
In Jiangxi, Mao's authoritative domination, especially that of the military
force, was challenged by the Jiangxi branch of the CPC and military officers.
Mao's opponents, among whom the most prominent was Li Wenlin, the founder of
the CPC's branch and Red Army in Jiangxi, were against Mao's land policies and
proposals to reform the local party branch and army leadership. Mao reacted
first by accusing the opponents of opportunism and kulakism and then set off a
series of systematic suppressions of them. It is reported that horrible methods
of torture were employed under Mao's direction, and given names such as
'sitting in a sedan chair', 'airplane ride', 'toad-drinking water', and 'monkey
pulling reins.' The wives of several suspects that defied him had their breasts
cut open and their genitals burned. It estimated that tens of thousands of
suspected enemies, perhaps as many as 186,000, were killed during this purge.
Critics accuse Mao's authority in Jiangxi of being secured and reassured
through the revolutionary terrorism, or red terrorism. Mao, with the help of
Zhu De, built a modest but effective army, undertook experiments in rural
reform and government, and provided refuge for Communists fleeing the KMT
purges in the cities. Mao's methods are normally referred to as guerrilla
warfare; but he himself made a distinction between guerrilla warfare ("youji
zhan") and mobile warfare ("yundong zhan"). Mao's doctrines of guerrilla
warfare and mobile warfare were based upon the fact of the poor armament and
military training of the Red Army which consisted mainly of impoverished
peasants, who, however, were fired by revolutionary passions and the aspiration
for a communist utopia. Around 1930, there had been more than ten regions,
usually entitled "soviet areas", under control of the CPC. The relative
prosperity of "soviet areas" startled and worried Chiang Kai-shek, chairman of
the Kuomintang government, who waged five waves of besieging campaigns against
the "central soviet area." More than one million Kuomintang soldiers were
involved in these five campaigns, four of which were defeated by the Red Army
led by Mao. By June 1932 (the height of its power), the Red Army had no less
than 45,000 soldiers, with a further 200,000 local militia acting as a
subsidiary force. Under increasing pressure from the KMT Encirclement
Campaigns, there was a struggle for power within the Communist leadership. Mao
was removed from his important positions and replaced by individuals (including
Zhou Enlai) who appeared loyal to the orthodox line advocated by Moscow and
represented within the CPC by a group known as the 28 Bolsheviks. Chiang, who
had earlier assumed nominal control of China due in part to the Northern
Expedition, was determined to eliminate the Communists. By October 1934, he had
them surrounded, prompting them to engage in the "Long March", a retreat from
Jiangxi in the southeast to Shaanxi in the north west of China. It was during
this , year-long journey that Mao emerged as the top Communist leader, aided by
the Zunyi Conference and the defection of Zhou Enlai to Mao's side. At this
Conference, Mao entered the Standing Committee of the Politburo of the
Communist Party of China. In 1936 Manchurian warlord and Chiang's former ally
Zhang Xueliang decided to conspire with the CPC and kidnapped Chiang Kai-shek
in Xi'an to force an end to the conflict between KMT and CPC. To secure the
release of Chiang, the KMT was forced to agree to a temporary end to the
Chinese Civil War and the forming of a United Front between the CPC and KMT
against Japan. The alliance took place with salutary effects for the
beleaguered CPC after relentless attacks by Chiang's forces. CPC agreed to form
the New Fourth Army and the 8th Route Army which were nominally under the
command of the National Revolutionary Army. During the Sino-Japanese War, Mao
advocated a strategy of avoiding open confrontations with the Japanese army and
concentrating on guerrilla warfare from his base in Yan'an, while leaving the
KMT to take on the brunt of the fighting and suffer tremendous casualties.
Instead Mao directed the CPC forces to concentrate on absorbing, and
eliminating if necessary, Chinese militia behind enemy lines. This led to
intensified conflicts between KMT and CPC forces, and the fragile alliance
broke down after the New Fourth Army incident in January 1941. Mao further
consolidated power over the Communist Party in 1942 by launching the Shu Fan
movement, or "Rectification" campaign against rival CPC members such as Wang
Ming, Wang Shiwei, and Ding Ling. Also while in Yan'an, Mao divorced He Zizhen
and married the actress Lan Ping, who would become known as Jiang Qing. Mao
also greatly expanded CPC's sphere of influence in areas outside of Japanese
control, mainly through rural mass organizations, administrative, land and tax
reform measures favouring poor peasants; while the Nationalists attempted to
neutralize the spread of Communist influence by military blockade of areas
controlled by CPC and fighting the Japanese at the same time. After the end of
World War II, the U.S. continued their military assistance to Chiang Kai-shek
and his KMT government forces against the People's Liberation Army (PLA) led by
Mao Zedong in the civil war for control of China. Likewise, the Soviet Union
gave quasi-covert support to Mao by their occupation of north east China, which
allowed the PLA to move in en masse and took large supplies of arms left by the
Japanese's Kwantung Army. In 1948, under direct orders from Mao, the People's
Liberation Army starved out the Kuomintang forces occupying the city of
Changchun. At least 160,000 civilians are believed to have perished during the
siege, which lasted from June until October. PLA lieutenant colonel Zhang
Zhenglu, who documented the siege in his book "White Snow, Red Blood", compared
it to Hiroshima: ""The casualties were about the same. Hiroshima took nine
seconds; Changchun took five months."" On January 21, 1949, Kuomintang forces
suffered great losses in battles against Mao's forces. In the early morning of
December 10, 1949, PLA troops laid siege to Chengdu, the last KMT-held city in
mainland China, and Chiang Kai-shek evacuated from the mainland to Taiwan.
Leadership of China. The People's Republic of China was established on October
1, 1949. It was the culmination of over two decades of civil and international
wars. From 1943 to 1976, Mao was the Chairman of the Communist Party of China.
During this period, Mao was called Chairman Mao (, "M√°o Zh«îx√≠") or the Great
Leader Chairman Mao (, "Wƒõid√  L«êngxi√π M√°o Zh«îx√≠"). Mao famously
announced: "The Chinese people have stood up." Mao took up residence in
Zhongnanhai, a compound next to the Forbidden City in Beijing, and there he
ordered the construction of an indoor swimming pool and other buildings. Mao
often did his work either in bed or by the side of the pool, preferring not to
wear formal clothes unless absolutely necessary, according to Dr. Li Zhisui,
his personal physician. (Li's book, "The Private Life of Chairman Mao", is
regarded as controversial, especially by those sympathetic to Mao.) In October
1950, Mao made the decision to send the People's Volunteer Army into Korea and
fight against the United Nations forces led by the U.S. Historical records
showed that Mao directed the PVA campaigns in the Korean War to the minute
details. Along with land reform, during which significant numbers of landlords
and well-to-do peasants were beaten to death at mass meetings organized by the
Communist Party as land was taken from them and given to poorer peasants, there
was also the Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries, which involved public
executions targeting mainly former Kuomintang officials, businessmen accused of
"disturbing" the market, former employees of Western companies and
intellectuals whose loyalty was suspect. The U.S. State department in 1976
estimated that there may have been a million killed in the land reform, and
800,000 killed in the counterrevolutionary campaign. Mao himself claimed that a
total of 700,000 people were executed during the years 1949‚Äì53. However,
because there was a policy to select "at least one landlord, and usually
several, in virtually every village for public execution", the number of deaths
range between 2 million and 5 million. In addition, at least 1.5 million
people, perhaps as many as 4 to 6 million, were sent to "reform through labour"
camps where many perished. Mao played a personal role in organizing the mass
repressions and established a system of execution quotas, which were often
exceeded. He defended these killings as necessary for the securing of power.
Starting in 1951, Mao initiated two successive movements in an effort to rid
urban areas of corruption by targeting wealthy capitalists and political
opponents, known as the three-anti/five-anti campaigns. A climate of raw terror
developed as workers denounced their bosses, spouses turned on their spouses,
and children informed on their parents; the victims often were humiliated at
struggle sessions, a method designed to intimidate and terrify people to the
maximum. Mao insisted that minor offenders be criticized and reformed or sent
to labor camps, "while the worst among them should be shot." These campaigns
took several hundred thousand additional lives, the vast majority via suicide.
In Shanghai, suicide by jumping from tall buildings became so commonplace that
residents avoided walking on the pavement near skyscrapers for fear that
suicides might land on them. Some biographers have pointed out that driving
those perceived as enemies to suicide was a common tactic during the Mao-era.
For example, in his biography of Mao, Philip Short notes that in the Yan'an
Rectification Movement, Mao gave explicit instructions that "no cadre is to be
killed," but in practice allowed security chief Kang Sheng to drive opponents
to suicide and that "this pattern was repeated throughout his leadership of the
People's Republic." Following the consolidation of power, Mao launched the
First Five-Year Plan (1953‚Äì58). The plan aimed to end Chinese dependence upon
agriculture in order to become a world power. With the Soviet Union's
assistance, new industrial plants were built and agricultural production
eventually fell to a point where industry was beginning to produce enough
capital that China no longer needed the USSR's support. The success of the
First-Five Year Plan was to encourage Mao to instigate the Second Five-Year
Plan, the Great Leap Forward, in 1958. Mao also launched a phase of rapid
collectivization. The CPC introduced price controls as well as a Chinese
character simplification aimed at increasing literacy. Large-scale
industrialization projects were also undertaken. Programs pursued during this
time include the Hundred Flowers Campaign, in which Mao indicated his supposed
willingness to consider different opinions about how China should be governed.
Given the freedom to express themselves, liberal and intellectual Chinese began
opposing the Communist Party and questioning its leadership. This was initially
tolerated and encouraged. After a few months, Mao's government reversed its
policy and persecuted those, totalling perhaps 500,000, who criticized, as well
as those who were merely alleged to have criticized, the party in what is
called the Anti-Rightist Movement. Authors such as Jung Chang have alleged that
the Hundred Flowers Campaign was merely a ruse to root out "dangerous"
thinking. Others such as Dr Li Zhisui have suggested that Mao had initially
seen the policy as a way of weakening those within his party who opposed him,
but was surprised by the extent of criticism and the fact that it began to be
directed at his own leadership. It was only then that he used it as a method of
identifying and subsequently persecuting those critical of his government. The
Hundred Flowers movement led to the condemnation, silencing, and death of many
citizens, also linked to Mao's Anti-Rightist Movement, with death tolls
possibly in the millions. Great Leap Forward. In January 1958, Mao Zedong
launched the second Five-Year Plan, known as the Great Leap Forward, a plan
intended as an alternative model for economic growth to the Soviet model
focusing on heavy industry that was advocated by others in the party. Under
this economic program, the relatively small agricultural collectives which had
been formed to date were rapidly merged into far larger people's communes, and
many of the peasants were ordered to work on massive infrastructure projects
and on the production of iron and steel. Some private food production was
banned; livestock and farm implements were brought under collective ownership.
Under the Great Leap Forward, Mao and other party leaders ordered the
implementation of a variety of unproven and unscientific new agricultural
techniques by the new communes. Combined with the diversion of labor to steel
production and infrastructure projects, these projects combined with cyclical
natural disasters led to an approximately 15% drop in grain production in 1959
followed by a further 10% reduction in 1960 and no recovery in 1961. In an
effort to win favor with their superiors and avoid being purged, each layer in
the party hierarchy exaggerated the amount of grain produced under them. Based
on the fabricated success, party cadres were ordered to requisition a
disproportionately high amount of the true harvest for state use, primarily in
the cities and urban areas but also for export. The net result, which was
compounded in some areas by drought and in others by floods, left rural
peasants with little food for themselves and many millions starved to death in
the largest famine known as the Great Chinese Famine. This famine was a direct
cause of the death of some 30 million Chinese peasants between 1959 and 1962
and about the same number of births were lost or postponed. Further, many
children who became emaciated and malnourished during years of hardship and
struggle for survival died shortly after the Great Leap Forward came to an end
in 1962. The extent of Mao's knowledge of the severity of the situation has
been disputed. According to some, most notably Dr. Li Zhisui, Mao was not aware
that the situation amounted to more than a slight shortage of food and general
supplies until late 1959. Frank Dik√∂tter, Mao's Great Famine, Key Arguments In
"Hungry Ghosts", Jasper Becker notes that Mao was dismissive of reports he
received of food shortages in the countryside and refused to change course,
believing that peasants were lying and that rightists and kulaks were hoarding
grain. He refused to open state granaries, and instead launched a series of
"anti-grain concealment" drives that resulted in numerous purges and suicides.
Other violent campaigns followed in which party leaders went from village to
village in search of hidden food reserves, and not only grain, as Mao issued
quotas for pigs, chickens, ducks and eggs. Many peasants accused of hiding food
were tortured and beaten to death. In contrast, journals such as the "Monthly
Review" have disputed the reliability of the figures commonly cited, the
qualitative evidence of a "massive death toll", and Mao's complicity in those
deaths which occurred. Whatever the case, the Great Leap Forward caused Mao to
lose esteem among many of the top party cadres and was eventually forced to
abandon the policy in 1962, while losing some political power to moderate
leaders, notably Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping in the process. However, Mao,
supported by national propaganda, claimed that he was only partly to blame. As
a result, he was able to remain Chairman of the Communist Party, with the
Presidency transferred to Liu Shaoqi. "We took all the furniture, pots, and
pans we had in our house, and all our neighbors did likewise. We put everything
in a big fire and melted down all the metal." Jasper Becker. "Hungry Ghosts:
Mao's Secret Famine. Holt Paperbacks, 1998. ISBN 0-8050-5668-8 p. 103
Consequences. At the Lushan Conference in July/August 1959, several leaders
expressed concern that the "Great Leap Forward" had not proved as successful as
planned. The most direct of these was Minister of Defence and Korean War
General Peng Dehuai. Mao, fearing loss of his position, orchestrated a purge of
Peng and his supporters, stifling criticism of the Great Leap policies. Senior
officials who reported the truth of the famine to Mao were branded as "right
opportunists." A campaign against right opportunism was launched and resulted
in party members and ordinary peasants being sent to camps where many would
subsequently die in the famine. Years later the CPC would conclude that 6
million people were wrongly punished in the campaign. The number of deaths by
starvation during the Great Leap Forward is deeply controversial. Until the mid
1980s, when official census figures were finally published by the Chinese
Government, little was known about the scale of the disaster in the Chinese
countryside, as the handful of Western observers allowed access during this
time had been restricted to model villages where they were deceived into
believing that the Great Leap Forward had been a great success. There was also
an assumption that the flow of individual reports of starvation that had been
reaching the West, primarily through Hong Kong and Taiwan, must be localized or
exaggerated as China was continuing to claim record harvests and was a net
exporter of grain through the period. Because Mao wanted to pay back early to
the Soviets debts totaling 1.973 billion yuan from 1960 to 1962, exports
increased by 50%, and fellow Communist regimes in North Korea, North Vietnam
and Albania were provided grain free of charge. Censuses were carried out in
China in 1953, 1964 and 1982. The first attempt to analyse this data in order
to estimate the number of famine deaths was carried out by American demographer
Dr. Judith Banister and published in 1984. Given the lengthy gaps between the
censuses and doubts over the reliability of the data, an accurate figure is
difficult to ascertain. Nevertheless, Banister concluded that the official data
implied that around 15 million excess deaths incurred in China during
1958‚Äì61, and that based on her modelling of Chinese demographics during the
period and taking account of assumed under-reporting during the famine years,
the figure was around 30 million. The official statistic is 20 million deaths,
as given by Hu Yaobang. Yang Jisheng, a former Xinhua News Agency reporter who
had privileged access and connections available to no other scholars, estimates
a death toll of 36 million. Frank Dik√∂tter estimates that there were at least
45 million premature deaths attributable to the Great Leap Forward from 1958 to
1962. Various other sources have put the figure at between 20 and 46 million.
On the international front, the period was dominated by the further isolation
of China. The Sino-Soviet split resulted in Nikita Khrushchev's withdrawal of
all Soviet technical experts and aid from the country. The split was triggered
by arguments over the control and direction of world communism and other
disputes pertaining to foreign policy. Most of the problems regarding communist
unity resulted from the death of Joseph Stalin in March 1953 and his
replacement by Khrushchev. Only Albania under the leadership of Enver Hoxha
openly sided with China against the Soviets, which began an alliance between
the two countries which would last until the Sino-Albanian split after Mao's
death in 1976. Stalin had established himself as the successor of "correct"
Marxist thought well before Mao controlled the Communist Party of China, and
therefore Mao never challenged the suitability of any Stalinist doctrine (at
least while Stalin was alive). Upon the death of Stalin, Mao believed (perhaps
because of seniority) that the leadership of the "correct" Marxist doctrine
would fall to him. The resulting tension between Khrushchev (at the head of a
politically and militarily superior government), and Mao (believing he had a
superior understanding of Marxist ideology) eroded the previous patron-client
relationship between the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the CPC. In
China, the formerly favorable Soviets were now denounced as "revisionists" and
listed alongside "American imperialism" as movements to oppose. Partly
surrounded by hostile American military bases (in South Korea, Japan, and
Taiwan), China was now confronted with a new Soviet threat from the north and
west. Both the internal crisis and the external threat called for extraordinary
statesmanship from Mao, but as China entered the new decade the statesmen of
the People's Republic were in hostile confrontation with each other. At a large
Communist Party conference in Beijing in January 1962, called the "Conference
of the Seven Thousand," State Chairman Liu Shaoqi denounced the Great Leap
Forward as responsible for widespread famine. The overwhelming majority of
delegates expressed agreement, but Defense Minister Lin Biao staunchly defended
Mao. A brief period of liberalization followed while Mao and Lin plotted a
comeback. Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping rescued the economy by disbanding the
people's communes, introducing elements of private control of peasant
smallholdings and importing grain from Canada and Australia to mitigate the
worst effects of famine. Cultural Revolution. Mao was concerned with the nature
of post-1959 China. He saw that the revolution had replaced an old elite with a
new one. He was concerned that those in power were becoming estranged from the
people they were supposed to serve. Mao believed that a revolution of culture
would unseat and unsettle the "ruling class" and keep China in a state of
"perpetual revolution" that served the interests of the majority, not a tiny
elite. Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping, then the State Chairman and General
Secretary, respectively, had favored the idea that Mao should be removed from
actual power but maintain his ceremonial and symbolic role, with the party
upholding all of his positive contributions to the revolution. They attempted
to marginalize Mao by taking control of economic policy and asserting
themselves politically as well. Many claim that Mao responded to Liu and Deng's
movements by launching the Cultural Revolution in 1966. Some scholars, such as
Mobo Gao, claim the case for this is perhaps overstated. Others, such as Frank
Dik√∂tter, hold that Mao launched the Cultural Revolution to wreak revenge on
those who had dared to challenge him over the Great Leap Forward. Believing
that certain liberal bourgeois elements of society continued to threaten the
socialist framework, groups of young people known as the Red Guards struggled
against authorities at all levels of society and even set up their own
tribunals. Chaos reigned in many parts of the country, and millions were
persecuted, including a famous philosopher, Chen Yuen. During the Cultural
Revolution, the schools in China were closed and the young intellectuals living
in cities were ordered to the countryside to be "re-educated" by the peasants,
where they performed hard manual labor and other work. The Revolution led to
the destruction of much of China's traditional cultural heritage and the
imprisonment of a huge number of Chinese citizens, as well as creating general
economic and social chaos in the country. Millions of lives were ruined during
this period, as the Cultural Revolution pierced into every part of Chinese
life, depicted by such Chinese films as "To Live", "The Blue Kite" and
"Farewell My Concubine". It is estimated that hundreds of thousands, perhaps
millions, perished in the violence of the Cultural Revolution. When Mao was
informed of such losses, particularly that people had been driven to suicide,
he is alleged to have commented: "People who try to commit suicide¬ ‚Äî don't
attempt to save them!¬ .¬ .¬ . China is such a populous nation, it is not as if
we cannot do without a few people." The authorities allowed the Red Guards to
abuse and kill opponents of the regime. Said Xie Fuzhi, national police chief:
"Don't say it is wrong of them to beat up bad persons: if in anger they beat
someone to death, then so be it." As a result, in August and September 1966,
there were 1,772 people murdered in Beijing alone. It was during this period
that Mao chose Lin Biao, who seemed to echo all of Mao's ideas, to become his
successor. Lin was later officially named as Mao's successor. By 1971, however,
a divide between the two men became apparent. Official history in China states
that Lin was planning a military coup or an assassination attempt on Mao. Lin
Biao died in a plane crash over the air space of Mongolia, presumably on his
way to flee China, probably anticipating his arrest. The CPC declared that Lin
was planning to depose Mao, and posthumously expelled Lin from the party. At
this time, Mao lost trust in many of the top CPC figures. The highest-ranking
Soviet Bloc intelligence defector, Lt. Gen. Ion Mihai Pacepa described his
conversation with Nicolae Ceau≈üescu who told him about a plot to kill Mao
Zedong with the help of Lin Biao organized by the KGB. In 1969, Mao declared
the Cultural Revolution to be over, although the official history of the
People's Republic of China marks the end of the Cultural Revolution in 1976
with Mao's death. In the last years of his life, Mao was faced with declining
health due to either Parkinson's disease or, according to Li Zhisui, motor
neuron disease, as well as lung ailments due to smoking and heart trouble. Some
also attributed Mao's decline in health to the betrayal of Lin Biao. Mao
remained passive as various factions within the Communist Party mobilized for
the power struggle anticipated after his death. This period is often looked at
in official circles in China and in the West as a great stagnation or even of
reversal for China. While many‚Äîan estimated 100 million‚Äîdid suffer, some
scholars, such as Lee Feigon and Mobo Gao, claim there were many great
advances, and in some sectors the Chinese economy continued to outperform the
west. They conclude that the Cultural Revolution period laid the foundation for
the spectacular growth that continues in China. During the Cultural Revolution,
China exploded its first H-Bomb (1967), launched the Dong Fang Hong satellite
(January 30, 1970), commissioned its first nuclear submarines and made various
advances in science and technology. Healthcare was free, and living standards
in the countryside continued to improve. Death. Mao had been in poorer health
for several years and had declined visibly for at least six months prior to his
death. There are unconfirmed reports that he possibly had ALS or Lou Gehrig's
disease. Mao's last public appearance was on May 27, 1976, where he met the
visiting Pakistani Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto during the latter's one-
day visit to Beijing. At around 5:00¬ pm on September 2, 1976, Mao suffered a
heart attack, far more severe than his previous two and affecting a much larger
area of his heart. X-rays indicated that his current lung infection had
worsened, and his urine output dropped to less than 300 cc a day. Mao was awake
and alert throughout the crisis and asked his team of doctors, several times,
whether he was in danger. His condition continued to fluctuate and his life
hung in the balance. Three days later, on September 5, Mao's condition was
still critical, and Hua Guofeng called Jiang Qing back from her trip. She spent
only a few minutes visiting him in Building 202 (where Mao was staying) before
returning to her own residence in the Spring Lotus Chamber. On the afternoon of
September 7, Mao's condition took a turn for the worse. Jiang Qing went to
Building 202 where she learned the news. Mao had just fallen asleep and needed
the rest, but she insisted on rubbing his back and moving his limbs, and she
sprinkled powder on his body. The medical team protested that the dust from the
powder was not good for his lungs, but she instructed the nurses on duty to
follow her example later. The next morning, September 8, she went again. She
demanded the medical staff to change Mao's sleeping position, claiming that he
had been lying too long on his left side. The doctor on duty objected, knowing
that he could breathe only on his left side, but she had him moved nonetheless.
Mao's breathing stopped and his face turned blue. Jiang Qing left the room
while the medical staff put him on a respirator and performed emergency
cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Mao barely revived and Hua Guofeng urged Jiang
Qing not to interfere further with the doctors' work, as her actions were
detrimental to Mao's health and helped cause his death faster. Mao's organs
failed quickly and he fell into a coma shortly before noon where he was put on
life support machines. He was taken off life support over 12 hours later
quarter to midnight and was pronounced dead at 12:10¬ am on September 9, 1976.
September 9 was chosen as the day to let Mao die because it was seen as an easy
day to remember, being the ninth day of the ninth month of the calendar. His
body lay in state at the Great Hall of the People. A memorial service was held
in Tiananmen Square on September 18, 1976. There was a three-minute silence
observed during this service. His body was later placed into the Mausoleum of
Mao Zedong, even though he had wished to be cremated and had been one of the
first high-ranking officials to sign the "Proposal that all Central Leaders be
Cremated after Death" in November 1956. As anticipated after Mao's death, there
was a power struggle for control of China. On one side was the left wing led by
the Gang of Four, who wanted to continue the policy of revolutionary mass
mobilization. On the other side was the right wing opposing these policies.
Among the latter group, the right wing restorationists, led by Chairman Hua
Guofeng, advocated a return to central planning along the Soviet model, whereas
the right wing reformers, led by Deng Xiaoping, wanted to overhaul the Chinese
economy based on market-oriented policies and to de-emphasize the role of
Maoist ideology in determining economic and political policy. Eventually, the
reformers won control of the government. Deng Xiaoping, with clear seniority
over Hua Guofeng, defeated Hua in a bloodless power struggle a few years later.
Legacy. Mao remains a controversial figure and there is little agreement over
his legacy both in China and abroad. He is generally credited and praised with
having unified China and ending the previous decades of civil war. He is also
credited with having improved the status of women in China and improving
literacy and education. His policies caused the deaths of tens of millions of
people during his 27-year reign, more than any other Twentieth Century leader,
however supporters point out that in spite of this, life expectancy improved
during his reign. Supporters claim that he rapidly industrialized China, but
detractors claim that his policies, particularly the Great Leap Forward and the
Cultural Revolution, were impediments to industrialization and modernization.
Supporters claim that his policies laid the groundwork for China's later rise
to become an economic superpower, while detractors claim that his policies
delayed economic development and that China's economy only underwent its rapid
growth after Mao's policies had been widely abandoned. Mao's revolutionary
tactics continue to be used by insurgents, and his political ideology continues
to be embraced by many communist organizations around the world. In mainland
China, Mao is still revered by many supporters of the Communist Party and
respected by a majority of the general population as the "Founding Father of
modern China", credited for giving "the Chinese people dignity and self-
respect." Mobo Gao in his 2008 book "The Battle for China's Past: Mao and the
Cultural Revolution", credits Mao for raising the average life expectancy from
35 in 1949 to 63 by 1975, bringing "unity and stability to a country that had
been plagued by civil wars and foreign invasions", and laying the foundation
for China to "become the equal of the great global powers". Gao also lauds Mao
for carrying out massive land reform, promoting the status of women, improving
popular literacy, and positively "transform(ing) Chinese society beyond
recognition." However, Mao has many Chinese critics, both those who live inside
and outside China. Opposition to Mao is subject to restriction in mainland
China, but is especially strong elsewhere, where he is often reviled as a
brutish ideologue. In the West, his name is generally associated with tyranny
and his economic theories widely discredited ‚Äì though to some political
activists he remains a symbol against capitalism, imperialism and western
influence. Even in China, key pillars of his economic theory have been largely
dismantled by market reformers like Deng Xiaoping and Zhao Ziyang, who
succeeded him as leaders of the Communist Party. Though the Chinese Communist
Party, which Mao led to power, has rejected in practice the economic
fundamentals of much of Mao's ideology, it retains for itself many of the
powers established under Mao's reign: it controls the Chinese army, police,
courts and media and does not permit multi-party elections at the national or
local level, except in Hong Kong. Thus it is difficult to gauge the true extent
of support for the Chinese Communist Party and Mao's legacy within mainland
China. For their part, the Chinese government continues to officially regard
Mao as a national hero. In 2008, China opened the Mao Zedong Square to visitors
in his hometown of central Hunan Province to mark the 115th anniversary of his
birth.  Chang and Halliday take literally Mao's penchant for talking about mass
death in highly irresponsible, provocative, callous and reckless ways,
exemplified by his famous remark that in a nuclear war, half of China's
population would perish but the rest would survive and rebuild. In 1958, when
ruminating about the dialectics of life and death, he thought that deaths were
beneficial, for without them, there could be no renewal. Imagine, he asked,
what a disaster it would be if Confucius were still alive. "When people die
there ought to be celebrations." In December 1958 he remarked that "destruction
("mi√®w√°ng" ÁÅ≠‰∫°, also extinction) people has advantages. One can make
fertilizer. You say you can't, but actually you can, but you must be
spiritually prepared." The authors note that these kinds of remarks could well
have justified the indifference of lower-level cadres to peasant deaths. Mass
killings are not usually associated with Mao and the Great Leap Forward, and
China continues to benefit from a more favourable comparison with Cambodia or
the Soviet Union. But as fresh and abundant archival evidence shows, coercion,
terror and systematic violence were the foundation of the Great Leap, and
between 1958 to 1962, by a rough approximation, some 6 to 8 per cent of those
who died were tortured to death or summarily killed ‚Äì amounting to at least 3
million victims. Countless others were deliberately deprived of food and
starved to death. Many more vanished because they were too old, weak or sick to
work ‚Äì and hence unable to earn their keep. People were killed selectively
because they had the wrong class background, because they dragged their feet,
because they spoke out or simply because they were not liked, for whatever
reason, by the man who wielded the ladle in the canteen. Dik√∂tter argues that
CPC leaders "glorified violence and were inured to massive loss of life. And
all of them shared an ideology in which the end justified the means. In 1962,
having lost millions of people in his province, Li Jingquan compared the Great
Leap Forward to the Long March in which only one in ten had made it to the end:
'We are not weak, we are stronger, we have kept the backbone.'" Regarding the
large-scale irrigation projects, Dik√∂tter stresses that, in spite of Mao being
in a good position to see the human cost, they continued unabated for several
years, and ultimately claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of exhausted
villagers. He also notes that "In a chilling precursor of Cambodia under the
Khmer Rouge, villagers in Qingshui and Gansu called these projects the 'killing
fields'." The United States placed a trade embargo on the People's Republic as
a result of its involvement in the Korean War, lasting until Richard Nixon
decided that developing relations with the PRC would be useful in dealing with
the Soviet Union. Roderick MacFarquhar has stated: "What Mao accomplished
between 1949 and 1956 was in fact the fastest, most extensive, and least
damaging socialist revolution carried out in any communist state." Mao's
military writings continue to have a large amount of influence both among those
who seek to create an insurgency and those who seek to crush one, especially in
manners of guerrilla warfare, at which Mao is popularly regarded as a genius.
As an example, the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) followed Mao's examples of
guerrilla warfare to considerable political and military success even in the
21st century. Mao's major contribution to the military science is his theory of
People's War, with not only guerrilla warfare but more importantly, Mobile
Warfare methodologies. Mao had successfully applied Mobile Warfare in the
Korean War, and was able to encircle, push back and then halt the UN forces in
Korea, despite the clear superiority of UN firepower. Mao also gave the
impression that he might even welcome a nuclear war. Soviet historians have
written that Mao believed his country could survive a nuclear war, even if it
lost 300 million people. Dik√∂tter, Frank. "Mao's Great Famine: The History of
China's Most Devastating Catastrophe, 1958‚Äì62." Walker & Company, 2010. p.13.
ISBN 0-8027-7768-6 But historians dispute the sincerity of Mao's words. Robert
Service says that Mao "was deadly serious," while Frank Dik√∂tter claims that
"He was bluffing... the sabre-rattling was to show that he, not Khrushchev, was
the more determined revolutionary." Mao's poems and writings are frequently
cited by both Chinese and non-Chinese. The official Chinese translation of
President Barack Obama's inauguration speech used a famous line from one of
Mao's poems. Peru's Shining Path, and the Nepalese revolutionary movement.
Under the influence of Mao's agrarian socialism and Cultural Revolution,
Cambodia's Pol Pot conceived of his disastrous Year Zero policies which purged
the nation of its teachers, artists and intellectuals and emptied its cities,
resulting in the Cambodian Genocide. The Revolutionary Communist Party, USA
also claims Marxism-Leninism-Maoism as its ideology, as do other Communist
Parties around the world which are part of the Revolutionary Internationalist
Movement. China itself has moved sharply away from Maoism since Mao's death,
and most people outside of China who describe themselves as Maoist regard the
Deng Xiaoping reforms to be a betrayal of Maoism, in line with Mao's view of
"Capitalist roaders" within the Communist Party. As the Chinese government
instituted free market economic reforms starting in the late 1970s and as later
Chinese leaders took power, less recognition was given to the status of Mao.
This accompanied a decline in state recognition of Mao in later years in
contrast to previous years when the state organized numerous events and
seminars commemorating Mao's 100th birthday. Nevertheless, the Chinese
government has never officially repudiated the tactics of Mao. Deng Xiaoping,
who was opposed to the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, has to a
certain extent rejected Mao's legacy, famously saying that Mao was "70% right
and 30% wrong". In the mid-1990s, Mao Zedong's picture began to appear on all
new renminbi (‰∫∫Ê∞ëÂπ£) currency from the People's Republic of China. This was
officially instituted as an anti-counterfeiting measure as Mao's face is widely
recognized in contrast to the generic figures that appear in older currency. On
March 13, 2006, a story in the "People's Daily" reported that a proposal had
been made to print the portraits of Sun Yat-sen and Deng Xiaoping. In 2006, the
government in Shanghai issued a new set of high school history textbooks which
omit Mao, with the exception of a single mention in a section on etiquette.
Students in Shanghai now only learn about Mao in junior high school. Public
image. Mao gave contradicting statements on the subject of personality cults.
In 1955, as a response to the Khrushchev Report that criticized Joseph Stalin,
Mao stated that personality cults are "poisonous ideological survivals of the
old society", and reaffirmed China's commitment to collective leadership. But
at the 1958 Party congress in Chengdu, Mao expressed support for the
personality cults of genuinely worthy figures; not those that expressed "blind
worship". In 1962, Mao proposed the Socialist Education Movement (SEM) in an
attempt to educate the peasants to resist the "temptations" of feudalism and
the sprouts of capitalism that he saw re-emerging in the countryside from Liu's
economic reforms. Large quantities of politicized art were produced and
circulated¬ ‚Äî with Mao at the center. Numerous posters, badges and musical
compositions referenced Mao in the phrase "Chairman Mao is the red sun in our
hearts" (, "M√°o Zh«îx√≠ Sh√¨ W«ímen Xƒ´nzh≈çng De H√≥ng T√ iy√°ng") and a
"Savior of the people" (, "R√©nm√≠n De D√  Ji√πxƒ´ng"). In October 1966, Mao's
"Quotations From Chairman Mao Tse-Tung", which was known as the "Little Red
Book" was published. Party members were encouraged to carry a copy with them
and possession was almost mandatory as a criterion for membership. Over the
years, Mao's image became displayed almost everywhere, present in homes,
offices and shops. His quotations were typographically emphasized by putting
them in boldface or red type in even the most obscure writings. Music from the
period emphasized Mao's stature, as did children's rhymes. The phrase "Long
Live Chairman Mao for ten thousand years" was commonly heard during the era.
Mao also has a presence in China and around the world in popular culture, where
his face adorns everything from t-shirts to coffee cups. Mao's granddaughter,
Kong Dongmei, defended the phenomenon, stating that "it shows his influence,
that he exists in people's consciousness and has influenced several generations
of Chinese people's way of life. Just like Che Guevara's image, his has become
a symbol of revolutionary culture." Since 1950, over 40 million people have
visited Mao's birthplace in Shaoshan, Hunan. Genealogy. Siblings. Note that the
character "z√©" (Ê≥Ω) appears in all of the siblings' given names. This is a
common Chinese naming convention. From the next generation, Zemin's son, Mao
Yuanxin, was raised by Mao Zedong's family. He became Mao Zedong's liaison with
the Politburo in 1975. Sources like Li Zhisui ("The Private Life of Chairman
Mao") say that he played a role in the final power-struggles. Children. Mao's
first and second daughters were left to local villagers because it was too
dangerous to raise them while fighting the Kuomintang and later the Japanese.
Their youngest daughter (born in early 1938 in Moscow after Mao separated) and
one other child (born 1933) died in infancy. Two English researchers who
retraced the entire Long March route in 2002‚Äì2003 located a woman whom they
believe might well be one of the missing children abandoned by Mao to peasants
in 1935. Ed Jocelyn and Andrew McEwen hope a member of the Mao family will
respond to requests for a DNA test. Personal life. Mao's private life was very
secretive at the time of his rule. However, after Mao's death, his personal
physician Li Zhisui published a memoir which mentions some aspects of Mao's
private life, such as chain-smoking cigarettes, rare bathing or dental habits,
laziness, addiction to sleeping pills and large number of sexual partners.
Having grown up in Hunan, Mao spoke Mandarin with a heavy Xiang Chinese accent
that is very pronounced on recordings of his speeches. Journalist Clare
Hollingworth noted that Mao was proud of his "peasant ways and manners", having
a strong Hunanese accent and providing "earthy" comments on sexual matters.
Similarly, historian Lee Feigon noted that Mao's "earthiness" meant that he
remained connected to "everyday Chinese life." Biographer Peter Carter noted
that throughout his life, Mao had the ability to gain people's trust, and that
as such he gathered around him "an extraordinarily wide range of friends" in
his early years. Writings and calligraphy. Mao was also a skilled Chinese
calligrapher with a highly personal style. In China, Mao was considered a
master calligrapher during his lifetime. His calligraphy can be seen today
throughout mainland China. His work gave rise to a new form of Chinese
calligraphy called "Mao-style" or "Maoti", which has gained increasing
popularity since his death. There currently exist various competitions
specializing in Mao-style calligraphy. Literary works. As did most Chinese
intellectuals of his generation, Mao received rigorous education in Chinese
classical literature. His style was deeply influenced by the great Tang Dynasty
poets Li Bai and Li He. He is considered to be a romantic poet, in contrast to
the realist poets represented by Du Fu. Many of Mao's poems are still popular
in China and a few are taught as a mandatory part of the elementary school
curriculum. Some of his most well-known poems are: "Changsha" (1925), "The
Double Ninth" (1929.10), "Loushan Pass" (1935), "The Long March" (1935), "Snow"
(1936), "The PLA Captures Nanjing" (1949), "Reply to Li Shuyi" (1957.05.11),
and "Ode to the Plum Blossom" (1961.12).
