United Kingdom The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign state
located off the north-western coast of continental Europe. The country includes
the island of Great Britain, the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland,
and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that
shares a land border with another sovereign stateâ€”the Republic of Ireland.
Apart from this land border the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, the
North Sea, the English Channel and the Irish Sea. The United Kingdom is a
unitary state governed under a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary
system, with its seat of government in the capital city of London. It is a
country in its own right and consists of four constituent countries: England,
Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. The latter three of these are devolved
administrations, each with varying powers, based in their capital cities
Belfast, Edinburgh and Cardiff respectively. Associated with the UK, but not
constitutionally part of it, are the three Crown dependencies: Guernsey, Jersey
and the Isle of Man. The United Kingdom has fourteen British Overseas
Territories. These are remnants of the British Empire which, at its height in
1922, encompassed almost a quarter of the world's land surface and was the
largest empire in history. British influence can still be observed in the
language, culture and legal systems of many of its former territories. The UK
is a developed country and has the world's seventh-largest economy by nominal
GDP and eighth-largest economy by purchasing power parity. It was the world's
first industrialised country and the world's foremost power during the 19th and
early 20th centuries. The UK remains a great power with leading economic,
cultural, military, scientific and political influence. It is a recognised
nuclear weapons state and its military expenditure ranks fourth in the world.
The UK has been a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council since
its first session in 1946. It has been a member of the European Union and its
predecessor the European Economic Community since 1973. It is also a member of
the Commonwealth of Nations, the Council of Europe, the G7, the G8, the G20,
NATO, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the
World Trade Organization. Etymology and terminology. The name "United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Northern Ireland" was introduced in 1927 by the Royal and
Parliamentary Titles Act. It reflected the reality that the "de facto"
independence of the Irish Free State, created by the partitioning of Ireland in
1922, left Northern Ireland as the only part of the island of Ireland still
within the UK. Prior to this, the Acts of Union 1800, that united the Kingdom
of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland in 1801, had given the new state
the name of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Great Britain
before 1801 is occasionally referred to as the "United Kingdom of Great
Britain". However, Section 1 of both of the 1707 Acts of Union declare that
England and Scotland are "United into One Kingdom by the Name of Great
Britain". The term "united kingdom" is found in informal use during the 18th
century to describe the new state but only became official with the union with
Ireland in 1801. Although the United Kingdom, as a sovereign state, is a
country, England, Scotland, Wales and (more controversially) Northern Ireland
are also referred to as countries, although they are not sovereign states and
only Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have devolved self-government. The
British Prime Minister's website has used the phrase "countries within a
country" to describe the United Kingdom. With regard to Northern Ireland, the
descriptive name used "can be controversial, with the choice often revealing
one's political preferences." Other terms used for Northern Ireland include
"region" and "province". The United Kingdom is often referred to as "Britain".
British government sources frequently use the term as a short form for the
United Kingdom, whilst media style guides generally allow its use but point out
that the longer term "Great Britain" refers only to the main island which
includes England, Scotland and Wales. However, some foreign usage, particularly
in the United States, uses "Great Britain" as a loose synonym for the "United
Kingdom". Also, the United Kingdom's Olympic team competes under the name
"Great Britain" or "Team GB". "GB" and "GBR" are the standard country codes for
the United Kingdom (see and ISO 3166-1 alpha-3) and are consequently commonly
used by international organisations to refer to the United Kingdom. In 2006, a
new design of British passport entered into use. Its first page shows the long
form name of the state in English, Welsh and Scottish Gaelic. In Welsh, the
long form name of the state is "Teyrnas Unedig Prydain Fawr a Gogledd Iwerddon"
with "Teyrnas Unedig" being used as a short form name on government websites.
In Scottish Gaelic, the long form is "RÃ¬oghachd Aonaichte na Breatainne MÃ²ire
is Ãˆireann a Tuath" and the short form "RÃ¬oghachd Aonaichte". The adjective
"British" is commonly used to refer to matters relating to the United Kingdom.
The term has no definite legal connotation, however, it is used in law to refer
to UK citizenship and matters to do with nationality. British people use a
number of different terms to describe their national identity and may identify
themselves as being British; or as being English, Scottish, Welsh, Northern
Irish, or Irish; or as being both. History. Before 1707. Settlement by
anatomically modern humans of what was to become the United Kingdom occurred in
waves beginning by about 30,000 years ago. By the end of the region's
prehistoric period, the population is thought to have belonged, in the main, to
a culture termed Insular Celtic, comprising Brythonic Britain and Gaelic
Ireland. The Roman conquest, beginning in 43 AD, and the 400-year rule of
southern Britain, was followed by an invasion by Germanic Anglo-Saxon settlers,
reducing the Brythonic area mainly to what was to become Wales. Most of the
region settled by the Anglo-Saxons became unified as the Kingdom of England in
the 10th century. Meanwhile, Gaelic-speakers in north west Britain (with
connections to the north-east of Ireland and traditionally supposed to have
migrated from there in the 5th century) united with the Picts to create the
Kingdom of Scotland in the 9th century. In 1066, the Normans invaded England
and after its conquest, seized large parts of Wales, conquered much of Ireland
and settled in Scotland bringing to each country feudalism on the Northern
French model and Norman-French culture. The Norman elites greatly influenced,
but eventually assimilated with, each of the local cultures. Subsequent
medieval English kings completed the conquest of Wales and made an ultimately
unsuccessful attempt to annex Scotland. Thereafter, Scotland maintained its
independence, albeit in near-constant conflict with England. The English
monarchs, through inheritance of substantial territories in France and claims
to the French crown, were also heavily involved in conflicts in France, most
notably the Hundred Years War. The early modern period saw religious conflict
resulting from the Reformation and the introduction of Protestant state
churches in each country. Wales was fully incorporated into the Kingdom of
England, and Ireland was constituted as a kingdom in personal union with the
English crown. In what was to become Northern Ireland, the lands of the
independent Catholic Gaelic nobility were confiscated and given to Protestant
settlers from England and Scotland. In 1603, the kingdoms of England, Scotland
and Ireland were united in a personal union when James VI, King of Scots,
inherited the crowns of England and Ireland and moved his court from Edinburgh
to London; each country nevertheless remained a separate political entity and
retained its separate political institutions. In the mid-17th century, all
three kingdoms were involved in a series of connected wars (including the
English Civil War) which led to the temporary overthrow of the monarchy and the
establishment of the short-lived unitary republic of the Commonwealth of
England, Scotland and Ireland. Although the monarchy was restored, it ensured
(with the Glorious Revolution of 1688) that, unlike much of the rest of Europe,
royal absolutism would not prevail. The British constitution would develop on
the basis of constitutional monarchy and the parliamentary system. During this
period, particularly in England, the development of naval power (and the
interest in voyages of discovery) led to the acquisition and settlement of
overseas colonies, particularly in North America. Since the Acts of Union of
1707. On 1 May 1707 a new kingdom of Great Britain was created by the political
union of the kingdoms of England and Scotland in accordance with the Treaty of
Union, negotiated the previous year and ratified by the English and Scottish
Parliaments passing Acts of Union. In the 18th century, the country played an
important role in developing Western ideas of the parliamentary system and in
making significant contributions to literature, the arts, and science. The
British-led Industrial Revolution transformed the country and fuelled the
growing British Empire. During this time Britain, like other great powers, was
involved in colonial exploitation, including the Atlantic slave trade, although
with the passing of the Slave Trade Act of 1807 the UK took a leading role in
battling the trade in slaves. The colonies in North America had been the main
focus of British colonial activity. With their loss in the American War of
Independence, imperial ambition turned elsewhere, particularly to India. In
1800, while the wars with France still raged, the Parliaments of Great Britain
and Ireland each passed an Act of Union, uniting the two kingdoms and creating
the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, which came into being on 1
January 1801. After the defeat of France in the Revolutionary and Napoleonic
Wars (1792â€“1815), the UK emerged as the principal naval and economic power of
the 19th century (with London the largest city in the world from about 1830)
Unchallenged at sea, Britain adopted the role of global policeman, a state of
affairs later known as the "Pax Britannica". It was also a period of rapid
economic, colonial, and industrial growth. Britain was described as the
"workshop of the world", and the British Empire grew to include India, large
parts of Africa, and many other territories. Alongside the formal control it
exerted over its own colonies, Britain's dominant position in world trade meant
that it effectively controlled the economies of many countries, such as China,
Argentina and Siam. Domestically, there was a shift to free trade and laissez-
faire policies and a very significant widening of the voting franchise. The
country experienced a huge population increase during the century, accompanied
by rapid urbanisation, causing significant social and economic stresses. By the
end of the century, other states began to challenge Britain's industrial
dominance. The UK, along with Russia, France and (after 1917) the US, was one
of the major powers opposing the German Empire and its allies in World War I
(1914â€“18). The UK armed forces grew to over five million people engaged
across much of its empire and several regions of Europe, and increasingly took
a major role on the Western front. The nation suffered some two and a half
million casualties and finished the war with a huge national debt. After the
war the United Kingdom received the League of Nations mandate over former
German and Ottoman colonies, and the British Empire had expanded to its
greatest extent, covering a fifth of the world's land surface and a quarter of
its population. The rise of Irish Nationalism and disputes within Ireland over
the terms of Irish Home Rule led eventually to the partition of the island in
1921, and the Irish Free State became independent with Dominion status in 1922,
while Northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom. The Great
Depression (1929â€“32) occurred when the UK had not recovered from the effects
of the war, and led to hardship as well as political and social unrest. The
United Kingdom was one of the Allies of World War II and an original signatory
to the Declaration of the United Nations. Following the defeat of its European
allies in the first year of the war, the United Kingdom continued the fight
against Germany, notably in the Battle of Britain and the Battle of the
Atlantic. After the victory, the UK was one of the Big Three powers that met to
plan the postwar world. The war left the country financially damaged. Marshall
Aid and loans from both the United States and Canada helped the UK on the road
to recovery. The Labour government in the immediate post-war years initiated a
radical programme of changes, with a significant impact on British society in
the following decades. Domestically, major industries and public utilities were
nationalised, a Welfare State was established, and a comprehensive publicly
funded healthcare system, the National Health Service, was created. In response
to the rise of local nationalism, the Labour government's own ideological
sympathies and Britain's now diminished economic position, a policy of
decolonisation was initiated, starting with the granting of independence to
India and Pakistan in 1947. Over the next three decades, most territories of
the Empire gained independence and became sovereign members of the Commonwealth
of Nations. Although the new postwar limits of Britain's political role were
illustrated by the Suez Crisis of 1956, the UK nevertheless became one of the
five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and was the third
country to develop a nuclear weapons arsenal (with its first atomic bomb test
in 1952). The international spread of the English language also ensured the
continuing international influence of its literature and culture, while from
the 1960s its popular culture also found influence abroad. As a result of a
shortage of workers in the 1950s, the British Government encouraged immigration
from Commonwealth countries, thereby transforming Britain into a multi-ethnic
society in the following decades. In 1973, the UK joined the European Economic
Community (EEC), and when the EEC became the European Union (EU) in 1992, it
was one of the 12 founding members. From the late 1960s Northern Ireland
suffered communal and paramilitary violence (sometimes affecting other parts of
the UK and also the Republic of Ireland) conventionally known as the Troubles.
It is usually considered to have ended with the Belfast "Good Friday" Agreement
of 1998. Following a period of widespread economic slowdown and industrial
strife in the 1970s, the Conservative Government of the 1980s initiated a
radical policy of deregulation, particularly of the financial sector, flexible
labour markets, the sale of state-owned companies (privatisation), and the
withdrawal of subsidies to others. Aided, from 1984, by the inflow of
substantial North Sea oil revenues, the UK experienced a period of significant
economic growth. Around the end of the 20th century there were major changes to
the governance of the UK with the establishment of devolved national
administrations for Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales following pre-
legislative referendums, and the statutory incorporation of the European
Convention on Human Rights. Domestic controversy surrounded some of Britain's
overseas military deployments in the 2000s (decade), particularly in Iraq and
Afghanistan. Geography. The total area of the United Kingdom is approximately .
The country occupies the major part of the British Isles archipelago and
includes the island of Great Britain, the north-eastern one-sixth of the island
of Ireland and some smaller surrounding islands. It lies between the North
Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea with the south-east coast coming within of the
coast of northern France, from which it is separated by the English Channel.
10% of the UK was forested, 46% used for pastures and 25% used for agriculture.
The Royal Greenwich Observatory in London is the defining point of the Prime
Meridian. The United Kingdom lies between latitudes 49Â° to 61Â° N, and
longitudes 9Â° W to 2Â° E. Northern Ireland shares a land boundary with the
Republic of Ireland. The coastline of Great Britain is long. It is connected to
continental Europe by the Channel Tunnel, which at ( underwater) is the longest
underwater tunnel in the world. England accounts for just over half of the
total area of the UK, covering . Most of the country consists of lowland
terrain, with mountainous terrain north-west of the Tees-Exe line; including
the Cumbrian Mountains of the Lake District, the Pennines and limestone hills
of the Peak District, Exmoor and Dartmoor. The main rivers and estuaries are
the Thames, Severn and the Humber. England's highest mountain is Scafell Pike
() in the Lake District. Its principal rivers are the Severn, Thames, Humber,
Tees, Tyne, Tweed, Avon, Exe and Mersey. Scotland accounts for just under a
third of the total area of the UK, covering and including nearly eight hundred
islands, predominantly west and north of the mainland; notably the Hebrides,
Orkney Islands and Shetland Islands. The topography of Scotland is
distinguished by the Highland Boundary Faultâ€”a geological rock
fractureâ€”which traverses Scotland from Arran in the west to Stonehaven in the
east. The faultline separates two distinctively different regions; namely the
Highlands to the north and west and the lowlands to the south and east. The
more rugged Highland region contains the majority of Scotland's mountainous
land, including Ben Nevis which at is the highest point in the British Isles.
Lowland areas, especially the narrow waist of land between the Firth of Clyde
and the Firth of Forth known as the Central Belt, are flatter and home to most
of the population including Glasgow, Scotland's largest city, and Edinburgh,
its capital and political centre. Wales accounts for less than a tenth of the
total area of the UK, covering . Wales is mostly mountainous, though South
Wales is less mountainous than North and mid Wales. The main population and
industrial areas are in South Wales, consisting of the coastal cities of
Cardiff, Swansea and Newport, and the South Wales Valleys to their north. The
highest mountains in Wales are in Snowdonia and include Snowdon () which, at ,
is the highest peak in Wales. The 14, or possibly 15, Welsh mountains over
3,000Â feet (914Â m) high are known collectively as the Welsh 3000s. Wales has
over of coastline. There are several islands off the Welsh mainland, the
largest of which is Anglesey ("Ynys MÃ´n") in the northwest. Northern Ireland
accounts for just and is mostly hilly. It includes Lough Neagh which, at , is
the largest lake in the British Isles by area. The highest peak in Northern
Ireland is Slieve Donard in the Mourne Mountains at . Climate. The United
Kingdom has a temperate climate, with plentiful rainfall all year round. The
temperature varies with the seasons seldom dropping below or rising above . The
prevailing wind is from the south-west and bears frequent spells of mild and
wet weather from the Atlantic Ocean, although the eastern parts are mostly
sheltered from this windâ€”as the majority of the rain falls over the western
regions the eastern parts are therefore the driest. Atlantic currents, warmed
by the Gulf Stream, bring mild winters; especially in the west where winters
are wet and even more so over high ground. Summers are warmest in the south-
east of England, being closest to the European mainland, and coolest in the
north. Heavy snowfall can occur in winter and early spring on high ground, and
occasionally settles to great depth away from the hills. Administrative
divisions. Each country of the United Kingdom has its own system of
administrative and geographic demarcation, which often has origins that pre-
date the formation of the United Kingdom itself. Consequently there is "no
common stratum of administrative unit encompassing the United Kingdom". Until
the 19th century there was little change to those arrangements, but there has
since been a constant evolution of role and function. Change did not occur in a
uniform manner and the devolution of power over local government to Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland means that future changes are unlikely to be uniform
either. The organisation of local government in England is complex, with the
distribution of functions varying according to the local arrangements.
Legislation concerning local government in England is decided by the UK
parliament and the Government of the United Kingdom, as England does not have a
devolved parliament. The upper-tier subdivisions of England are the nine
Government office regions or European Union government office regions. One
region, Greater London, has had a directly elected assembly and mayor since
2000 following popular support for the proposal in a referendum. It was
intended that other regions would also be given their own elected regional
assemblies, but a proposed assembly in the North East region was rejected by a
referendum in 2004 Below the region level England has either county councils
and district councils or unitary authorities and London which consists of 32
London boroughs. Councillors are elected by the first-past-the-post system in
single-member wards or by the multi-member plurality system in multi-member
wards. Local government in Scotland is divided on a basis of 32 council areas,
with wide variation in both size and population. The cities of Glasgow,
Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee are separate council areas as is the Highland
Council which includes a third of Scotland's area but just over
200,000Â people. The power invested in local authorities is administered by
elected councillors, of which there are currently 1,222 and are each paid a
part-time salary. Elections are conducted by single transferable vote in multi-
member wards that elect either three or four councillors. Each council elects a
Provost, or Convenor, to chair meetings of the council and to act as a
figurehead for the area. Councillors are subject to a code of conduct enforced
by the Standards Commission for Scotland. The representative association of
Scotland's local authorities is the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities
(COSLA). Local government in Wales consists of 22 unitary authorities. These
include the cities of Cardiff, Swansea and Newport which are unitary
authorities in their own right. Elections are held every four years under the
first-past-the-post system. The most recent elections were held in May 2008.
The Welsh Local Government Association represents the interests of local
authorities in Wales. Local government in Northern Ireland has, since 1973,
been organised into 26 district councils, each elected by single transferable
vote. Their powers are limited to services such as collecting waste,
controlling dogs, and maintaining parks and cemeteries. On 13 March 2008 the
executive agreed on proposals to create 11 new councils and replace the present
system. The next local elections were postponed until 2011 to facilitate this.
Dependencies. The United Kingdom has sovereignty over seventeen territories
which do not form part of the United Kingdom itself: fourteen British Overseas
Territories and three Crown Dependencies. The fourteen British Overseas
Territories are: Anguilla; Bermuda; the British Antarctic Territory; the
British Indian Ocean Territory; the British Virgin Islands; the Cayman Islands;
the Falkland Islands; Gibraltar; Montserrat; Saint Helena, Ascension and
Tristan da Cunha; the Turks and Caicos Islands; the Pitcairn Islands; South
Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands; and the Sovereign Base Areas on Cyprus.
British claims in Antarctica are not universally recognised. Collectively
Britain's overseas territories encompass an approximate land area of and a
population of approximately 260,000 people. They are the remnants of the
British Empire and several have specifically voted to remain British
territories (Bermuda in 1995 and Gibraltar in 2002). The Crown Dependencies are
British possessions of the Crown, as opposed to overseas territories of the UK.
They comprise the Channel Island Bailiwicks of Jersey and Guernsey in the
English Channel and the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea. Being independently
administered jurisdictions they do not form part of the United Kingdom or of
the European Union, although the UK government manages their foreign affairs
and defence and the UK Parliament has the authority to legislate on their
behalf. The power to pass legislation affecting the islands ultimately rests
with their own respective legislative assemblies, with the assent of the Crown
(Privy Council or, in the case of the Isle of Man, in certain circumstances the
Lieutenant-Governor). Since 2005 each Crown dependency has had a Chief Minister
as its head of government. Politics. The United Kingdom is a unitary state
under a constitutional monarchy. Queen Elizabeth II is the head of state of the
UK as well as of fifteen other independent Commonwealth countries. The monarch
has "the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, and the right to warn".
The United Kingdom has an uncodified constitution, as do only three other
countries in the world. The Constitution of the United Kingdom thus consists
mostly of a collection of disparate written sources, including statutes, judge-
made case law and international treaties, together with constitutional
conventions. As there is no technical difference between ordinary statutes and
"constitutional law" the UK Parliament can perform "constitutional reform"
simply by passing Acts of Parliament and thus has the political power to change
or abolish almost any written or unwritten element of the constitution.
However, no Parliament can pass laws that future Parliaments cannot change.
Government. The UK has a parliamentary government based on the Westminster
system that has been emulated around the worldâ€”a legacy of the British
Empire. The parliament of the United Kingdom that meets in the Palace of
Westminster has two houses; an elected House of Commons and an appointed House
of Lords. Any bill passed requires Royal Assent to become law. The position of
prime minister, the UK's head of government, belongs to the member of
parliament who can obtain the confidence of a majority in the House of Commons,
usually the current leader of the largest political party in that chamber. The
prime minister and cabinet are formally appointed by the monarch to form Her
Majesty's Government, though the prime minister chooses the cabinet and, by
convention, the Queen respects the prime minister's choices. The cabinet is
traditionally drawn from members of the Prime Minister's party in both
legislative houses, and mostly from the House of Commons, to which they are
responsible. Executive power is exercised by the prime minister and cabinet,
all of whom are sworn into the Privy Council of the United Kingdom, and become
Ministers of the Crown. The Rt. Hon. David Cameron, leader of the Conservative
Party, has been Prime Minister, First Lord of the Treasury and Minister for the
Civil Service since 11 May 2010. For elections to the House of Commons, the UK
is currently divided into 650 constituencies with each electing a single member
of parliament by simple plurality. General elections are called by the monarch
when the prime minister so advises. The Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949 require
that a new election must be called within five years of the previous general
election. The UK's three major political parties are the Conservative Party,
the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats. During the 2010 general election
these three parties won 622 out of 650 seats available in the House of Commons:
621 seats at the general election and 1 more at the delayed by-election in
Thirsk and Malton. Most of the remaining seats were won by minor parties that
only contest elections in one part of the UK: the Scottish National Party
(Scotland only); Plaid Cymru (Wales only); and the Democratic Unionist Party,
Social Democratic and Labour Party, Ulster Unionist Party, and Sinn FÃ©in
(Northern Ireland only, though Sinn FÃ©in also contests elections in the
Republic of Ireland). In accordance with party policy no elected Sinn FÃ©in
member of parliament has ever attended the House of Commons to speak on behalf
of their constituentsÂ â€“ this is because members of parliament are required
to take an oath of allegiance to the monarch. The current five Sinn FÃ©in MPs
have however, since 2002, made use of the offices and other facilities
available at Westminster. For elections to the European Parliament the UK
currently has 72 MEPs, elected in 12 multi-member constituencies. Devolved
administrations. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland each have their own
devolved government or executive, led by a First Minister (or, in the case of
Northern Ireland, a diarchal First Minister and deputy First Minister), and a
devolved unicameral legislature. England, the largest country of the United
Kingdom, has no devolved executive or legislature and is administered and
legislated for directly by the UK government and parliament on all issues. This
situation has given rise to the so-called West Lothian question which concerns
the fact that MPs from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland can vote, sometimes
decisively, on matters affecting England that are handled by devolved
legislatures for their own constituencies. The Scottish Government and
Parliament have wide-ranging powers over any matter that has not been
specifically 'reserved' to the UK parliament, including education, healthcare,
Scots law and local government. At the 2011 elections the SNP won re-election
and achieved an overall majority in the Scottish parliament, with its leader,
Alex Salmond, as First Minister of Scotland. The Welsh Government and the
National Assembly for Wales have more limited powers than those devolved to
Scotland. The Assembly is able to legislate on devolved matters through Acts of
the Assembly, which require no prior consent from Westminster. The 2011
elections resulted in a minority Labour administration led by Carwyn Jones. The
Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly have powers closer to those already
devolved to Scotland. The Executive is led by a diarchy representing unionist
and nationalist members of the Assembly. Currently, Peter Robinson (Democratic
Unionist Party) and Martin McGuinness (Sinn FÃ©in) are First Minister and
deputy First Minister respectively. The United Kingdom does not have a codified
constitution and constitutional matters are not among the powers devolved to
Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. Under the doctrine of Parliamentary
sovereignty, the UK Parliament could, in theory, therefore, abolish the
Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly or Northern Ireland Assembly. Indeed, in
1972, the UK Parliament unilaterally prorogued the Parliament of Northern
Ireland, setting a precedent relevant to contemporary devolved institutions. In
practice, the circumstances in which the UK Parliament would abolish devolution
given the political constraints created by referendum decisions are unclear.
The political constraints placed upon the UK Parliament's power to interfere
with devolution in Northern Ireland are greater than in relation to Scotland
and Wales, given that devolution in Northern Ireland rests upon an
international agreement with the Government of Ireland. Law and criminal
justice. The United Kingdom does not have a single legal system, as Article 19
of the 1706 Treaty of Union provided for the continuation of Scotland's
separate legal system. Today the UK has three distinct systems of law: English
law, Northern Ireland law and Scots law. A new Supreme Court of the United
Kingdom came into being in October 2009 to replace the Appellate Committee of
the House of Lords. The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, including the
same members as the Supreme Court, is the highest court of appeal for several
independent Commonwealth countries, the British Overseas Territories, and the
Crown Dependencies. Both English law, which applies in England and Wales, and
Northern Ireland law are based on common-law principles. The essence of common
law is that, subject to statute, the law is developed by judges in courts,
applying statute, precedent and common sense to the facts before them to give
explanatory judgements of the relevant legal principles, which are reported and
binding in future similar cases ("stare decisis"). The courts of England and
Wales are headed by the Senior Courts of England and Wales, consisting of the
Court of Appeal, the High Court of Justice (for civil cases) and the Crown
Court (for criminal cases). The Supreme Court is the highest court in the land
for both criminal and civil appeal cases in England, Wales, and Northern
Ireland and any decision it makes is binding on every other court in the same
jurisdiction, often having a persuasive effect in other jurisdictions. Scots
law is a hybrid system based on both common-law and civil-law principles. The
chief courts are the Court of Session, for civil cases, and the High Court of
Justiciary, for criminal cases. The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom serves
as the highest court of appeal for civil cases under Scots law. Sheriff courts
deal with most civil and criminal cases including conducting criminal trials
with a jury, known as sheriff solemn court, or with a sheriff and no jury,
known as sheriff summary Court. The Scots legal system is unique in having
three possible verdicts for a criminal trial: "guilty", "not guilty" and ""not
proven"". Both "not guilty" and "not proven" result in an acquittal with no
possibility of retrial. Crime in England and Wales increased in the period
between 1981 and 1995, though since that peak there has been an overall fall of
48% in crime from 1995 to 2007/08, according to crime statistics. The prison
population of England and Wales has almost doubled over the same period, to
over 80,000, giving England and Wales the highest rate of incarceration in
Western Europe at 147 per 100,000. Her Majesty's Prison Service, which reports
to the Ministry of Justice, manages most of the prisons within England and
Wales. Crime in Scotland fell to its lowest recorded level for 32 years in
2009/10, falling by ten percent. At the same time Scotland's prison population,
at over 8,000, is at record levels and well above design capacity. The Scottish
Prison Service, which reports to the Cabinet Secretary for Justice, manages
Scotland's prisons. In 2006 a report by the Surveillance Studies Network found
that the UK had the highest level of mass surveillance among industrialised
western nations. Foreign relations. The United Kingdom is a permanent member of
the United Nations Security Council, a member of the Commonwealth of Nations,
G7, G8, G20, NATO, the OECD, the WTO, the Council of Europe, the OSCE, and is a
member state of the European Union. The UK has a "Special Relationship" with
the United States and a close partnership with FranceÂ â€“ the "Entente
cordiale"Â â€“ and shares nuclear weapons technology with both countries. The
UK is also closely allied with the Republic of Ireland; the two countries share
a Common Travel Area and many Irish citizens serve in the British Army. The UK
also shares a close alliance with Portugal, which dates back to the Treaty of
Windsor in 1386 and is the oldest alliance in the world still in force. Other
close allies include other European Union and NATO members, Commonwealth
nations, and Japan. Britain's global presence and influence is further
amplified through its trading relations, foreign investments, official
development assistance and armed forces. Military. "Her Majesty's Armed Forces"
also known as the "British Armed Forces" and sometimes as the "Armed Forces of
the Crown" are the armed forces of the United Kingdom. They encompass three
professional service branches, the Naval Service (including the Royal Navy,
Royal Marines and Royal Fleet Auxiliary), the British Army, and the Royal Air
Force. The forces are all managed by the Ministry of Defence and controlled by
the Defence Council, chaired by the Secretary of State for Defence. The
Commander-in-Chief of Her Majesty's Armed Forces is the British monarch, Queen
Elizabeth II, to whom members of the forces swear allegiance. Historically, the
British Armed Forces had played a key role in establishing the British Empire
as the dominant world power. Having seen action in a number of major wars
involving other world powers, such as the Seven Years' War, the Napoleonic
Wars, the Crimean War, World War I and World War II - repeatedly emerging
victorious allowed Britain to influence world events with its policies and
emerge as the world's leading military and economic power. Since the end of the
British Empire, the United Kingdom has nonetheless remained a great power and
the British Armed Forces are among the largest and most technologically
sophisticated armed forces in the world. Recent defence policy has a stated
assumption that "the most demanding operations" will be undertaken as part of a
coalition. Setting aside the intervention in Sierra Leone, UK military
operations in Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, Iraq and, most recently, Libya, have
followed this approach. The last war in which the British military fought alone
was the Falklands War of 1982, in which they were victorious. The Armed Forces
are charged with protecting the UK and its overseas territories, promoting the
UK's global security interests and supporting international peacekeeping
efforts. They are active and regular participants in NATO, including the Allied
Rapid Reaction Corps, as well as the Five Power Defence Arrangements, RIMPAC
and other worldwide coalition operations. Overseas garrisons and facilities are
maintained in Ascension Island, Belize, Brunei, Canada, Cyprus, Diego Garcia,
the Falkland Islands, Germany, Gibraltar, Kenya and Qatar. According to various
sources, including the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute and the
Ministry of Defence, the United Kingdom has the fourth-highest military
expenditure in the world. Total defence spending currently accounts for around
2.3%Â â€“ 2.6% of total national GDP. The Royal Navy is a prominent blue-water
navy, currently one of only three world wide, with the French Navy and the
United States Navy being the other two. As well as being responsible for
delivering the UKs Nuclear Deterrent via the UK Trident programme and four
Vanguard class submarines, the Royal Navy operates a large operational fleet of
ships, including an aircraft carrier, a helicopter carrier, landing platform
docks, nuclear fleet submarines, guided missile destroyers, frigates, mine-
countermeasure vessels and patrol vessels. In the near future two new aircraft
carriers, HMS "Queen Elizabeth" and HMS "Prince of Wales" will enter service in
the Royal Navy. The United Kingdom Special Forces, such as the Special Air
Service and Special Boat Service, provide troops trained for quick, mobile,
military responses in counter-terrorism, land, maritime and amphibious
operations, often where secrecy or covert tactics are required. Economy. The UK
has a partially regulated market economy. Based on market exchange rates the UK
is today the sixth-largest economy in the world and the third-largest in Europe
after Germany and France, having fallen behind France for the first time in
over a decade in 2008. HM Treasury, led by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, is
responsible for developing and executing the British government's public
finance policy and economic policy. The Bank of England is the UK's central
bank and is responsible for issuing the nation's currency, the pound sterling.
Banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland retain the right to issue their own
notes, subject to retaining enough Bank of England notes in reserve to cover
their issue. Pound sterling is the world's third-largest reserve currency
(after the U.S. Dollar and the Euro). Since 1997 the Bank of England's Monetary
Policy Committee, headed by the Governor of the Bank of England, has been
responsible for setting interest rates at the level necessary to achieve the
overall inflation target for the economy that is set by the Chancellor each
year. The UK service sector makes up around 73% of GDP. London is one of the
three "command centres" of the global economy (alongside New York City and
Tokyo), is the world's largest financial centre alongside New York, and has the
largest city GDP in Europe. Edinburgh is also one of the largest financial
centres in Europe. Tourism is very important to the British economy and, with
over 27Â million tourists arriving in 2004, the United Kingdom is ranked as the
sixth major tourist destination in the world and London has the most
international visitors of any city in the world. The creative industries
accounted for 7% GVA in 2005 and grew at an average of 6% per annum between
1997 and 2005. The Industrial Revolution started in the UK with an initial
concentration on the textile industry, followed by other heavy industries such
as shipbuilding, coal mining, and Steelmaking. The empire created an overseas
market for British products, allowing the UK to dominate international trade in
the 19th century. As other nations industrialised, coupled with economic
decline after two world wars, the United Kingdom began to lose its competitive
advantage and heavy industry declined, by degrees, throughout the 20th century.
Manufacturing remains a significant part of the economy but accounted for only
16.7% of national output in 2003. The automotive industry is a significant part
of the UK manufacturing sector and employs over 800,000 people, with a turnover
of some Â£52 billion, generating Â£26.6 billion of exports. The aerospace
industry of the UK is the second- or third-largest national aerospace industry
depending upon the method of measurement and has an annual turnover of around
Â£20 billion. The pharmaceutical industry plays an important role in the UK
economy and the country has the third highest share of global pharmaceutical
R&D expenditures (after the United States and Japan). In the final quarter of
2008 the UK economy officially entered recession for the first time since 1991.
Unemployment increased from 5.2% in May 2008 to 7.6% in May 2009 and by January
2012 the unemployment rate among 18 to 24-year-olds had risen from 11.9% to
22.5%, the highest since current records began in 1992. Total UK government
debt rose from 44.4% of GDP in 2007 to 82.9% of GDP in 2011. The poverty line
in the UK is commonly defined as being 60% of the median household income. In
2007â€“2008 13.5Â million people, or 22% of the population, lived below this
line. This is a higher level of relative poverty than all but four other EU
members. In the same year 4.0Â million children, 31% of the total, lived in
households below the poverty line after housing costs were taken into account.
This is a decrease of 400,000 children since 1998â€“1999. The UK imports 40% of
its food supplies. Science and technology. England and Scotland were leading
centres of the Scientific Revolution from the 17th century and the United
Kingdom led the Industrial Revolution from the 18th century, and has continued
to produce scientists and engineers credited with important advances. Major
theorists from the 17th and 18th centuries include Isaac Newton, whose laws of
motion and illumination of gravity have been seen as a keystone of modern
science, from the 19th century Charles Darwin, whose theory of evolution by
natural selection was fundamental to the development of modern biology, and
James Clerk Maxwell, who formulated classical electromagnetic theory, and more
recently Stephen Hawking, who has advanced major theories in the fields of
cosmology, quantum gravity and the investigation of black holes. Major
scientific discoveries from the 18th century include hydrogen by Henry
Cavendish, from the 20th century penicillin by Alexander Fleming, and the
structure of DNA, by Francis Crick and others. Major engineering projects and
applications by people from the UK in the 18th century include the steam
locomotive, developed by Richard Trevithick and Andrew Vivian, from the 19th
century the electric motor by Michael Faraday, the incandescent light bulb by
Joseph Swan, and the first practical telephone, patented by Alexander Graham
Bell, and in the 20th century the world's first working television system by
John Logie Baird and others, the jet engine by Frank Whittle, the basis of the
modern computer by Alan Turing, and the World Wide Web by Tim Berners-Lee.
Scientific research and development remains important in British universities,
with many establishing science parks to facilitate production and co-operation
with industry. Between 2004 and 2008 the UK produced 7% of the world's
scientific research papers and had an 8% share of scientific citations, the
third and second highest in the world (after the United States and China, and
the United States, respectively). Scientific journals produced in the UK
include "Nature", the "British Medical Journal" and "The Lancet". Transport. A
radial road network totals of main roads, of motorways and of paved roads. In
2009 there were a total of 34Â million licensed vehicles in Great Britain. The
National Rail network of 10,072 route miles (16,116Â km) in Great Britain and
189 route miles (303 route km) in Northern Ireland carries over 18,000
passenger and 1,000 freight trains daily. Plans are now being considered to
build new high-speed railway lines by 2025. In the year from October 2009 to
September 2010 UK airports handled a total of 211.4Â million passengers. In
that period the three largest airports were London Heathrow Airport
(65.6Â million passengers), Gatwick Airport (31.5Â million passengers) and
London Stansted Airport (18.9Â million passengers). London Heathrow Airport,
located west of the capital, has the most international passenger traffic of
any airport in the world and is the hub for the UK flag carrier British
Airways, as well as BMI and Virgin Atlantic. Energy. In 2006 the UK was the
world's ninth-largest consumer of energy and the 15th largest producer. In 2007
the UK had a total energy output of 9.5 quadrillion Btus, of which the
composition was oil (38%), natural gas (36%), coal (13%), nuclear (11%) and
other renewables (2%). In 2009 the UK produced 1.5Â million barrels per day
(bbl/d) of oil and consumed 1.7Â million bbl/d. Production is now in decline
and the UK has been a net importer of oil since 2005. the UK has around
3.1Â billion barrels of proven crude oil reserves, the largest of any EU member
state. In 2009 the UK was the 13th largest producer of natural gas in the world
and the largest producer in the EU. Production is now in decline and the UK has
been a net importer of natural gas since 2004. In 2009 the UK produced
19.7Â million tons of coal and consumed 60.2Â million tons. In 2005 it had
proven recoverable coal reserves of 171Â million tons. It has been estimated
that identified onshore areas have the potential to produce between 7Â billion
tonnes and 16Â billion tonnes of coal through underground coal gasification
(UCG). Based on current UK coal consumption, these volumes represent reserves
that could last the UK between 200 and 400 years. The UK is home to a number of
large energy companies, including two of the six oil and gas "supermajors"Â â€“
BP and Royal Dutch ShellÂ â€“ and BG Group. Demographics. A census is taken
simultaneously in all parts of the UK every ten years. The Office for National
Statistics is responsible for collecting data for England and Wales, the
General Register Office for Scotland and the Northern Ireland Statistics and
Research Agency each being responsible for censuses in their respective
countries. In the 2001 census the total population of the United Kingdom was
58,789,194, the third largest in the European Union, the fifth largest in the
Commonwealth and the twenty-first largest in the world. By mid-2010 this was
estimated to have grown to 62,262,000. 2010 was the third successive year in
which natural change contributed more to population growth than net long-term
international migration. Between 2001 and 2010 the population increased by an
average annual rate of 0.6 per cent. This compares to 0.3 per cent per year in
the period 1991 to 2001 and 0.2 per cent in the decade 1981 to 1991. The mid-
2007 population estimates revealed that, for the first time, the UK was home to
more people of pensionable age than children under the age of 16. It has been
estimated that the number of people aged 100 or over will rise steeply to reach
over 626,000 by 2080. England's population in mid-2010 was estimated to be
52.23Â million. It is one of the most densely populated countries in the world,
with 383Â people resident per square kilometre in mid-2003, with a particular
concentration in London and the south-east. The mid-2010 estimates put
Scotland's population at 5.22Â million, Wales at 3.01Â million and Northern
Ireland at 1.80Â million, with much lower population densities than England.
Compared to England's , the corresponding figures were for Wales, for Northern
Ireland and for Scotland in mid-2003. In percentage terms Northern Ireland has
had the fastest growing population of any country of the UK in each of the four
years to mid-2008. In 2009 the average total fertility rate (TFR) across the UK
was 1.94 children per woman. While a rising birth rate is contributing to
current population growth, it remains considerably below the 'baby boom' peak
of 2.95 children per woman in 1964, below the replacement rate of 2.1, but
higher than the 2001 record low of 1.63. In 2010, Scotland had the lowest TFR
at only 1.75, followed by Wales at 1.98, England at 2.00, and Northern Ireland
at 2.06. Ethnic groups. Historically, indigenous British people were thought to
be descended from the various ethnic groups that settled there before the 11th
century: the Celts, Romans, Anglo-Saxons, Norse and the Normans. Welsh people
could be the oldest ethnic group in the UK. Recent genetic studies have shown
that more than 50 percent of England's gene pool contains Germanic Y
chromosomes, though other recent genetic analysis indicates that "about 75 per
cent of the traceable ancestors of the modern British population had arrived in
the British isles by about 6,200 years ago, at the start of the British
Neolithic or Stone Age", and that the British broadly share a common ancestry
with the Basque people. The UK has a history of small-scale non-white
immigration, with Liverpool having the oldest Black population in the country
dating back to at least the 1730s, and the oldest Chinese community in Europe,
dating to the arrival of Chinese seamen in the 19th century. In 1950 there were
probably fewer than 20,000 non-white residents in Britain, almost all born
overseas. Since 1945 substantial immigration from Africa, the Caribbean and
South Asia has been a legacy of ties forged by the British Empire. Migration
from new EU member states in Central and Eastern Europe since 2004 has resulted
in growth in these population groups but, , the trend is reversing and many of
these migrants are returning home, leaving the size of these groups unknown. ,
92.1% of the population identified themselves as White, leaving 7.9% of the UK
population identifying themselves as mixed race or of an ethnic minority.
Ethnic diversity varies significantly across the UK. 30.4% of London's
population and 37.4% of Leicester's was estimated to be non-white , whereas
less than 5% of the populations of North East England, Wales and the South West
were from ethnic minorities according to the 2001 census. , 26.5% of primary
and 22.2% of secondary pupils at state schools in England are members of an
ethnic minority. In 2009, official estimates have shown that the non-white
British population of England and Wales has increased by 38% from 6.6 million
in 2001 to 9.1 million in 2009. The fastest growing group is the mixed-race
population that doubled from 672,000 in 2001 to 986,600 in 2009. Also in the
same period, a decrease of 36,000 white British people was recorded. Languages.
The UK's "de facto" official language is English (British English), a West
Germanic language descended from Old English which features a large number of
borrowings from Old Norse, Norman French, Greek and Latin. The English language
has spread across the world, initially because of the British Empire from the
17th to the mid-20th century, and subsequently due to the dominance of the
United States, and has become the main international language of business as
well as the most widely taught second language. There are four Celtic languages
in use in the UK: Welsh, Irish, Scottish Gaelic and Cornish. The first three
are recognised as regional or minority languages subject to specific measures
of protection and promotion under relevant European law, while Cornish is
recognised but not specifically protected. In the 2001 Census over a fifth
(21%) of the population of Wales said they could speak Welsh, an increase from
the 1991 Census (18%). In addition it is estimated that about 200,000 Welsh
speakers live in England. In the same census in Northern Ireland 167,487 people
(10.4%) stated that they had "some knowledge of Irish" (see Irish language in
Northern Ireland), almost exclusively in the nationalist (mainly Catholic)
population. Over 92,000 people in Scotland (just under 2% of the population)
had some Gaelic language ability, including 72% of those living in the Outer
Hebrides. The number of schoolchildren being taught through Welsh, Scottish
Gaelic and Irish is increasing. Among emigrant-descended populations some
Scottish Gaelic is still spoken in Canada (principally Nova Scotia and Cape
Breton Island), and Welsh in Patagonia, Argentina. Scots, a language descended
from early northern Middle English, has limited recognition alongside its
regional variant, Ulster Scots in Northern Ireland, without specific
commitments to protection and promotion. It is compulsory for pupils to study a
second language up to the age of 14 in England, and up to age 16 in Scotland.
French and German are the two most commonly taught second languages in England
and Scotland. In Wales, all pupils up to age 16 are taught Welsh as a second
language, or taught in Welsh. Religion. Forms of Christianity have dominated
religious life in what is now the United Kingdom for over 1,400 years. Although
a majority of citizens still identify with Christianity in many surveys,
regular church attendance has fallen dramatically since the middle of the 20th
century, while immigration and demographic change have contributed to the
growth of other faiths, most notably Islam. This has led some commentators to
variously describe the UK as a multi-faith, secularised, or post-Christian
society. In the 2001 census 71.6% of all respondents indicated that they were
Christians, with the next largest faiths (by number of adherents) being Islam
(2.8%), Hinduism (1.0%), Sikhism (0.6%), Judaism (0.5%), Buddhism (0.3%) and
all other religions (0.3%). 15% of respondents stated that they had no
religion, with a further 7% not stating a religious preference. A Tearfund
survey in 2007 showed only one in ten Britons actually attend church weekly.
The (Anglican) Church of England is the established church in England. It
retains a representation in the UK Parliament and the British monarch is its
Supreme Governor. In Scotland the Presbyterian Church of Scotland is recognised
as the national church. It is not subject to state control, and the British
monarch is an ordinary member, required to swear an oath to "maintain and
preserve the Protestant Religion and Presbyterian Church Government" upon his
or her accession. The (Anglican) Church in Wales was disestablished in 1920
and, as the (Anglican) Church of Ireland was disestablished in 1870 before the
partition of Ireland, there is no established church in Northern Ireland.
Although there are no UK-wide data in the 2001 census on adherence to
individual Christian denominations, Ceri Peach has estimated that 62% of
Christians are Anglican, 13.5% Roman Catholic, 6% Presbyterian, 3.4% Methodist
with small numbers of other Protestant denominations or Orthodox churches.
Migration. The United Kingdom has experienced successive waves of migration.
The Great Famine in Ireland resulted in a large population migrating to others
parts of the United Kingdom. Over 120,000 Polish veterans settled in Britain
after World War II, unable to return home. In the 20th century there was
significant immigration from the colonies and newly independent former
colonies, driven largely by post-World War II labour shortages. Many of these
migrants came from the Caribbean and the Indian subcontinent. In 2010, there
were 7.0 million foreign-born residents in the UK, corresponding to 11.3% of
the total population. Of these, 4.76 million (7.7%) were born outside the EU
and 2.24 million (3.6%) were born in another EU Member State. The proportion of
foreign-born people in the UK remains slightly below that of many other
European countries, although immigration is now contributing to a rising
population, with arrivals and UK-born children of migrants accounting for about
half of the population increase between 1991 and 2001. Analysis of Office for
National Statistics (ONS) data shows that a net total of 2.3Â million migrants
moved to the UK in the 15 years from 1991 to 2006. In 2008 it was predicted
that migration would add 7Â million to the UK population by 2031, though these
figures are disputed. The ONS reported that net migration rose from 2009 to
2010 by 21 percent to 239,000. In 2011 the net increase was 251,000:
immigration was 589,000, while the number of people emigrating (for more than
12 months) was 338,000. 195,046 foreign nationals became British citizens in
2010, compared to 54,902 in 1999. A record 241,192 people were granted
permanent settlement rights in 2010, of whom 51 per cent were from Asia and 27
per cent from Africa. 25.1 per cent of babies born in England and Wales in 2010
were born to mothers born outside the UK, according to official statistics
released in 2011. At least 5.5Â million British-born people are living abroad,
the top four destinations being Australia, Spain, the United States and Canada.
Emigration was an important feature of British society in the 19th century.
Between 1815 and 1930 around 11.4Â million people emigrated from Britain and
7.3Â million from Ireland. Estimates show that by the end of the 20th century
some 300Â million people of British and Irish descent were permanently settled
around the globe. Citizens of the European Union, including those of the UK,
have the right to live and work in any member state. The UK applied temporary
restrictions to citizens of Romania and Bulgaria which joined the EU in January
2007. Research conducted by the Migration Policy Institute for the Equality and
Human Rights Commission suggests that, between May 2004 and September 2009,
1.5Â million workers migrated from the new EU member states to the UK, two-
thirds of them Polish, but that many subsequently returned home, resulting in a
net increase in the number of nationals of the new member states in the UK of
some 700,000 over that period. The late-2000s recession in the UK reduced the
economic incentive for Poles to migrate to the UK, with the migration becoming
temporary and circular. In 2009, for the first time since enlargement, more
nationals of the eight central and eastern European states that had joined the
EU in 2004 left the UK than arrived. In 2011, citizens of the new EU member
states made up 13% of the immigrants entering the country. The UK government
has introduced a points-based immigration system for immigration from outside
the European Economic Area to replace former schemes, including the Scottish
Government's Fresh Talent Initiative. In June 2010 the Conservative-Liberal
Democrat coalition government introduced a temporary limit of 24,000 on
immigration from outside the EU, aiming to discourage applications before a
permanent cap was imposed in April 2011. The cap has caused tension within the
coalition: business secretary Vince Cable has argued that it is harming British
businesses. Education. Education in the United Kingdom is a devolved matter,
with each country having a separate education system. Education in England is
the responsibility of the Secretary of State for Education, though the day-to-
day administration and funding of state schools is the responsibility of local
authorities. Universally free of charge state education was introduced
piecemeal between 1870 and 1944, with education becoming compulsory for all 5
to 14 year-olds in 1921. Education is now mandatory from ages five to sixteen
(15 if born in late July or August). The majority of children are educated in
state-sector schools, only a small proportion of which select on the grounds of
academic ability. State schools which are allowed to select pupils according to
intelligence and academic ability can achieve comparable results to the most
selective private schools: out of the top ten performing schools in terms of
GCSE results in 2006 two were state-run grammar schools. Despite a fall in
actual numbers the proportion of children in England attending private schools
has risen to over 7%. Over half of students at the leading universities of
Cambridge and Oxford had attended state schools. The universities of England
include some of the top universities in the world; the University of Cambridge,
University College London, the University of Oxford and Imperial College London
are all ranked in the global top 10 in the 2010 QS World University Rankings,
with Cambridge ranked first. Trends in International Mathematics and Science
Study (TIMSS) rated pupils in England 7th in the world for maths and 6th for
science. The results put England's pupils ahead of other European countries,
including Germany and the Scandinavian countries. Education in Scotland is the
responsibility of the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning,
with day-to-day administration and funding of state schools the responsibility
of Local Authorities. Two non-departmental public bodies have key roles in
Scottish education: the Scottish Qualifications Authority is responsible for
the development, accreditation, assessment and certification of qualifications
other than degrees which are delivered at secondary schools, post-secondary
colleges of further education and other centres; and Learning and Teaching
Scotland provides advice, resources and staff development to the education
community to promote curriculum development and create a culture of innovation,
ambition and excellence. Scotland first legislated for compulsory education in
1496. The proportion of children in Scotland attending private schools is just
over 4%, although it has been rising slowly in recent years. Scottish students
who attend Scottish universities pay neither tuition fees nor graduate
endowment charges, as fees were abolished in 2001 and the graduate endowment
scheme was abolished in 2008. Education in Northern Ireland is the
responsibility of the Minister of Education and the Minister for Employment and
Learning, although responsibility at a local level is administered by five
education and library boards covering different geographical areas. The Council
for the Curriculum, Examinations & Assessment (CCEA) is the body responsible
for advising the government on what should be taught in Northern Ireland's
schools, monitoring standards and awarding qualifications. The Welsh Government
has responsibility for education in Wales. A significant number of Welsh
students are taught either wholly or largely in the Welsh language; lessons in
Welsh are compulsory for all until the age of 16. There are plans to increase
the provision of Welsh-medium schools as part of the policy of creating a fully
bilingual Wales. Healthcare. Healthcare in the United Kingdom is a devolved
matter and each country has its own system of private and publicly funded
health care, together with alternative, holistic and complementary treatments.
Public healthcare is provided to all UK permanent residents and is free at the
point of need, being paid for from general taxation. The World Health
Organization, in 2000, ranked the provision of healthcare in the United Kingdom
as fifteenth best in Europe and eighteenth in the world. Regulatory bodies are
organised on a UK-wide basis such as the General Medical Council, the Nursing
and Midwifery Council and non-governmental-based, such as the Royal Colleges.
However, political and operational responsibility for healthcare lies with four
national executives; healthcare in England is the responsibility of the UK
Government; healthcare in Northern Ireland is the responsibility of the
Northern Ireland Executive; healthcare in Scotland is the responsibility of the
Scottish Government; and healthcare in Wales is the responsibility of the Welsh
Assembly Government. Each National Health Service has different policies and
priorities, resulting in contrasts. Since 1979 expenditure on healthcare has
been increased significantly to bring it closer to the European Union average.
The UK spends around 8.4 per cent of its gross domestic product on healthcare,
which is 0.5 percentage points below the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development average and about one percentage point below the average of the
European Union. Culture. The culture of the United Kingdom has been influenced
by many factors including: the nation's island status; its history as a western
liberal democracy and a major power; as well as being a political union of four
countries with each preserving elements of distinctive traditions, customs and
symbolism. As a result of the British Empire, British influence can be observed
in the language, culture and legal systems of many of its former colonies;
including Australia, Canada, India, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa and the
United States. The substantial cultural influence of the United Kingdom has led
it to be described as a "cultural superpower." Literature. 'British literature'
refers to literature associated with the United Kingdom, the Isle of Man and
the Channel Islands. Most British literature is in the English language. In
2005, some 206,000 books were published in the United Kingdom and in 2006 it
was the largest publisher of books in the world. The English playwright and
poet William Shakespeare is widely regarded as the greatest dramatist of all
time, and his contemporaries Christopher Marlowe and Ben Jonson have also been
held in continuous high esteem. More recently the playwrights Alan Ayckbourn,
Harold Pinter, Michael Frayn, Tom Stoppard and David Edgar have combined
elements of surrealism, realism and radicalism. Notable pre-modern and early-
modern English writers include Geoffrey Chaucer (14th century), Thomas Malory
(15th century), Sir Thomas More (16th century), and John Milton (17th century).
In the 18th century Daniel Defoe (author of "Robinson Crusoe") and Samuel
Richardson were pioneers of the modern novel. In the 19th century there
followed further innovation by Jane Austen, the gothic novelist Mary Shelley,
children's writer Lewis Carroll, the BrontÃ« sisters, the social campaigner
Charles Dickens, the naturalist Thomas Hardy, the realist George Eliot, the
visionary poet William Blake and romantic poet William Wordsworth. 20th century
English writers include: science-fiction novelist H. G. Wells; the writers of
children's classics Rudyard Kipling, A. A. Milne (the creator of Winnie-the-
Pooh), Roald Dahl and Enid Blyton; the controversial D. H. Lawrence; modernist
Virginia Woolf; the satirist Evelyn Waugh; the prophetic novelist George
Orwell; the popular novelists W. Somerset Maugham and Graham Greene; the crime
writer Agatha Christie (the best-selling novelist of all time); Ian Fleming
(the creator of James Bond); the poets T. S. Eliot, Philip Larkin and Ted
Hughes; and the fantasy writers J. R. R. Tolkien, C. S. Lewis and J. K.
Rowling. Scotland's contributions include the detective writer Arthur Conan
Doyle (the creator of Sherlock Holmes), romantic literature by Sir Walter
Scott, children's writer J. M. Barrie, the epic adventures of Robert Louis
Stevenson and the celebrated poet Robert Burns. More recently the modernist and
nationalist Hugh MacDiarmid and Neil M. Gunn contributed to the Scottish
Renaissance. A more grim outlook is found in Ian Rankin's stories and the
psychological horror-comedy of Iain Banks. Scotland's capital, Edinburgh, was
UNESCO's first worldwide City of Literature. Britain's oldest known poem, "Y
Gododdin", was composed in "Yr Hen Ogledd" ("The Old North"), most likely in
the late 6th century. It was written in Cumbric or Old Welsh and contains the
earliest known reference to King Arthur. From around the seventh century, the
connection between Wales and the Old North was lost, and the focus of Welsh-
language culture shifted to Wales, where Arthurian legend was further developed
by Geoffrey of Monmouth. Wales's most celebrated medieval poet, Dafydd ap
Gwilym (fl 1320â€“1370), composed poetry on themes including nature, religion
and especially love. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest European
poets of his age. Until the late 19th century the majority of Welsh literature
was in Welsh and much of the prose was religious in character. Daniel Owen is
credited as the first Welsh-language novelist, publishing "Rhys Lewis" in 1885.
The best-known of the Anglo-Welsh poets are both Thomases. Dylan Thomas became
famous on both sides of the Atlantic in the mid-20th century. He is remembered
for his poetryÂ â€“ his "Do not go gentle into that good night; Rage, rage
against the dying of the light." is one of the most quoted couplets of English
language verseÂ â€“ and for his 'play for voices', "Under Milk Wood".
Influential Church in Wales 'poet-priest' and Welsh nationalist, R. S. Thomas,
was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1996. Leading Welsh
novelists of the twentieth century include Richard Llewellyn and Kate Roberts.
Authors of other nationalities, particularly from Commonwealth countries, the
Republic of Ireland and the United States, have lived and worked in the UK.
Significant examples through the centuries include Jonathan Swift, Oscar Wilde,
Bram Stoker, George Bernard Shaw, Joseph Conrad, T.S. Eliot, Ezra Pound and
more recently British authors born abroad such as Kazuo Ishiguro and Sir Salman
Rushdie. Music. Various styles of music are popular in the UK from the
indigenous folk music of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland to heavy
metal. Notable composers of classical music from the United Kingdom and the
countries that preceded it include William Byrd, Henry Purcell, Sir Edward
Elgar, Gustav Holst, Sir Arthur Sullivan (most famous for working with
librettist Sir W.S. Gilbert), Ralph Vaughan Williams and Benjamin Britten,
pioneer of modern British opera. Sir Peter Maxwell Davies is one of the
foremost living composers and current Master of the Queen's Music. The UK is
also home to world-renowned symphonic orchestras and choruses such as the BBC
Symphony Orchestra and the London Symphony Chorus. Notable conductors include
Sir Simon Rattle, John Barbirolli and Sir Malcolm Sargent. Some of the notable
film score composers include John Barry, Clint Mansell, Mike Oldfield, John
Powell, Craig Armstrong, David Arnold, John Murphy, Monty Norman and Harry
Gregson-Williams. George Frideric Handel, although born German, was a
naturalised British citizen and some of his best works, such as "Messiah", were
written in the English language. Andrew Lloyd Webber has achieved enormous
worldwide commercial success and is a prolific composer of musical theatre,
works which have dominated London's West End for a number of years and have
travelled to Broadway in New York. The Beatles have international sales of over
one billion units and are the biggest-selling and most influential band in the
history of popular music. Other prominent British contributors to have
influenced popular music over the last 50 years include; The Rolling Stones,
Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Queen, the Bee Gees, and Elton John, all of whom have
world wide record sales of 200Â million or more. The Brit Awards are the BPI's
annual music awards, and some of the British recipients of the Outstanding
Contribution to Music award include; The Who, David Bowie, Eric Clapton, Rod
Stewart and The Police. More recent UK music acts that have had international
success include Coldplay, Radiohead, Oasis, Muse, Spice Girls, Amy Winehouse
and Adele. A number of UK cities are known for their music. Acts from Liverpool
have had more UK chart number one hit singles per capita (54) than any other
city worldwide. Glasgow's contribution to music was recognised in 2008 when it
was named a UNESCO City of Music, one of only three cities in the world to have
this honour. Visual art. The history of British visual art forms part of
western art history. Major British artists include: the Romantics William
Blake, John Constable, Samuel Palmer and J.M.W. Turner; the portrait painters
Sir Joshua Reynolds and Lucian Freud; the landscape artists Thomas Gainsborough
and L. S. Lowry; the pioneer of the Arts and Crafts Movement William Morris;
the figurative painter Francis Bacon; the Pop artists Peter Blake, Richard
Hamilton and David Hockney; the collaborative duo Gilbert and George; the
abstract artist Howard Hodgkin; and the sculptors Antony Gormley, Anish Kapoor
and Henry Moore. During the late 1980s and 1990s the Saatchi Gallery in London
helped to bring to public attention a group of multi-genre artists who would
become known as the "Young British Artists": Damien Hirst, Chris Ofili, Rachel
Whiteread, Tracey Emin, Mark Wallinger, Steve McQueen, Sam Taylor-Wood and the
Chapman Brothers are among the better-known members of this loosely affiliated
movement. The Royal Academy in London is a key organisation for the promotion
of the visual arts in the United Kingdom. Major schools of art in the UK
include: the six-school University of the Arts London, which includes the
Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design and Chelsea College of Art and
Design; Goldsmiths, University of London; the Slade School of Fine Art (part of
University College London); the Glasgow School of Art; the Royal College of
Art; and The Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art (part of the University of
Oxford). The Courtauld Institute of Art is a leading centre for the teaching of
the history of art. Important art galleries in the United Kingdom include the
National Gallery, National Portrait Gallery, Tate Britain and Tate Modern (the
most-visited modern art gallery in the world, with around 4.7Â million visitors
per year). Cinema. The United Kingdom has had a considerable influence on the
history of the cinema. The British directors Alfred Hitchcock and David Lean
are among the most critically acclaimed of all-time, with other important
directors including Charlie Chaplin, Michael Powell, Carol Reed and Ridley
Scott. Many British actors have achieved international fame and critical
success, including: Julie Andrews, Richard Burton, Michael Caine, Charlie
Chaplin, Sean Connery, Vivien Leigh, David Niven, Laurence Olivier, Peter
Sellers and Kate Winslet. Some of the most commercially successful films of all
time have been produced in the United Kingdom, including the two highest-
grossing film franchises ("Harry Potter" and "James Bond"). Ealing Studios has
a claim to being the oldest continuously working film studio in the world.
Despite a history of important and successful productions, the industry has
often been characterised by a debate about its identity and the level of
American and European influence. Many British films are co-productions with
American producers, often using both British and American actors, and British
actors feature regularly in Hollywood films. Many successful Hollywood films
have been based on British people, stories or events, including "Titanic", "The
Lord of the Rings", "Pirates of the Caribbean", and the 'English Cycle' of
Disney animated films which include, "Alice in Wonderland", "Peter Pan" and
"Robin Hood". In 2009 British films grossed around $2Â billion worldwide and
achieved a market share of around 7% globally and 17% in the United Kingdom. UK
box-office takings totalled Â£944Â million in 2009, with around 173Â million
admissions. The British Film Institute has produced a poll ranking of what it
considers to be the 100 greatest British films of all time, the BFI Top 100
British films. The annual British Academy Film Awards, hosted by the British
Academy of Film and Television Arts, are the British equivalent of the Oscars.
Media. The BBC, founded in 1922, is the UK's publicly funded radio, television
and Internet broadcasting corporation, and is the oldest and largest
broadcaster in the world. It operates numerous television and radio stations in
the UK and abroad and its domestic services are funded by the television
licence. Other major players in the UK media include ITV plc, which operates 11
of the 15 regional television broadcasters that make up the ITV Network, and
News Corporation, which owns a number of national newspapers through News
International such as the most popular tabloid "The Sun" and the longest-
established daily "broadsheet" "The Times", as well as holding a large stake in
satellite broadcaster British Sky Broadcasting. London dominates the media
sector in the UK: national newspapers and television and radio are largely
based there, although Manchester is also a significant national media centre.
Edinburgh and Glasgow, and Cardiff, are important centres of newspaper and
broadcasting production in Scotland and Wales respectively. The UK publishing
sector, including books, directories and databases, journals, magazines and
business media, newspapers and news agencies, has a combined turnover of around
Â£20 billion and employs around 167,000 people. In 2009 it was estimated that
individuals viewed a mean of 3.75 hours of television per day and 2.81 hours of
radio. In that year the main BBC public service broadcasting channels accounted
for an estimated 28.4% of all television viewing; the three main independent
channels accounted for 29.5% and the increasingly important other satellite and
digital channels for the remaining 42.1%. Sales of newspapers have fallen since
the 1970s and in 2009 42% of people reported reading a daily national
newspaper. In 2010 82.5% of the UK population were Internet users, the highest
proportion amongst the 20 countries with the largest total number of users in
that year. Philosophy. The United Kingdom is famous for the tradition of
'British Empiricism', a branch of the philosophy of knowledge that states that
only knowledge verified by experience is valid, and 'Scottish Philosophy',
sometimes referred to as the 'Scottish School of Common Sense'. The most famous
philosophers of British Empiricism are John Locke, George Berkeley and David
Hume; while Dugald Stewart, Thomas Reid and William Hamilton were major
exponents of the Scottish "common sense" school. Two Britons are also notable
for a theory of moral philosophy utilitarianism, first used by Jeremy Bentham
and later by John Stuart Mill in his short work "Utilitarianism". Other eminent
philosophers from the UK and the unions and countries that preceded it include
Duns Scotus, John Lilburne, Mary Wollstonecraft, Sir Francis Bacon, Adam Smith,
Thomas Hobbes, William of Ockham, Bertrand Russell and A.J. "Freddie" Ayer.
Foreign-born philosophers who settled in the UK include Isaiah Berlin, Karl
Marx, Karl Popper and Ludwig Wittgenstein. Sport. Major sports, including
association football, rugby league, rugby union, rowing, boxing, badminton,
cricket, tennis, darts and golf, originated or were substantially developed in
the United Kingdom and the states that preceded it. A 2003 poll found that
football is the most popular sport in the United Kingdom. In most international
competitions, separate teams represent England, Scotland and Wales. Northern
Ireland and the Republic of Ireland usually field a single team representing
all of Ireland, with notable exceptions including at the Commonwealth Games and
association football. In sporting contexts, these teams can be referred to
collectively as the Home Nations. However there are occasions where a single
sports team represents the United Kingdom, including at the Olympics where the
UK is represented by the Great Britain team. London was the site of the 1908
and 1948 Olympic Games, and in 2012 became the first city to play host for a
third time. Each of the Home Nations has its own football association, national
team and league system, though a few clubs play outside their country's
respective systems for a variety of historical and logistical reasons. England,
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland compete as separate countries in
international competition and, as a consequence, Great Britain previously did
not compete as a team in football events at the Olympic Games. The Great
Britain Olympic football team was assembled to compete in the London 2012
Olympic Games by The Football Association. The Scottish, Welsh and Northern
Irish football associations declined to participate, fearing that it would
undermine their independent statusÂ â€“ a fear confirmed by FIFA president Sepp
Blatter. Cricket was invented in England. The England cricket team, controlled
by the England and Wales Cricket Board, is the only national team in the UK
with Test status. Team members are drawn from the main county sides, and
include both English and Welsh players. Cricket is distinct from football and
rugby where Wales and England field separate national teams, although Wales had
fielded its own team in the past. Irish and Scottish players have played for
England because neither Scotland nor Ireland have Test status and have only
recently started to play in One Day Internationals. Scotland, England (and
Wales), and Ireland (including Northern Ireland) have competed at the Cricket
World Cup, with England reaching the finals on three occasions. There is a
professional league championship in which clubs representing 17 English
counties and 1 Welsh county compete. Rugby league is a popular sport in some
areas of the UK. It originates in Huddersfield and is generally played in
Northern England. A single 'Great Britain Lions' team had competed in the Rugby
League World Cup and Test match games, but this changed in 2008 when England,
Scotland and Ireland competed as separate nations. Great Britain is still being
retained as the full national team for Ashes tours against Australia, New
Zealand and France. Super League is the highest level of professional rugby
league in the UK and Europe. It consists of 11 teams from Northern England, 1
from London, 1 from Wales and 1 from France. The Six Nations Championship,
played between the Home Nations, as well as Italy and France, is the premier
international rugby union tournament in the northern hemisphere. Sport
governing bodies in England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland organise and regulate
the game separately. Each nation has a top-ranked international team. Any of
the Home Nations to beat the other three in that tournament is awarded the
Triple Crown. The game of lawn tennis first originated in the city of
Birmingham between 1859 and 1865. The Championships, Wimbledon are
international tennis events held in Wimbledon in south London every summer and
are regarded as the most prestigious event of the global tennis calendar.
Snooker is one of the UK's popular sporting exports, with the world
championships held annually in Sheffield. In Northern Ireland Gaelic football
and hurling are popular team sports, both in terms of participation and
spectating, and Irish expatriates throughout the UK and the US also play them.
Shinty (or "camanachd") is popular in the Scottish Highlands. Thoroughbred
racing, which originated under Charles II of England as the "sport of kings",
is popular throughout the UK with world-famous races including the Grand
National, the Epsom Derby, Royal Ascot and the Cheltenham National Hunt
Festival (including the Cheltenham Gold Cup). The UK has proved successful in
the international sporting arena in rowing. Golf is the sixth most popular
sport, by participation, in the UK. Although The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of
St Andrews in Scotland is the sport's home course, the world's oldest golf
course is actually Musselburgh Links' Old Golf Course. The UK is closely
associated with motorsport. Many teams and drivers in Formula One (F1) are
based in the UK, and drivers from Britain have won more world titles than any
other country. The UK hosted the very first F1 Grand Prix in 1950 at
Silverstone, the current location of the British Grand Prix held each year in
July. The country also hosts legs of the World Rally Championship and has its
own touring car racing championship, the British Touring Car Championship
(BTCC). Symbols. The flag of the United Kingdom is the Union Flag (also
referred to as the Union Jack). It was first created in 1606 by the
superimposition of the Flag of England on the Flag of Scotland and updated in
1801 with the addition of Saint Patrick's Flag. Wales is not represented in the
Union Flag as Wales had been conquered and annexed to England prior to the
formation of the United Kingdom; the possibility of redesigning the Union Flag
to include representation of Wales has not been completely ruled out. The
national anthem of the United Kingdom is "God Save the King", with "King"
replaced with "Queen" in the lyrics whenever the monarch is a woman. Britannia
is a national personification of the United Kingdom, originating from Roman
Britain. Britannia is symbolised as a young woman with brown or golden hair
wearing a Corinthian helmet and white robes. She holds Poseidon's three-pronged
trident and a shield, bearing the Union Flag. Sometimes she is depicted as
riding on the back of a lion. At and since the height of the British Empire,
Britannia has often been associated with maritime dominance, as in the
patriotic song "Rule, Britannia!". Up until 2008, the lion symbol is depicted
behind Britannia on the British fifty pence coin and on the back of the British
ten pence coin. It is also used as a symbol on the non-ceremonial flag of the
British Army. The bulldog is sometimes used as a symbol of the United Kingdom
and has been associated with Winston Churchill's defiance of Nazi Germany.
