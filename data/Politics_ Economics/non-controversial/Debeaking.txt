Debeaking Debeaking, also called beak trimming is the partial removal of the
beak of poultry, especially layer hens and turkeys although it may also be
performed on quail and ducks. Most commonly, the beak is shortened permanently,
although regrowth can occur. The trimmed lower beak is somewhat longer than the
upper beak. USA's UEP guidelines suggest that in egg laying strains of
chickens, the length of the upper beak distal from the nostrils which remains
following trimming, should be 2 to 3Â mm. In the UK, the Farm Animal Welfare
Council stated ""The accepted procedure is to remove not more than one third of
the upper and lower beaks or not more than one third of the upper beak only""
but then went on to recommend ""Where beak trimming is carried out, it should,
wherever possible, be restricted to beak tipping; that is the blunting of the
beak to remove the sharp point which can be the cause of the most severe damage
to other birds."" The term "debeaking" implies that the entire beak is removed
during the trimming process, though in reality only half or less of the beak is
removed. Beak trimming is most common in egg-laying strains of chickens. In
some countries such as the United States, turkeys are routinely beak trimmed,
however, in the UK, only 10% of turkeys are beak trimmed. Beak trimming is a
preventive measure to reduce damage caused by injurious pecking such as
cannibalism, feather pecking and vent pecking, and thereby improve livability.
Commercial broiler chickens are not routinely beak trimmed as they reach
slaughter weight at approximately 6 weeks of age, i.e. before injurious pecking
usually begins. However, broiler breeding stock may be trimmed to prevent
damage during mating. In some countries, beak trimming is done as a last resort
where alternatives are considered not to be possible or appropriate. Beak
trimming has been banned in Switzerland since 1992. In close confinement,
cannibalism, feather pecking and aggression are common among turkeys, ducks,
pheasants, quail, and egg laying strains of chickens of many breeds (including
both heritage breeds and modern hybrids). The tendency to cannibalism and
feather pecking varies among different strains of chickens, but does not
manifest itself consistently. Some flocks of the same breed may be entirely
free from cannibalism, while others, under the same management, may have a
serious outbreak. Mortalities mainly due to cannibalism can be up to 15% in egg
laying flocks housed in aviaries, straw yards, and free-range systems. Because
egg laying strains of chickens can be kept in smaller group sizes in caged
systems, cannibalism is reduced leading to a lowered trend in mortality as
compared to non-cage systems. Cannibalism among flocks is highly variable and
when it is not problematic, then mortalities among production systems are
similar. History. Beak trimming was developed at the Ohio Experiment Station in
the 1930s. The original form was temporary, cutting approximately 1/4" off the
beak. It was thought that the tip of the beak had no blood supply and
presumably no sensation. The procedure was performed by hand with a sharp
knife, either when deaths due to cannibalism became excessive, or when the
problem was anticipated because of a history of cannibalism in the particular
strain of chicken. Jull, M.A., (1938). "Poultry Husbandry", 2nd Edition. McGraw
Hill, New York., page 346. Cannibalism has two peaks in the life of a chicken;
during the brooding period and at the onset of egg laying. The point-of-lay
cannibalism is generally the most damaging and gets most of the attention. The
temporary beak trimming developed at the Ohio Experiment Station assumed that
cannibalism was a phase, and that blunting the beak temporarily would be
adequate. Current methods (2011). In recent years, the aim has been to develop
more permanent beak trimming (although repeat trimming may be required), using
electrically heated blades in a beak trimming machine, to provide a self-
cauterizing cut. There are currently (2012) four widely used methods of beak
trimming: hot blade, cold blade (including scissors or secateurs), electrical
(the Bio-beaker) and infrared. The latter two methods usually remove only the
tip of the beak and do not leave an open wound, therefore they may offer
improvements in welfare. Other approaches such as the use of lasers, freeze
drying and chemical retardation have been investigated but are not in
widespread use. The infrared method directs a strong source of heat into the
inner tissue of the beak and after a few weeks, the tip of the upper and lower
beak dies and drops off making the beak shorter with blunt tips. The Bio-
beaker, which uses an electric current to burn a small hole in the upper beak,
is the preferred method for trimming the beaks of turkeys. The Farm Animal
Welfare Council (FAWC) wrote regarding beak trimming of turkeys that cold
cutting was the most accurate method, but that substantial re-growth of the
beak occurred; although the Bio-beaker limited beak re-growth, it was less
accurate; and that the hot cut was the most distressing procedure for the
turkeys. In the UK, beak trimming of layer hens normally occurs at 1-day of age
as the chick is being sexed and vaccinated. Costs and benefits of beak
trimming. Costs. The costs of beak trimming relate primarily to welfare
concerns. These include acute stress, and acute, possibly chronic, pain
following trimming. A birdâ€™s ability to consume feed is impaired following
beak trimming because of the new beak shape and pain. Most studies report
reduced body weights and feed intake following beak trimming, however, by
sexual maturity or peak egg production, growth rates are usually normal. Weight
losses were reduced in chicks that were beak trimmed by infrared compared with
chicks trimmed by a hot-blade. The pain of beak trimming. Whether beak trimming
causes pain is a hotly debated concern. It is a complex issue as it may involve
acute and/or chronic pain, and depends on the age it is performed, the method
of trimming and the length of beak that is removed. Beak trimming in the
poultry industry usually occurs without anaesthetic at 1-day of age or when the
chicks are very young, but can occur at a later age if an outbreak of feather
pecking occurs, and in some cases, birds may be beak trimmed on repeated
occasions. Acute pain. The beak is a complex, functional organ with an
extensive nervous supply including nociceptors that sense pain and noxious
stimuli. These would almost certainly be stimulated during beak trimming,
indicating strongly that acute pain would be experienced. Behavioural evidence
of pain after beak trimming in layer hen chicks has been based on the observed
reduction in pecking behavior, reduced activity and social behavior, and
increased sleep duration. In Japanese quail, beak-trimming by cauterization
caused lower body weights and feed intake in the period just after beak
trimming. Beak trimmed Muscovy ducks spent less time engaging in beak-related
behaviours (preening, feeding, drinking, exploratory pecking) and more time
resting than non-trimmed ducks in the days immediately post-trim. These
differences disappeared by 1 week post-trim. At 1 week post-trim the trimmed
ducks weighed less than non-trimmed ducks, but this difference disappeared by 2
weeks post-trim. It is, however, unclear if the above changes in behaviour
arise from pain or from a loss of sensitivity in the beak. Pecking force has
been found to decrease after beak trimming in adult hens possibly indicating
that hens are protecting a painful area from further stimulation. However,
pecking force did not differ between chicks with or without minor beak-trims at
2 to 9 days of age, suggesting that chicks with minor beak-trims do not
experience pain from the beak. Chronic pain. Severe beak trimming, or beak
trimming birds at an older age, may cause chronic pain. Following beak trimming
of older or adult hens, the nociceptors in the beak stump show abnormal
patterns of neural discharge, which indicate acute pain. Neuromas, tangled
masses of swollen regenerating axon sprouts, are found in the healed stumps of
birds beak trimmed at 5 weeks of age or older and in severely beak trimmed
birds. Neuromas have been associated with phantom pain in human amputees and
have therefore been linked to chronic pain in beak trimmed birds. If beak
trimming is severe because of improper procedure or done in older birds, the
neuromas will persist which suggests that beak trimmed older birds experience
chronic pain, although this has been debated. Benefits. The benefits of beak
trimming relate to welfare advantages, some of which directly relate to
increases (or reduced decreases) in production. These include reduced feather
pecking and cannibalism, better feather condition, less fearfulness and
nervousness, less chronic stress, and decreased mortality. Alternatives to beak
trimming. A range of options have been proposed as possible alternatives to
beak trimming including modifying the genetics of domesticated poultry to
reduce cannibalistic tendencies. For confined housing where light control is
possible, lowering light intensity so that birds cannot see each other as
easily reduces antagonistic encounters and aggressive behaviour. Enrichment
devices, introduced at an early age, as simple objects hung in a habitat can
reduce aggressive behavior. Dividing the population into smaller group sizes
reduces cannibalism. Proper body weight management that avoids underweight
pullets reduces the probability of underweight pullets with uterine prolapse
that leads to cloacal cannibalism.
