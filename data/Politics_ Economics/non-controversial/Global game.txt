Global game In economics and game theory, global games are games of incomplete
information where players receive possibly-correlated signals of the underlying
state of the world. Global games were originally defined by Carlsson and van
Damme (1993). The most important practical application of global games has been
the study of crises in financial markets such as bank runs, currency crises,
and bubbles. However, they have other relevant applications such as investments
with payoff complementarities, beauty contests, political riots and
revolutions, and any other economic situation which displays strategic
complementarity. Global games in models of currency crises. Stephen Morris and
Hyun Song Shin (1998) considered a stylized currency crises model, in which
traders observe the relevant fundamentals with small noise, and show that this
leads to the selection of a unique equilibrium. This result overturns the
result in models of complete information, which feature multiple equilibria.
One concern with the robustness of this result is that the introduction of a
theory of prices in global coordination games may reintroduce multiplicity of
equilibria (Atkeson, 2001). This concern was addressed in Angeletos and Werning
(2006) and Hellwig "et. al."(2006). They show that equilibrium multiplicity may
be restored by the existence of prices acting as an endogenous public signal,
provided that private information is sufficiently precise.
