Business cycle The term business cycle (or economic cycle) refers to economy-
wide fluctuations in production or economic activity over several months or
years. These fluctuations occur around a long-term growth trend, and typically
involve shifts over time between periods of relatively rapid economic growth
(an expansion or boom), and periods of relative stagnation or decline (a
contraction or recession). Business cycles are usually measured by considering
the growth rate of real gross domestic product. Despite being termed , these
fluctuations in economic activity do not follow a mechanical or predictable
periodic pattern. History. Theory. The first systematic exposition of periodic
economic crises, in opposition to the existing theory of economic equilibrium,
was the 1819 "Nouveaux Principes d'Ã©conomie politique" by Jean Charles
LÃ©onard de Sismondi. Prior to that point classical economics had either denied
the existence of business cycles, blamed them on external factors, notably war,
or only studied the long term. Sismondi found vindication in the Panic of 1825,
which was the first unarguably international economic crisis, occurring in
peacetime. Sismondi and his contemporary Robert Owen, who expressed similar but
less systematic thoughts in 1817 "Report to the Committee of the Association
for the Relief of the Manufacturing Poor," both identified the cause of
economic cycles as overproduction and underconsumption, caused in particular by
wealth inequality. They advocated government intervention and socialism,
respectively, as the solution. This work did not generate interest among
classical economists, though underconsumption theory developed as a heterodox
branch in economics until being systematized in Keynesian economics in the
1930s. Sismondi's theory of periodic crises was developed into a theory of
alternating "cycles" by Charles Dunoyer, and similar theories, showing signs of
influence by Sismondi, were developed by Johann Karl Rodbertus. Periodic crises
in capitalism formed the basis of the theory of Karl Marx, who further claimed
that these crises were increasing in severity and, on the basis of which, he
predicted a communist revolution. He devoted hundreds of pages of "Das Kapital"
to crises. Classification by periods. In 1860, French economist Clement Juglar
identified the presence of economic cycles 8 to 11 years long, although he was
cautious not to claim any rigid regularity. Later, Austrian economist Joseph
Schumpeter argued that a Juglar cycle has four stages: (i) expansion (increase
in production and prices, low interests rates); (ii) crisis (stock exchanges
crash and multiple bankruptcies of firms occur); (iii) recession (drops in
prices and in output, high interests rates); (iv) recovery (stocks recover
because of the fall in prices and incomes). In this model, recovery and
prosperity are associated with increases in productivity, consumer confidence,
aggregate demand, and prices. Interest in these different typologies of cycles
has waned since the development of modern macroeconomics, which gives little
support to the idea of regular periodic cycles. Occurrence. There were frequent
crises in Europe and America in the 19th and first half of the 20th century,
specifically the period 1815â€“1939. This period started from the end of the
Napoleonic wars in 1815, which was immediately followed by the Post-Napoleonic
depression in the United Kingdom (1815â€“30), and culminated in the Great
Depression of 1929â€“39, which led into World War II. See Financial crisis:
19th century for listing and details. The first of these crises not associated
with a war was the Panic of 1825. Business cycles in OECD countries after World
War II were generally more restrained than the earlier business cycles. This
was particularly true during the Golden Age of Capitalism (1945/50â€“1970s),
and the period 1945â€“2008 did not experience a global downturn until the Late-
2000s recession. Economic stabilization policy using fiscal policy and monetary
policy appeared to have dampened the worst excesses of business cycles, and
automatic stabilization due to the aspects of the government's budget also
helped mitigate the cycle even without conscious action by policy-makers. In
this period the economic cycle â€“ at least the problem of depressions â€“ was
twice declared dead. The first declaration was in the late 1960s, when the
Phillips curve was seen as being able to steer the economy. However, this was
followed by stagflation in the 1970s, which discredited the theory. The second
declaration was in the early 2000s, following the stability and growth in the
1980s and 1990s in what came to be known as The Great Moderation. Notably, in
2003, Robert Lucas, in his presidential address to the American Economic
Association, declared that the "central problem of depression-prevention been
solved, for all practical purposes." Unfortunately, this was followed by the
2008â€“2012 global recession. Various regions have experienced prolonged
depressions, most dramatically the economic crisis in former Eastern Bloc
countries following the end of the Soviet Union in 1991. For several of these
countries the period 1989â€“2010 has been an ongoing depression, with real
income still lower than in 1989. This has been attributed not to a cyclical
pattern, but to a mismanaged transition from command economies to market
economies. Identifying. In the United States, it is generally accepted that the
National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) is the final arbiter of the dates
of the peaks and troughs of the business cycle. An expansion is the period from
a trough to a peak, and a recession as the period from a peak to a trough. The
NBER identifies a recession as "a significant decline in economic activity
spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in
real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production". Spectral analysis of
business cycles. Recent research employing spectral analysis has confirmed the
presence of Kondratiev waves in the world GDP dynamics at an acceptable level
of statistical significance. Korotayev & Tsirel also detected shorter business
cycles, dating the Kuznets to about 17 years and calling it the third sub-
harmonic of the Kondratiev, meaning that there are three Kuznets cycles per
Kondratiev. Cycles or fluctuations? In recent years economic theory has moved
towards the study of economic fluctuation rather than a 'business cycle' â€“
though some economists use the phrase 'business cycle' as a convenient
shorthand. For Milton Friedman calling the business cycle a "cycle" is a
misnomer, because of its non-cyclical nature. Friedman believed that for the
most part, excluding very large supply shocks, business declines are more of a
monetary phenomenon. Business cycles are not merely fluctuations in aggregate
economic activity. The critical feature that distinguishes them from the
commercial convulsions of earlier centuries or from the seasonal and other
short term variations of our own age is that the fluctuations are widely
diffused over the economyâ€”its industry, its commercial dealings, and its
tangles of finance. The economy of the western world is a system of closely
interrelated parts. He who would understand business cycles must master the
workings of an economic system organized largely in a network of free
enterprises searching for profit. The problem of how business cycles come about
is therefore inseparable from the problem of how a capitalist economy
functions. Explanations. The explanation of fluctuations in aggregate economic
activity is one of the primary concerns of macroeconomics. The main framework
for explaining such fluctuations is Keynesian economics. In the Keynesian view,
business cycles reflect the possibility that the economy may reach short-run
equilibrium at levels below or above full employment. If the economy is
operating with less than full employment, i.e., with high unemployment,
Keynesian theory states that monetary policy and fiscal policy can have a
positive role to play in smoothing the fluctuations of the business cycle.
There are a number of alternative heterodox economic theories of business
cycles, largely associated with particular schools or theorists. There are also
some divisions and alternative theories within mainstream economics, notably
real business cycle theory and credit-based explanations such as debt deflation
and the financial instability hypothesis. Exogenous vs. endogenous. Within
mainstream economics, the debate over external (exogenous) versus internal
(endogenous) being the causes of the economic cycles, with the classical school
(now neo-classical) arguing for exogenous causes and the underconsumptionist
(now Keynesian) school arguing for endogenous causes. These may also broadly be
classed as "supply-side" and "demand-side" explanations: supply-side
explanations may be styled, following Say's law, as arguing that "supply
creates its own demand", while demand-side explanations argue that effective
demand may fall short of supply, yielding a recession or depression. This
debate has important policy consequences: proponents of exogenous causes of
crises such as neoclassicals largely argue for minimal government policy or
regulation (laissez faire), as absent these external shocks, the market
functions, while proponents of endogenous causes of crises such as Keynesians
largely argue for larger government policy and regulation, as absent
regulation, the market will move from crisis to crisis. This division is not
absolute â€“ some classicals (including Say) argued for government policy to
mitigate the damage of economic cycles, despite believing in external causes,
while Austrian School economists argue against government involvement as only
worsening crises, despite believing in internal causes. The view of the
economic cycle as caused exogenously dates to Say's law, and much debate on
endogeneity or exogeneity of causes of the economic cycle is framed in terms of
refuting or supporting Say's law; this is also referred to as the "general
glut" debate. Until the Keynesian revolution in mainstream economics in the
wake of the Great Depression, classical and neoclassical explanations
(exogenous causes) were the mainstream explanation of economic cycles;
following the Keynesian revolution, neoclassical macroeconomics was largely
rejected. There has been some resurgence of neoclassical approaches in the form
of real business cycle (RBC) theory. The debate between Keynesians and neo-
classical advocates was reawakened following the recession of 2007. Mainstream
economists working in the neoclassical tradition, as opposed to the Keynesian
tradition, have usually viewed the departures of the harmonic working of the
market economy as due to exogenous influences, such as the State or its
regulations, labor unions, business monopolies, or shocks due to technology or
natural causes. Contrarily, in the heterodox tradition of Jean Charles LÃ©onard
de Sismondi, Clement Juglar, and Marx the recurrent upturns and downturns of
the market system are an endogenous characteristic of it. The 19th century
school of Underconsumptionism also posited endogenous causes for the business
cycle, notably the paradox of thrift, and today this previously heterodox
school has entered the mainstream in the form of Keynesian economics via the
Keynesian revolution. Keynesian. According to Keynesian economics, fluctuations
in aggregate demand cause the economy to come to short run equilibrium at
levels that are different from the full employment rate of output. These
fluctuations express themselves as the observed business cycles. Keynesian
models do not necessarily imply periodic business cycles. However, simple
Keynesian models involving the interaction of the Keynesian multiplier and
accelerator give rise to cyclical responses to initial shocks. Paul Samuelson's
"oscillator model" is supposed to account for business cycles thanks to the
multiplier and the accelerator. The amplitude of the variations in economic
output depends on the level of the investment, for investment determines the
level of aggregate output (multiplier), and is determined by aggregate demand
(accelerator). In the Keynesian tradition, Richard Goodwin accounts for cycles
in output by the distribution of income between business profits and workers
wages. The fluctuations in wages are almost the same as in the level of
employment (wage cycle lags one period behind the employment cycle), for when
the economy is at high employment, workers are able to demand rises in wages,
whereas in periods of high unemployment, wages tend to fall. According to
Goodwin, when unemployment and business profits rise, the output rises. Credit/
debt cycle. One alternative theory is that the primary cause of economic cycles
is due to the credit cycle: the net expansion of credit (increase in private
credit, equivalently debt, as a percentage of GDP) yields economic expansions,
while the net contraction causes recessions, and if it persists, depressions.
In particular, the bursting of speculative bubbles is seen as the proximate
cause of depressions, and this theory places finance and banks at the center of
the business cycle. A primary theory in this vein is the debt deflation theory
of Irving Fisher, which he proposed to explain the Great Depression. A more
recent complementary theory is the Financial Instability Hypothesis of Hyman
Minsky, and the credit theory of economic cycles is often associated with Post-
Keynesian economics such as Steve Keen. Post-Keynesian economist Hyman Minsky
has proposed a explanation of cycles founded on fluctuations in credit,
interest rates and financial frailty, called the Financial Instability
Hypothesis. In an expansion period, interest rates are low and companies easily
borrow money from banks to invest. Banks are not reluctant to grant them loans,
because expanding economic activity allows business increasing cash flows and
therefore they will be able to easily pay back the loans. This process leads to
firms becoming excessively indebted, so that they stop investing, and the
economy goes into recession. While credit causes have not been a primary theory
of the economic cycle within the mainstream, they have gained occasional
mention, such as , cited approvingly by . Real business cycle theory. Within
mainstream economics, Keynesian views have been challenged by real business
cycle models in which fluctuations are due to technology shocks. This theory is
most associated with Finn E. Kydland and Edward C. Prescott, and more generally
the Chicago school of economics (freshwater economics). They consider that
economic crisis and fluctuations cannot stem from a monetary shock, only from
an external shock, such as an innovation. There were great increases in
productivity, industrial production and real per capita product throughout
period from 1870â€“1890 that included the Long Depression and two other
recessions. See:Long depression#Myth of the Long Depression There were also
significant increases in productivity in the years leading up to the Great
Depression. Both the Long and Great Depressions were characterized by
overcapacity and market saturation. Over the period since the Industrial
Revolution, technological progress has had a much larger effect on the economy
than any fluctuations in credit or debt, the primary exception being the Great
Depression, which caused a multi-year steep economic decline. The effect of
technological progress can be seen by the purchasing power of an average hour's
work, which has grown from $3 in 1900 to $22 in 1990, measured in 2010 dollars.
There were similar increases in real wages during the 19th century. See:

long cycles can be seen at: Kondratiev wave#Modern modifications of Kondratiev
theory Carlota Perez blames "financial capital" for excess speculation, which
she claims is likely to occur in the "frenzy" stage of a new technology, such
as the 1998â€“2000 computer, internet, dot.com mania and bust. Perez also says
excess speculation is likely to occur in the mature phase of a technological
age. RBC theory has been categorically rejected by a number of mainstream
economists in the Keynesian tradition, such as and Paul Krugman. Politically-
based business cycle. Another set of models tries to derive the business cycle
from political decisions. The "partisan business cycle" suggests that cycles
result from the successive elections of administrations with different policy
regimes. Regime A adopts expansionary policies, resulting in growth and
inflation, but is voted out of office when inflation becomes unacceptably high.
The replacement, Regime B, adopts contractionary policies reducing inflation
and growth, and the downwards swing of the cycle. It is voted out of office
when unemployment is too high, being replaced by Party A. The political
business cycle is an alternative theory stating that when an administration of
any hue is elected, it initially adopts a contractionary policy to reduce
inflation and gain a reputation for economic competence. It then adopts an
expansionary policy in the lead up to the next election, hoping to achieve
simultaneously low inflation and unemployment on election day.Â Â  â€¢ William
D. Nordhaus, 1989:2. "Alternative Approaches to the Political Business Cycle,"
"Brookings Papers on Economic Activity", p p. 1-68. The political business
cycle theory is strongly linked to the name of MichaÅ‚ Kalecki who discussed
"the reluctance of the 'captains of industry' to accept government intervention
in the matter of employment." Persistent full employment would mean increasing
workers' bargaining power to raise wages and to avoid doing unpaid labor,
potentially hurting profitability. (He did not see this theory as applying
under fascism, which would use direct force to destroy labor's power.) In
recent years, proponents of the "electoral business cycle" theory have argued
that incumbent politicians encourage prosperity before elections in order to
ensure re-electionâ€”and make the citizens pay for it with recessions
afterwards. Marxian economics. For Marx the economy based on production of
commodities to be sold in the market is intrinsically prone to crisis. In the
heterodox Marxian view profit is the major engine of the market economy, but
business (capital) profitability has a tendency to fall that recurrently
creates crises, in which mass unemployment occurs, businesses fail, remaining
capital is centralized and concentrated and profitability is recovered. In the
long run these crises tend to be more severe and the system will eventually
fail. Some Marxist authors such as Rosa Luxemburg viewed the lack of purchasing
power of workers as a cause of a tendency of supply to be larger than demand,
creating crisis, in a model that has similarities with the Keynesian one.
Indeed a number of modern authors have tried to combine Marx's and Keynes's
views. Henryk Grossman reviewed the debates and the counteracting tendencies
and Paul Mattick subsequently emphasized the basic differences between the
Marxian and the Keynesian perspective: while Keynes saw capitalism as a system
worth maintaining and susceptible to efficient regulation, Marx viewed
capitalism as a historically doomed system that cannot be put under societal
control. The American mathematician and economist, Richard M. Goodwin
formalised a Marxist model of business cycles, known as the Goodwin Model in
which recession was caused by increased bargaining power of workers (a result
of high employment in boom periods) pushing up the wage share of national
income, suppressing profits and leading to a breakdown in capital accumulation.
Later theorists applying variants of the Goodwin model have identified both
short and long period profit-led growth and distribution cycles in the United
States, and elsewhere. David Gordon provided a marxist model of long period
institutional growth cycles, in an attempt to explain the Kondratiev wave. This
cycle is due to the periodic breakdown of the 'social structure of
accumulation'- a set of institutions which secure and stabilise capital
accumulation. Austrian School. Economists of the heterodox Austrian School
argue that business cycles are primarily caused by excessive creation of bank
credit â€“ or "fiduciary media" â€“ which is encouraged by central banks when
they set interest rates too low, especially when combined with the practice of
fractional reserve banking. The expansion of the money supply causes a "boom"
in which resources are misallocated due to falsified interest rate signals,
which then leads to the "bust" as the market self-corrects, the malinvestments
are liquidated, and the money supply contracts. One of the primary criticisms
of Austrian business cycle theory is the observation that the United States
suffered recurrent economic crises in the 19th century, most notably the Panic
of 1873, prior to the establishment of a U.S. central bank in 1913. Adherents,
such as the historian Thomas Woods argue that these earlier financial crises
were prompted by government and bankers' efforts to expand credit despite
restraints imposed by the prevailing gold standard, and are thus consistent
with Austrian Business Cycle Theory. Georgism. Henry George identifies land
price fluctuations as the primary cause of most business cycles. The theory is
generally ignored in most of today's discussions of the subject despite the
fact that the two great economic contractions of the last 100 years
(1929â€“1933 and 2008â€“2009) both involved speculative real estate bubbles.
George observed that one of the factors that is absolutely necessary for all
production â€” land â€” has an inherent tendency to rise in price on an
exponential basis as the economy grows. The reason for this is that the
quantity of land (the stock of locations and natural resources) is fixed, while
its quality is improved due to improvements such as transportation
infrastructures and economic development of the surroundings. Investors see
this tendency as the economy grows and they buy land ahead of the boom areas,
withholding it from use in order to take advantage of its increased value in
the future. Because housing and commercial real estate provide collateral for a
large portion of lending, there is a tendency for real estate prices to rise
faster than the rate of inflation in business cycle upswings. Speculation in
land concentrates profits in landholders and diverts economic resources to
speculation in land, squeezing profits away from production that has to occur
on this land. In effect, land speculation creates a built-in supply shock, that
squeezes the economy just as economic output increases. This is a systemic
retardation of the economy, placing a sharp brake on further economic
expansion. This shock to the economy occurs as long as there is land
speculation, creating an underlying tendency toward inflation and recession
late in the growth phase of the business cycle. Land speculation, according to
George, is always the cause of economic downturns. There are any number of
contributing causes; things like oil price shocks, consumer confidence crises,
international trade fluctuations, natural disasters â€” but none of these
things creates the underlying weakness. Land speculation slows the economy in
two ways. It increases production costs by making land in general more
expensive (shifting the AS curve upward) as well as decreasing productivity by
denying access to the best locations, shifting the AS curve to the left and
lowering "potential output". The Wisconsin Business School publishes an on line
database with building cost and land values for 46 U.S. metro areas. Mitigating
an economic downturn. Most social indicators (mental health, crimes, suicides)
worsen during economic recessions. As periods of economic stagnation are
painful for the many who lose their jobs, there is often political pressure for
governments to mitigate recessions. Since the 1940s, following the Keynesian
revolution, most governments of developed nations have seen the mitigation of
the business cycle as part of the responsibility of government, under the
rubric of stabilization policy. Since in the Keynesian view, recessions are
caused by inadequate aggregate demand, when a recession occurs the government
should increase the amount of aggregate demand and bring the economy back into
equilibrium. This the government can do in two ways, firstly by increasing the
money supply (expansionary monetary policy) and secondly by increasing
government spending or cutting taxes (expansionary fiscal policy). By contrast,
some economists, notably New classical economist Robert Lucas, argue that the
welfare cost of business cycles are very small to negligible, and that
governments should focus on long-term growth instead of stabilization. However,
even according to Keynesian theory, managing economic policy to smooth out the
cycle is a difficult task in a society with a complex economy. Some theorists,
notably those who believe in Marxian economics, believe that this difficulty is
insurmountable. Karl Marx claimed that recurrent business cycle crises were an
inevitable result of the operations of the capitalistic system. In this view,
all that the government can do is to change the "timing" of economic crises.
The crisis could also show up in a different "form", for example as severe
inflation or a steadily increasing government deficit. Worse, by delaying a
crisis, government policy is seen as making it "more dramatic" and thus more
painful. Additionally, since the 1960s neoclassical economists have played down
the ability of Keynesian policies to manage an economy. Since the 1960s,
economists like Nobel Laureates Milton Friedman and Edmund Phelps have made
ground in their arguments that inflationary expectations negate the Phillips
curve in the long run. The stagflation of the 1970s provided striking support
for their theories, defying the simple Keynesian prediction that recessions and
inflation cannot occur together. Friedman has gone so far as to argue that all
the central bank of a country should do is to avoid making large mistakes, as
he believes they did by contracting the money supply very rapidly in the face
of the Wall Street Crash of 1929, in which they made what would have been a
recession into the Great Depression. Notes. 1 The Pure Monitory theory 2 The
