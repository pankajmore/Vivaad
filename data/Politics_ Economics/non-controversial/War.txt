War War is an organized, armed, and, often, a prolonged conflict that is
carried on between states, nations, or other parties typified by extreme
aggression, social disruption, and usually high mortality. War should be
understood as an actual, intentional and widespread armed conflict between
political communities, and therefore is defined as a form of political
violence. The set of techniques used by a group to carry out war is known as
warfare. An absence of war (and other violence) is usually called peace. In
2003, Nobel Laureate Richard E. Smalley identified war as the sixth (of ten)
biggest problem facing the society of mankind for the next fifty years. In the
1832 treatise "On War", Prussian military general and theoretician Carl von
Clausewitz defined war as follows: "War is thus an act of force to compel our
enemy to do our will." While some scholars see warfare as an inescapable and
integral aspect of human culture, others argue that it is only inevitable under
certain socio-cultural or ecological circumstances. Some scholars argue that
the practice of war is not linked to any single type of political organization
or society. Rather, as discussed by John Keegan in his "History of Warfare",
war is a universal phenomenon whose form and scope is defined by the society
that wages it. Another argument suggests that since there are human societies
in which warfare does not exist, humans may not be naturally disposed for
warfare, which emerges under particular circumstances. The ever changing
technologies and potentials of war extend along a historical continuum. At the
one end lies the endemic warfare of the Paleolithic with its stones and clubs,
and the naturally limited loss of life associated with the use of such weapons.
Found at the other end of this continuum is nuclear warfare, along with the
recently developed possible outcome of its use, namely the potential risk of
the complete extinction of the human species. Etymology. The English word "war"
derives from the late Old English (c.1050) words "wyrre" and "werre"; the Old
North French "werre"; the Frankish "werra"; and the Proto-Germanic "werso". The
denotation of "war" derives from the Old Saxon "werran", Old High German
"werran", and the German "verwirren": ‚Äúto confuse‚Äù, ‚Äúto perplex‚Äù, and
‚Äúto bring into confusion‚Äù. Another posited derivation is from the Ancient
Greek "barbaros", the Old Persian "varhara", and the Sanskrit "varvar" and
"barbara". In German, the equivalent is "Krieg"; the equivalent Spanish,
Portuguese, and Italian words for "war" is "guerra", derived from the Germanic
"werra" (‚Äúfight‚Äù, ‚Äútumult‚Äù). Etymologic legend has it that the Romanic
peoples adopted a foreign, Germanic word for "war", to avoid using the Latin
"bellum", because, when sounded, it tended to merge with the sound of the word
"bello" ("beautiful") History of warfare. Before the dawn of civilization, war
likely consisted of small-scale raiding. One half of the people found in a
Nubian cemetery dating to as early as 12,000 years ago had died of violence.
Since the rise of the state some 5,000 years ago, military activity has
occurred over much of the globe. The advent of gunpowder and the acceleration
of technological advances led to modern warfare. According to Conway W.
Henderson, "One source claims 14,500 wars have taken place between 3500 BC and
the late 20th century, costing 3.5 billion lives, leaving only 300 years of
peace (Beer 1981: 20)." In "War Before Civilization", Lawrence H. Keeley, a
professor at the University of Illinois, says that approximately 90‚Äì95% of
known societies throughout history engaged in at least occasional warfare, and
many fought constantly. Keeley explained several styles of primitive combat
such as, small raids, large raids, and massacres. All of these forms of warfare
were perpetrated by primitive societies. The use of the massacre by pre-state
societies can be exhibited by the Dogrib tribes of the subarctic in North
America. The Dogrib tribe eventually destroyed the Yellowknife tribe by killing
4 men, 13 women, and 17 children which accounted for 20 percent of the
population. This was a devastating blow from which the Yellowknife tribe never
recovered. Keeley further explains how small raids are not organized due to the
lack of leadership and any formal training. This causes raids to be short and
quick with relatively low numerical casualties but may significantly damage a
percentage of a population. The deficit of resources also can account for a
lack of fortifications and defensive structures in primitive prestate
societies. The protection provided by a defensive could not justify the
valuable resources used and labor implemented to build it. William Rubinstein
wrote that "Pre-literate societies, even those organised in a relatively
advanced way, were renowned for their studied cruelty ... 'archaeology yields
evidence of prehistoric massacres more severe than any recounted in ethnography
after the coming of the Europeans'. At Crow Creek, South Dakota, as noted,
archaeologists found a mass grave of 'more than 500 men, women, and children
who had been slaughtered, scalped, and mutilated during an attack on their
village a century and a half before Columbus's arrival (ca. AD 1325)' ". In
Western Europe, since the late 18th century, more than 150 conflicts and about
600 battles have taken place. The Human Security Report 2005 documented a
significant decline in the number and severity of armed conflicts since the end
of the Cold War in the early 1990s. However, the evidence examined in the 2008
edition of the Center for International Development and Conflict Management's
"Peace and Conflict" study indicated that the overall decline in conflicts had
stalled. Recent rapid increases in the technologies of war, and therefore in
its destructiveness (see Mutual assured destruction), have caused widespread
public concern, and have in all probability forestalled, and may hopefully
altogether prevent the outbreak of a nuclear World War III. At the end of each
of the last two World Wars, concerted and popular efforts were made to come to
a greater understanding of the underlying dynamics of war and to thereby
hopefully reduce or even eliminate it all together. These efforts materialized
in the forms of the League of Nations, and its successor, the United Nations.
Shortly after World War II, as a token of support for this concept, most
nations joined the United Nations. During this same post-war period, with the
aim of further delegitimizing war as an acceptable and logical extension of
foreign policy, most national governments also renamed their Ministries or
Departments of War as their Ministries or Departments of Defense, for example,
the former US Department of War was renamed as the US Department of Defense. In
1947, in view of the rapidly increasingly destructive consequences of modern
warfare, and with a particular concern for the consequences and costs of the
newly developed atom bomb, Albert Einstein famously stated, "I know not with
what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with
sticks and stones." Fortunately, the anticipated costs of a possible third
world war are currently no longer deemed as acceptable by most, thus little
motivation currently seems to exist on an international level for such a war.
Still since the close of World War II, limited non-nuclear conflicts continue,
and surprisingly enough, some outspoken celebrities and politicians have even
advocated for the proclamation of another world war. Mao Zedong urged the
socialist camp not to fear nuclear war with the United States since, even if
"half of mankind died, the other half would remain while imperialism would be
razed to the ground and the whole world would become socialist." File:Greek-

costly wars, in terms of loss of life, have been waged in the last century.
These are of course the two World Wars, then followed by the Second Sino-
Japanese War (which is sometimes considered part of World War II, or
overlapping with that war). Most of the others involved China or neighboring
peoples. The death toll of World War II, being 60 million plus, surpasses all
other war-death-tolls by a factor of two. This may be due to significant recent
advances in weapons technologies, as well as recent increases in the overall
human population. Types of warfare. War, to become known as one, must entail
some degree of confrontation using weapons and other military technology and
equipment by armed forces employing military tactics and operational art within
the broad military strategy subject to military logistics. War Studies by
military theorists throughout military history have sought to identify the
philosophy of war, and to reduce it to a military science. In general, modern
military science considers several factors before a National defence policy is
created to allow a war to commence: the environment in the area(s) of combat
operations, the posture national forces will adopt on the commencement of a
war, and the type of warfare troops will be engaged in. Conventional warfare is
an attempt to reduce an opponent's military capability through open battle. It
is a declared war between existing states in which nuclear, biological, or
chemical weapons are not used or only see limited deployment in support of
conventional military goals and maneuvers. The opposite of conventional
warfare, unconventional warfare, is an attempt to achieve military victory
through acquiescence, capitulation, or clandestine support for one side of an
existing conflict. Nuclear warfare is warfare in which nuclear weapons are the
primary, or a major, method of coercing the capitulation of the other side, as
opposed to a supporting tactical or strategic role in a conventional conflict.
Civil war is a war where the forces in conflict belong to the same nation or
political entity and are vying for control of or independence from that nation
or political entity. Asymmetric warfare is a conflict between two populations
of drastically different levels of military capability or size. Asymmetric
conflicts often result in guerrilla tactics being used to overcome the
sometimes vast gaps in technology and force size. Intentional air pollution in
combat is one of a collection of techniques collectively called chemical
warfare. Poison gas as a chemical weapon was principally used during World War
I, and resulted in an estimated 91,198 deaths and 1,205,655 injuries. Various
treaties have sought to ban its further use. Non-lethal chemical weapons, such
as tear gas and pepper spray, are widely used, sometimes with deadly effect.
Warfare environment. The environment in which a war is fought has a significant
impact on the type of combat which takes place, and can include within its area
different types of terrain. This, in turn, means that soldiers have to be
trained to fight in a specific types of environments and terrains that
generally reflects troops' mobility and limitations. Behaviour and conduct in
war. The behaviour of troops in warfare varies considerably, both individually
and as units or armies. In some circumstances, troops may engage in genocide,
war rape and ethnic cleansing. Commonly, however, the conduct of troops may be
limited to posturing and sham attacks, leading to highly rule-bound and often
largely symbolic combat in which casualties are much reduced from that which
would be expected if soldiers were genuinely violent towards the enemy.
Situations of deliberate dampening of hostilities occurred in World War I by
some accounts, e.g., a volley of gunfire being exchanged after a misplaced
mortar hit the British line, after which a German soldier shouted an apology to
British forces, effectively stopping a hostile exchange of gunfire. Other
examples of non-aggression, also from World War I, are detailed in "Good-Bye to
All That." These include spontaneous ceasefires to rebuild defences and
retrieve casualties, alongside behaviour such as refusing to shoot at enemy
during ablutions and the taking of great risks (described as 1 in 20) to
retrieve enemy wounded from the battlefield. The most notable spontaneous
ceasefire of World War I was the Christmas truce. The psychological separation
between combatants, and the destructive power of modern weaponry, may act to
override this effect and facilitate participation by combatants in the mass
slaughter of combatants or civilians, such as in the bombing of Dresden in
World War II. The unusual circumstances of warfare can incite apparently normal
individuals to commit atrocities. Effects of war. [[File:War world map - DALY -
WHO2004.svg|thumb|200px|Disability-adjusted life year for war per
100,000¬ inhabitants in 2004. On soldiers. Soldiers subject to combat in war
often suffer psychological and physical casualties, including depression, Post
Traumatic Stress Disorder, disease, injury, and death. During World War II,
research conducted by US Army Brigadier General S.L.A. Marshall found that, on
average, only 15% to 20% of American riflemen in WWII combat fired at the
enemy. In Civil War Collector‚Äôs Encyclopedia, F.A. Lord notes that of the
27,574 discarded muskets found on the Gettysburg battlefield, nearly 90% were
loaded, with 12,000 loaded more than once and 6,000 loaded 3 to 10 times. These
studies suggest that most soldiers resist firing their weapons in combat, that
‚Äì as some theorists argue ‚Äì human beings have an inherent resistance to
killing their fellow human beings. Swank and Marchand‚Äôs WWII study found that
after sixty days of continuous combat, 98% of all surviving soldiers will
become psychiatric casualties. Psychiatric casualties manifest themselves in
fatigue cases, confusional states, conversion hysteria, anxiety, obsessional
and compulsive states, and character disorders. Additionally, it has been
estimated that anywhere from 18% to 54% of Vietnam war veterans suffered from
Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Based on 1860 census figures, 8% of all white
American males aged 13 to 43 died in the American Civil War, including about 6%
in the North and approximately 18% in the South. The war remains the deadliest
conflict in American history, resulting in the deaths of 620,000 soldiers.
United States military casualties of war since 1775 have totaled over two
million. Of the 60 million European soldiers who were mobilized in World War I,
8 million were killed, 7 million were permanently disabled, and 15 million were
seriously injured. During Napoleon's retreat from Moscow, more French soldiers
died of typhus than were killed by the Russians. Felix Markham thinks that
450,000 crossed the Neman on 25 June 1812, of whom less than 40,000 recrossed
in anything like a recognizable military formation. More soldiers were killed
from 1500‚Äì1914 by typhus than from all military action during that time
combined. In addition, if it were not for the modern medical advances there
would be thousands of more dead from disease and infection. For instance,
during the Seven Years' War, the Royal Navy reported that it conscripted
184,899 sailors, of whom 133,708 died of disease or were 'missing'. It is
estimated that 378,000 people died due to war each year between 1985 and 1994.
On civilians. Many wars have been accompanied by significant depopulations,
along with destruction of infrastructure and resources (which may lead to
famine, disease, and death in the civilian population). Civilians in war zones
may also be subject to war atrocities such as genocide, while survivors may
suffer the psychological aftereffects of witnessing the destruction of war.
During the Thirty Years' War in Europe, for example, the population of the
German states was reduced by about 30%. The Swedish armies alone may have
destroyed up to 2,000 castles, 18,000 villages and 1,500 towns in Germany, one-
third of all German towns. Estimates for the total casualties of World War II
vary, but most suggest that some 60 million people died in the war, comprising
around 20 million soldiers and 40 million civilians. The Soviet Union lost
around 27 million people during the war, about half of all World War II
casualties. Since a high proportion of those killed were young men, the postwar
Soviet population was 45 to 50 million fewer than post‚Äì1939 projections would
have led one to expect. The largest number of civilian deaths in a single city
was 1.2 million citizens dead during the 872-day Siege of Leningrad. On the
economy. Once a war has ended, losing nations are sometimes required to pay war
reparations to the victorious nations. In certain cases, land is ceded to the
victorious nations. For example, the territory of Alsace-Lorraine has been
traded between France and Germany on three different occasions. Typically
speaking, war becomes very intertwined with the economy and many wars are
partially or entirely based on economic reasons such as the American Civil War.
In some cases war has stimulated a country's economy (World War II is often
credited with bringing America out of the Great Depression) but in many cases,
such as the wars of Louis XIV, the Franco-Prussian War, and World War I,
warfare serves only to damage the economy of the countries involved. For
example, Russia's involvement in World War I took such a toll on the Russian
economy that it almost collapsed and greatly contributed to the start of the
Russian Revolution of 1917. World War II. One of the starkest illustrations of
the effect of war upon economies is the Second World War. The Great Depression
of the 1930s ended as nations increased their production of war materials to
serve the war effort. The financial cost of World War II is estimated at about
a trillion U.S. dollars worldwide, making it the most costly war in capital as
well as lives. By the end of the war, the European economy had collapsed with
70% of the industrial infrastructure destroyed. Property damage in the Soviet
Union inflicted by the Axis invasion was estimated to a value of 679 billion
rubles. The combined damage consisted of complete or partial destruction of
1,710 cities and towns, 70,000 villages/hamlets, 2,508 church buildings, 31,850
industrial establishments, 40,000 miles of railroad, 4100 railroad stations,
40,000 hospitals, 84,000 schools, and 43,000 public libraries. Factors ending a
war. The political and economic circumstances, in the peace that follows war,
usually depend on the facts on the ground. Where evenly matched adversaries
decide that the conflict has resulted in a stalemate, they may cease
hostilities to avoid further loss of life and property. They may decide to
restore the antebellum territorial boundaries, redraw boundaries at the line of
military control, or negotiate to keep or exchange captured territory.
Negotiations between parties involved at the end of a war often result in a
treaty, such as the Treaty of Versailles of 1919, which ended the First World
War. A warring party that surrenders or capitulates may have little negotiating
power, with the victorious side either imposing a settlement or dictating most
of the terms of any treaty. A common result is that conquered territory is
brought under the dominion of the stronger military power. An unconditional
surrender is made in the face of overwhelming military force as an attempt to
prevent further harm to life and property. For example, the Empire of Japan
gave an unconditional surrender to the Allies of World War II after the atomic
bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki (see Surrender of Japan), the preceding
massive strategic bombardment of Japan and declaration of war and the immediate
invasion of Manchuria by the Soviet Union. A settlement or surrender may also
be obtained through deception or bluffing. Many other wars, however, have ended
in complete destruction of the opposing territory, such as the Battle of
Carthage of the Third Punic War between the Phoenician city of Carthage and
Ancient Rome in 149 BC. In 146 BC the Romans burned the city, enslaved its
citizens, and razed the buildings. Some wars or aggressive actions end when the
military objective of the victorious side has been achieved. Others do not,
especially in cases where the state structures do not exist, or have collapsed
prior to the victory of the conqueror. In such cases, disorganised guerilla
warfare may continue for a considerable period. In cases of complete surrender
conquered territories may be brought under the permanent dominion of the
victorious side. A raid for the purposes of looting may be completed with the
successful capture of goods. In other cases an aggressor may decide to end
hostilities to avoid continued losses and cease hostilities without obtaining
the original objective, such as happened in the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. Some
hostilities, such as insurgency or civil war, may persist for long periods of
time with only a low level of military activity. In some cases there is no
negotiation of any official treaty, but fighting may trail off and eventually
stop after the political demands of the belligerent groups have been
reconciled, a political settlement has been negotiated, the combatants are
gradually killed or decide the conflict is futile, or the belligerents cease
active military engagement but still threaten each other. An example is the
Chinese Civil War which essentially ceased by 1950 but the People's Republic of
China fought diplomatically to isolate Taiwan, but it still threatens Republic
of China (commonly known as Taiwan) with an invasion. For this reason, some
historians consider the war not ended but continuing. List of ongoing wars.
Conflicts in the following list are currently causing at least 1,000 violent
deaths per year, a categorization used by the Uppsala Conflict Data Program and
recognised by the United Nations. The UN also use the term "low intensity
conflict," which can overlap with the 1,000 violent deaths per year
categorisation. Efforts to stop wars. Anti-war movements have existed for every
major war in the 20th century, including, most prominently, World War I, World
War II, and the Vietnam War. In the 21st century, worldwide anti-war movements
occurred ever since the United States declared wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. In
2001, the US government decided to invade Afghanistan to fight against
international terrorism that caused the September 11 attacks. Protests opposing
the War in Afghanistan occurred in cities in Europe, Asia, and all over the
United States. Organizations like Stop the War Coalition, based in the United
Kingdom, work on campaigning against the War. They raise awareness of the war,
organize demonstrations, and lobby the governments. There also exist
significant worldwide opposition to the Iraq War. Critics oppose the war based
on the argument of violation of sovereignty, absence of the UN approval, and
perceived illegitimacy. The Mexican Drug War, with estimated casualties of
40,000 since December 2006, has been recently facing a fundamental opposition.
In 2011, the movement for peace and justice has started a popular middle-class
movement against the war. It has won the recognition of President Calderon, who
started the war, but has not ended it. Governments also use the method of
disarmament to stop and prevent the cost of war. Theories for motivation. There
is no scholarly agreement on which are the most common motivations for war.
Motivations may be different for those ordering the war than for those
undertaking the war. For example, in the Third Punic War, Rome's leaders may
have wished to make war with Carthage for the purpose of eliminating a
resurgent rival, while the individual soldiers may have been motivated by a
wish to make money. Since many people are involved, a war may acquire a life of
its own from the confluence of many different motivations. An interpretation of
the ancient Jewish commentary (BeReshit Rabbah) on the fight between Cain and
Abel in Genesis 4 (Parashot BeReshit XXII:7) states that there are three
universal reasons for wars: A) Economics, B) Power, and C) Religion. In "Why
Nations Go to War", by John G. Stoessinger, the author points out that both
sides will claim that morality justifies their fight. He also states that the
rationale for beginning a war depends on an overly optimistic assessment of the
outcome of hostilities (casualties and costs), and on misperceptions of the
enemy's intentions. As the strategic and tactical aspects of warfare are always
changing, theories and doctrines relating to warfare are often reformulated
before, during, and after every major war. Carl Von Clausewitz said, 'Every age
had its own kind of war, its own limiting conditions, and its own peculiar
preconceptions.' The one constant factor is war‚Äôs employment of organized
violence and the resultant destruction of property and/ or lives that
necessarily follows. Psychoanalytic psychology. Dutch psychoanalyst Joost
Meerloo held that, "War is often...a mass discharge of accumulated internal
rage (where)...the inner fears of mankind are discharged in mass destruction."
Thus war can sometimes be a means by which man's own frustration at his
inability to master his own self is expressed and temporarily relieved via his
unleashing of destructive behavior upon "others." In this destructive scenario,
these "others" are made to serve as the scapegoat of man's own unspoken and
subconscious frustrations and fears. Other psychoanalysts such as E.F.M. Durban
and John Bowlby have argued that human beings are inherently violent. This
aggressiveness is fueled by displacement and projection where a person
transfers his or her grievances into bias and hatred against other races,
religions, nations or ideologies. By this theory, the nation state preserves
order in the local society while creating an outlet for aggression through
warfare. If war is innate to human nature, as is presupposed and predetermined
by many psychological theories, then there is little hope of ever escaping it.
The Italian psychoanalyst Franco Fornari, a follower of Melanie Klein, thought
that war was the paranoid or projective ‚Äúelaboration‚Äù of mourning. Fornari
thought that war and violence develop out of our ‚Äúlove need‚Äù: our wish to
preserve and defend the sacred object to which we are attached, namely our
early mother and our fusion with her. For the adult, nations are the sacred
objects that generate warfare. Fornari focused upon sacrifice as the essence of
war: the astonishing willingness of human beings to die for their country, to
give over their bodies to their nation. Despite Fornari's theory that man's
altruistic desire for self-sacrifice for a noble cause is a contributing factor
towards war, in history only a tiny fraction of wars have originated from a
desire for war from the general populace. Far more often the general population
has been reluctantly drawn into war by its rulers. One psychological theory
that looks at the leaders is advanced by Maurice Walsh. He argues that the
general populace is more neutral towards war and that wars only occur when
leaders with a psychologically abnormal disregard for human life are placed
into power. War is caused by leaders that seek war such as Napoleon and Hitler.
Such leaders most often come to power in times of crisis when the populace opts
for a decisive leader, who then leads the nation to war. Evolutionary. Several
theories concern the evolutionary origins of warfare. There are two main
schools: One sees organized warfare as emerging only in the mesolithic, as a
result of the emergence of complex social organization, higher population
density and political organization and competition over resources. The other
school tends to see human warfare simply as an extension of animal behavior,
such as territoriality and sexual competition. This school argues that since
organized warlike behavior patterns are also found in many other primate
species such as chimpanzees, as well as in many ant species, this suggests that
between group conflict is a general feature of animal social behavior.
Biologists studying primate behavior have added to the debate, documenting
warlike activities among several primate species and seeing similarities to
humans. Others argue that while war may be a natural phenomenon, the
development of technology and complex social organization has accelerated the
scale of warfare to exceptional levels among modern humans, starting at some
point in the mesolithic, and escalating with the development of weaponry and
large-scale state formations. One line of evidence for violent conflict among
the ancestors of humans is sexual dimorphism. In species that have high levels
of male competition over females, males tend to be larger and stronger than
females. Humans have considerable sexual dimorphism, although lower than our
nearest primate relatives. The strength difference is greater for upper-body
strength than for lower-body strength. Men are in general terms also larger,
faster, and more aggressive. Their skeleton, especially in the vulnerable face,
is more robust. This suggests that male competition has been an important
factor in human evolution. Steven Pinker in his book "The Blank Slate" argues
that raiding or warfare between groups of humans in the ancestral environment
was often beneficial for the victors. This includes gaining control over scarce
resources as well as the women of the defeated or raided group. Various
features of modern warfare such as alliances between groups and preemptive wars
were likely part of these conflicts. In order to have a credible deterrence
against other groups (as well as on an individual level), it was important to
have a reputation for retaliation, causing humans to develop instincts for
revenge as well as for protecting a group's (or an individual's) reputation
("honor"). Pinker argues that the development of the state and the police have
dramatically reduced the level of warfare and violence compared to the
ancestral environment. Whenever the state breaks down, which can be very
locally such as in poor areas of a city, humans again organize in groups for
protection and aggression and concepts such as violent revenge and protecting
honor again become extremely important. Ashley Montagu strongly denied
universalistic instinctual arguments, arguing that social factors and childhood
socialization are important in determining the nature and presence of warfare.
Thus, he argues, while human aggression may be a universal occurrence, warfare
is not, and would appear to have been a historical invention, associated with
certain types of human societies. This argument has been supported by
ethnographic research conducted in societies where the concept of aggression
seems to be entirely absent, e.g., the Chewong of the Malay peninsula. Crofoot
and Wrangham have instead argued that warfare, if defined as group interactions
in which "coalitions attempt to aggressively dominate or kill members of other
groups", is a characteristic of most human societies. Those in which it has
been lacking "tend to be societies that were politically dominated by their
neighbors". Economic. War can be seen as a growth of economic competition in a
competitive international system. In this view wars begin as a pursuit of
markets for natural resources and for wealth. While this theory has been
applied to many conflicts, such counter arguments become less valid as the
increasing mobility of capital and information level the distributions of
wealth worldwide, or when considering that it is relative, not absolute, wealth
differences that may fuel wars. There are those on the extreme right of the
political spectrum who provide support, fascists in particular, by asserting a
natural right of a strong nation to whatever the weak cannot hold by force.
Some centrist, capitalist, world leaders, including Presidents of the United
States and US Generals, expressed support for an economic view of war. Marxist.
The Marxist theory of war is quasi-economic in that it states that all modern
wars are caused by competition for resources and markets between great
(imperialist) powers, claiming these wars are a natural result of the free
market and class system. Part of the theory is that war will only disappear
once a world revolution, over-throwing free markets and class systems, has
occurred. Marxist philosopher Rosa Luxembourg theorized that imperialism was
the result of capitalist countries needing new markets. Expansion of the means
of production is only possible if there is a corresponding growth in consumer
demand. Since the workers in a capitalist economy would be unable to fill the
demand, producers must expand into non-capitalist markets to find consumers for
their goods, hence driving imperialism. Demographic. Demographic theories can
be grouped into two classes, Malthusian theories and youth bulge theories.
Malthusian. Malthusian theories see expanding population and scarce resources
as a source of violent conflict. This is one of the earliest expressions of
what has come to be called the Malthusian theory of war, in which wars are
caused by expanding populations and limited resources. Thomas Malthus
(1766‚Äì1834) wrote that populations always increase until they are limited by
war, disease, or famine. This theory is thought by Malthusians to account for
the relative decrease in wars during the past fifty years, especially in the
developed world, where advances in agriculture have made it possible to support
a much larger population than was formerly the case, and where birth control
has dramatically slowed the increase in population. Youth bulge. Youth bulge
theory differs significantly from Malthusian theories. Its adherents see a
combination of large male youth cohorts ‚Äì as graphically represented as a
"youth bulge" in a population pyramid ‚Äì with a lack of regular, peaceful
employment opportunities as a risk pool for violence. While Malthusian theories
focus on a disparity between a growing population and available natural
resources, youth bulge theory focuses on a disparity between non-inheriting,
'excess' young males and available social positions within the existing social
system of division of labour. Youth Bulge theories represent a relatively
recent development but seem to have become more influential in guiding U.S.
foreign policy and military strategy as both Goldstone and Fuller have acted as
consultants to the U.S. Government. CIA Inspector General John L. Helgerson
referred to youth bulge theory in his 2002 report "The National Security
Implications of Global Demographic Change". According to Heinsohn, who has
proposed youth bulge theory in its most generalized form, a youth bulge occurs
when 30 to 40 percent of the males of a nation belong to the "fighting age"
cohorts from 15 to 29 years of age. It will follow periods with total fertility
rates as high as 4‚Äì8 children per woman with a 15‚Äì29-year delay. A total
fertility rate of 2.1 children born by a woman during her lifetime represents a
situation of in which the son will replace the father, and the daughter will
replace the mother accounting for a small proportion of deaths to factors such
as illness and accidents. Thus, a total fertility rate of 2.1 represents
replacement level, while anything below represents a sub-replacement fertility
rate leading to population decline. Total fertility rates above 2.1 will lead
to population growth and to a youth bulge. A total fertility rate of 4‚Äì8
children per mother implies 2‚Äì4 sons per mother. Consequently, one father has
to leave not 1, but 2 to 4 social positions (jobs) to give all his sons a
perspective for life, which is usually hard to achieve. Since respectable
positions cannot be increased at the same speed as food, textbooks and
vaccines, many "angry young men" find themselves in a situation that tends to
escalate their adolescent anger into violence: they are Religions and
ideologies are seen as secondary factors that are being used to legitimate
violence, but will not lead to violence by themselves if no youth bulge is
present. Consequently, youth bulge theorists see both past "Christianist"
European colonialism and imperialism and today's "Islamist" civil unrest and
terrorism as results of high birth rates producing youth bulges. Among
prominent historical events that have been linked to the existence of youth
bulges is the role played by the historically large youth cohorts in the
rebellion and revolution waves of early modern Europe, including French
Revolution of 1789, and the importance of economic depression hitting the
largest German youth cohorts ever in explaining the rise of Nazism in Germany
in the 1930s. The 1994 Rwandan Genocide has also been analyzed as following a
massive youth bulge. While the implications of population growth have been
known since the completion of the National Security Study Memorandum 200 in
1974, neither the U.S. nor the WHO have implemented the recommended measures to
control population growth to avert the terrorist threat. Prominent demographer
Stephen D. Mumford attributes this to the influence of the Catholic Church.
Youth Bulge theory has been subjected to statistical analysis by the World
Bank, and the Berlin Institute for Population and Development. Statistic data
about historical development of demographic and economic parameters over the
last 200 years for each country can be visualized at Gapminder. Youth bulge
theories have been criticized as leading to racial, gender and age
"discrimination". Rationalist. Rationalist theories of war assume that both
sides to a potential war are rational, which is to say that each side wants to
get the best possible outcome for itself for the least possible loss of life
and property to its own side. Given this assumption, if both countries knew in
advance how the war would turn out, it would be better for both of them to just
accept the post-war outcome without having to actually pay the costs of
fighting the war. This is based on the notion, generally agreed to by almost
all scholars of war since Carl von Clausewitz, that wars are reciprocal, that
all wars require both a decision to attack and also a decision to resist
attack. Rationalist theory offers three reasons why some countries cannot find
a bargain and instead resort to war: issue indivisibility, information
asymmetry with incentive to deceive, and the inability to make credible
commitments. Issue indivisibility occurs when the two parties cannot avoid war
by bargaining because the thing over which they are fighting cannot be shared
between them, only owned entirely by one side or the other. Religious issues,
such as control over the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, are more likely to be
indivisible than economic issues. A bigger branch of the theory, advanced by
scholars of international relations such as Geoffrey Blainey, is that both
sides decide to go to war and one side may have miscalculated. Some go further
and say that there is a problem of information asymmetry with incentives to
misrepresent. The two countries may not agree on who would win a war between
them, or whether victory would be overwhelming or merely eked out, because each
side has military secrets about its own capabilities. They will not avoid the
bargaining failure by sharing their secrets, since they cannot trust each other
not to lie and exaggerate their strength to extract more concessions. For
example, Sweden made efforts to deceive Nazi Germany that it would resist an
attack fiercely, partly by playing on the myth of Aryan superiority and by
making sure that Hermann G√∂ring only saw elite troops in action, often dressed
up as regular soldiers, when he came to visit. The American decision to enter
the Vietnam War was made with the full knowledge that the communist forces
would resist them, but did not believe that the guerrillas had the capability
to long oppose American forces. Thirdly, bargaining may fail due to the states'
inability to make credible commitments. In this scenario, the two countries
might be able to come to a bargain that would avert war if they could stick to
it, but the benefits of the bargain will make one side more powerful and lead
it to demand even more in the future, so that the weaker side has an incentive
to make a stand now. Rationalist explanations of war can be critiqued on a
number of grounds. The assumptions of cost-benefit calculations become dubious
in the most extreme genocidal cases of World War II, where the only bargain
offered in some cases was infinitely bad. Rationalist theories typically assume
that the state acts as a unitary individual, doing what is best for the state
as a whole; this is problematic when, for example, the country's leader is
beholden to a very small number of people, as in a personalistic dictatorship.
Rationalist theory also assumes that the actors are rational, able to
accurately assess their likelihood of success or failure, but the proponents of
the psychological theories above would disagree. Rationalist theories are
usually explicated with game theory, for example, the Peace War Game, not a
wargame as such, rather a simulation of economic decisions underlying war.
Political science. The statistical analysis of war was pioneered by Lewis Fry
Richardson following World War I. More recent databases of wars and armed
conflict have been assembled by the Correlates of War Project, Peter Brecke and
the Uppsala Conflict Data Program. There are several different international
relations theory schools. Supporters of realism in international relations
argue that the motivation of states is the quest for security. Which sometimes
is argued to contradict the realist view, that there is much empirical evidence
to support the claim that states that are democracies do not go to war with
each other, an idea that has come to be known as the democratic peace theory.
Other factors included are difference in moral and religious beliefs,
economical and trade disagreements, declaring independence, and others. Another
major theory relating to power in international relations and "machtpolitik" is
the Power Transition theory, which distributes the world into a hierarchy and
explains major wars as part of a cycle of hegemons being destabilized by a
great power which does not support the hegemons' control. Military adventurism
can sometimes be used by political leaders as a means of boosting their
domestic popularity, as has been recorded in US war-time presidential
popularity surveys taken during the presidencies of several recent US leaders.
War ethics. The seeming contradiction between warfare and morality has led to
serious moral questions, which have been the subject of debate for thousands of
years. The debate, generally speaking, has two main viewpoints: Pacifists, who
believe that war is inherently immoral and therefore is never justified
regardless of circumstances, and those who believe that war is sometimes
necessary and can be moral. There are two different aspects to ethics in war,
according to the most prominent and influential thought on justice and war: The
Just War Theory. First is Jus ad bellum (literally translated as "right to
war"), which dictates which unfriendly acts and circumstances justify a proper
authority in declaring war on another nation. There are six main criteria for
the declaration of a just war: first, any just war must be declared by a lawful
authority; second, it must be a just and righteous cause, with sufficient
gravity to merit large-scale violence; third, the just belligerent must have
rightful intentions ‚Äì namely, that they seek to advance good and curtail
evil; fourth, a just belligerent must have a reasonable chance of success;
fifth, the war must be a last resort; and sixth, the ends being sought must be
proportional to means being used. Once a just war has been declared, the second
standard, or aspect, is put into effect. Jus in bello, which literally
translates to "right in war", are the ethical rules of conduct when conducting
war. The two main principles in "jus in bello" are proportionality and
discrimination. Proportionality regards how much force is necessary and morally
appropriate to the ends being sought and the injustice suffered. The principle
of Discrimination determines who are the legitimate targets in a war, and
specifically makes a separation between combatants, who it is permissible to
kill, and non-combatants, who it is not. Failure to follow these rules can
result in the loss of legitimacy for the just war belligerent, and so thereby
forfeit the moral right and justice of their cause. The Just War standard is as
old as Western Civilization itself, and still has significant impact on
thinking about the morality of wars and violence today. Just War Theory was
foundational in the creation of the United Nations and in International Law's
regulations on legitimate war. These two positions generally cover the broad
philosophical and ethical bents mainstream society. However, there are several
theories on and about War which are in the minority in culture, but which,
because of the influence they have had in recent history, demand mention here.
These strains of thought on human society and war can be broken up into two
main camps: Marxist and Fascist, both of which view war as purely practical.
Marxism, and other such historicist ideals, hold that history advances through
a set of dialectics (as stated by Heinrich Moritz Chalyb√§us: thesis,
antithesis, synthesis). Marx, and his followers, in particular held that
history advances through violence. Marxism-Leninism, in fact, held the belief
that outright incitement to violence and war was necessary to topple Capitalism
and free the proletariat. In these theories, the question of ethics has no
place, as the value of the war is entirely dependent on whether it advances the
revolution or synthesis. Fascism, and the ideals it encompasses, such as
Pragmatism, Racism, and Social Darwinism, hold that violence is good.
Pragmatism holds that war and violence can be good if it serves the ends of the
people, without regard for universal morality. Racism holds that violence is
good so that a master race can be established, or to purge an inferior race
from the earth, or both. Social Darwinism thinks that violence is sometimes
necessary to weed the unfit from society so that civilization can flourish.
These are broad archetypes for the general position that the ends justify the
means.
