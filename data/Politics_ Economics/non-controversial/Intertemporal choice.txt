Intertemporal choice Intertemporal choice is the study of the relative value
people assign to two or more payoffs at different points in time. Most choices
require decision-makers to trade-off costs and benefits at different points in
time. These decisions may be about savings, work effort, education, nutrition,
exercise, health care and so forth. For nearly 80 years, economists have
analyzed intertemporal decisions using the discounted utility (DU) model, which
assumes that people evaluate the pleasures and pains resulting from a decision
in much the same way that financial markets evaluate losses and gains,
exponentially ‚Äòdiscounting‚Äô the value of outcomes according to how delayed
they are in time. DU has been used to describe how people actually make
intertemporal choices and it has been used as a tool for public policy. Policy
decisions about how much to spend on research and development, health and
education all depend on the discount rate used to analyze the decision. The
Keynesian consumption function was based on two major hypothesis. Firstly,
marginal propensity to consume lies between 0 and 1. Secondly, average
propensity to consume falls as income rises. The early empirical studies were
consistent with these hypothesis. However, after the World War II it was
observed that savings did not rise as incomes rose. The Keynesian model
therefore, failed to explain the consumption phenomenon and thus emerged the
theory of Intertemporal Choice. Intertemporal choice was introduced by John Rae
in 1834 in the "Sociological Theory of Capital".Later, Eugen von B√∂hm-Bawerk
in 1889 and Irving Fisher in 1930 elaborated on the model. A few other models
based on intertemporal choice include the Life Cycle Income Hypothesis proposed
by Modigiliani and the Permanent Income Hypothesis proposed by Friedman. The
concept of Walrasian Equilibrium maybe also be extended to incorporate
intertemporal choice. The Walrasian analysis of such an equilibrium introduces
two "new" concepts of prices: futures prices and spot prices. Fisher's Model of
Intertemporal Consumption. Irving Fisher developed the theory of Intertemporal
Choice in his book "Theory of interest" (1930). Contrary to Keynes, who related
consumption to current income, Fisher‚Äôs model showed how rational forward
looking consumers chooses consumption for the present and future to maximize
their lifetime satisfaction. According to Fisher, an individual's impatience
depends on four characteristics of his income stream: the size, the time shape,
the composition and risk. Besides this foresight, self-control, habit,
expectation of life, and bequest motive (or concern for lives of others) are
the five personal factors that determine a person's impatience which in turn
determines his time preference. In order to understand the choice exercised by
a consumer across different periods of time we take consumption in one period
as a composite commodity. Suppose there is one consumer, formula_1 commodities,
and two periods. Preferences are given by formula_2 where formula_3. Income in
period formula_4 is formula_5. Savings in period 1 is formula_6, spending in
period formula_4 is formula_8, and formula_9 is the interest rate.
formula_10¬ ¬ ¬ ¬ (1) formula_11¬ ¬ ¬ ¬  (2) We arrive at the following
equation from equation 1 and 2 formula_12¬ ¬ ¬ ¬  (3) The left hand side shows
the present value expenditure and right hand side depicts the present value
income respectively. Multiplying the equation by formula_13 gives us the future
value. Now the consumer has to choose a formula_14 and formula_15 such that
consumer maybe a net saver or a net borrower. If he's initially at a level of
consumption where he's neither of the above(i.e. a net borrower or net saver),
an increase in income may make him a net saver or a net borrower depending on
his preferences. An increase in current income or future income will increase
current and future consumption(consumption smoothing motives). Now, let us
consider a scenario where the interest rates are increased. If the consumer is
a net saver, he will save more in the current period due to the substitution
effect and consume more in the current period due to the income effect. The net
effect thus, becomes ambiguous. If the consumer is a net borrower, however, he
will tend to consume less in the current period due to the substitution effect
and income effect thereby reducing his overall current consumption.
Modigiliani's Life Cycle Income Hypothesis. The Life Cycle Hypothesis is based
on the following model: subject to Œ£LCt(1+r)-t = Œ£NYt(1+r)-t + Wo U(Ct):
satisfaction received from consumption in time period 't' Ct:level of
consumption, Yt: income Œ¥: rate of time preference ( a measure of individual
preference between present and future activity) Wo: initial level of income
producing assets Typically, a person‚Äôs MPC(marginal propensity to consume) is
relatively high during young adulthood, decreases during the middle-age years,
and increases when the person is near or in retirement. The Life Cycle
Hypothesis(LCH) model defines individual behavior as an attempt to smooth out
consumption patterns over one's lifetime somewhat independent of current levels
of income. This model states that early in one's life consumption expenditure
may very well exceed income as the individual may be making major purchases
related to buying a new home, starting a family, and beginning a career. At
this stage in life the individual will borrow from the future to support these
expenditure needs. In mid-life however, these expenditure patterns begin to
level off and are supported or perhaps exceeded by increases in income. At this
stage the individual repays any past borrowings and begins to save for her or
his retirement. Upon retirement, consumption expenditure may begin to decline
however income usually declines dramatically. In this stage of life, the
individual dis-saves or lives off past savings until death. Friedman's
Permanent Income Hypothesis. After the Second World War, it was noticed that a
model in which current consumption was just a function of current income
clearly too simplistic. It could not explain the fact that the long-run average
propensity to consume seemed to be roughly constant despite the marginal
propensity to consume being much lower. Friedman's Permanent Income Hypothesis
are one of the models which seeks to explain this apparent contradiction.
According to the Permanent Income Hypothesis, permanent consumption, CP, is
proportional to permanent income, YP. Permanent income is a subjective notion
of likely medium-run future income. Permanent consumption is a similar notion
of consumption. Actual consumption, C, and actual income, Y, consist of these
permanent components plus unanticipated transitory components, CT and YT,
respectively. CPt =Œ≤2YPt Ct = CPt + CTt Yt = YPt + YTt Hyperbolic discounting.
The article so far has considered cases where individuals make intertemporal
choices by considering the present discounted value of their consumption and
income. Every period in the future is exponentially discounted with the same
interest rate. A different class of economists, however, argue that individuals
are often affected by what is called the temporal myopia. The consumer's
typical response to uncertainty in this case is to sharply reduce the
importance of the future of their decision making.This effect is called
hyperbolic discounting. In the common tongue it reflects the sentiment ‚ÄúEat,
drink and be merry, for tomorrow we may die.‚Äù formula_19 where, "f"("D"):

of discounting When choosing between $100 or $110 a day later,individuals may
want to wait a day for an extra $10. Yet after a month passes, many of these
people will reverse their preferences and now choose the immediate $100 rather
than wait the month for an additional $10. References. (1) http://
