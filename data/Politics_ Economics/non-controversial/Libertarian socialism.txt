Libertarian socialism Libertarian socialism (sometimes called social anarchism,
and sometimes left libertarianism) is a group of political philosophies that
promote a non-hierarchical, non-bureaucratic society without private property
in the means of production. Libertarian socialists believe in converting
present-day private productive property into the commons or public goods, while
retaining respect for personal property. Libertarian socialism is opposed to
coercive forms of social organization. It promotes free association in place of
government and opposes the social relations of capitalism, such as wage labor.
The term libertarian socialism is used by some socialists to differentiate
their philosophy from state socialism or by some as a synonym for left
anarchism. Adherents of libertarian socialism assert that a society based on
freedom and equality can be achieved through abolishing authoritarian
institutions that control certain means of production and subordinate the
majority to an owning class or political and economic elite. Libertarian
socialism also constitutes a tendency of thought that promotes the
identification, criticism, and practical dismantling of illegitimate authority
in all aspects of life. Accordingly, libertarian socialists believe that "the
exercise of power in any institutionalized form‚Äîwhether economic, political,
religious, or sexual‚Äîbrutalizes both the wielder of power and the one over
whom it is exercised". Libertarian socialists generally place their hopes in
decentralized means of direct democracy such as libertarian municipalism,
citizens' assemblies, trade unions, and workers' councils. Political
philosophies commonly described as libertarian socialist include most varieties
of anarchism (especially anarchist communism, anarchist collectivism, anarcho-
syndicalism, mutualism) as well as autonomism, communalism, participism,
libertarian Marxist philosophies such as council communism and Luxemburgism,
and some versions of "utopian socialism and individualist anarchism. Overview.
Libertarian socialism is a western philosophy with diverse interpretations,
though some general commonalities can be found in its many incarnations. Its
proponents generally advocate a worker-oriented system of production and
organization in the workplace that in some aspects radically departs from
neoclassical economics in favor of democratic cooperatives or common ownership
of the means of production (socialism). They propose that this economic system
be executed in a manner that attempts to maximize the liberty of individuals
and minimize concentration of power or authority (libertarianism). Libertarian
socialists are strongly critical of coercive institutions, which often leads
them to reject the legitimacy of the state in favor of anarchism. Adherents
propose achieving this through decentralization of political and economic
power, usually involving the socialization of most large-scale private property
and enterprise (while retaining respect for personal property). Libertarian
socialism tends to deny the legitimacy of most forms of economically
significant private property, viewing capitalist property relations as forms of
domination that are antagonistic to individual freedom. The first anarchist
journal to use the term "libertarian" was "La Libertaire, Journal du Mouvement
Social" and it was published in New York City between 1858 and 1861 by French
anarcho-communist Joseph D√©jacque. "The next recorded use of the term was in
Europe, when "libertarian communism" was used at a French regional anarchist
Congress at Le Havre (16‚Äì22 November 1880). January the following year saw a
French manifesto issued on "Libertarian or Anarchist Communism." Finally, 1895
saw leading anarchists S√©bastien Faure and Louise Michel publish "La
Libertaire" in France." The word stems from the French word "libertaire", and
was used to evade the French ban on anarchist publications. In this tradition,
the term "libertarianism" in "libertarian socialism" is generally used as a
synonym for anarchism, which some say is the original meaning of the term;
hence "libertarian socialism" is equivalent to "socialist anarchism" to these
scholars. In the context of the European socialist movement, "libertarian" has
conventionally been used to describe those who opposed state socialism, such as
Mikhail Bakunin. The association of socialism with libertarianism predates that
of capitalism, and many anti-authoritarians still decry what they see as a
mistaken association of capitalism with libertarianism in the United States. As
Noam Chomsky put it, a consistent libertarian "must oppose private ownership of
the means of production and wage slavery, which is a component of this system,
as incompatible with the principle that labor must be freely undertaken and
under the control of the producer." In a chapter recounting the history of
libertarian socialism, economist Robin Hahnel relates that thus far the period
where libertarian socialism has had its greatest impact was at the end of the
19th century through the first four decades of the twentieth century. Hahnel,

Petersburg and Dimitrov on December 8 ‚Äì 14, 1992. Anti-capitalism.
Libertarian socialists are anti-capitalist, and can thus be distinguished from
right-wing libertarians. Whereas capitalist (and right-libertarian) principles
concentrate economic power in the hands of those who own the most capital,
libertarian socialism aims to distribute power, and thus freedom, more equally
amongst members of society. A key difference between libertarian socialism and
capitalist libertarianism is that advocates of the latter generally believe
that one's degree of freedom is affected by one's economic and social status,
whereas advocates of the former focus on freedom of choice. This is sometimes
characterized as a desire to maximize "free creativity" in a society in
preference to "free enterprise." Libertarian socialists believe if freedom is
valued, then society must work towards a system in which individuals have the
power to decide economic issues along with political issues. Libertarian
socialists seek to replace unjustified authority with direct democracy,
voluntary federation, and popular autonomy in all aspects of life, including
physical communities and economic enterprises. Many libertarian socialists
argue that large-scale voluntary associations should manage industrial
manufacture, while workers retain rights to the individual products of their
labor. As such, they see a distinction between the concepts of "private
property" and "personal possession". Whereas "private property" grants an
individual exclusive control over a thing whether it is in use or not, and
regardless of its productive capacity, "possession" grants no rights to things
that are not in use. Anti-authoritarianism and opposition to the state.
Libertarian socialists generally regard concentrations of power as sources of
oppression that must be continually challenged and justified. Most libertarian
socialists believe that when power is exercised, as exemplified by the
economic, social, or physical dominance of one individual over another, the
burden of proof is always on the authoritarian to justify their action as
legitimate when taken against its effect of narrowing the scope of human
freedom. Libertarian socialists typically oppose rigid and stratified
structures of authority, be they political, economic, or social. In lieu of
corporations and states, libertarian socialists seek to organize society into
voluntary associations (usually collectives, communes, municipalities,
cooperatives, commons, or syndicates) that use direct democracy or consensus
for their decision-making process. Some libertarian socialists advocate
combining these institutions using rotating, recallable to higher-level
federations. Spanish anarchism is a major example of such federations in
practice. Contemporary examples of libertarian socialist organizational and
decision-making models in practice include a number of anti-capitalist and
global justice movements including Zapatista Councils of Good Government and
the Global Indymedia network (which covers 45 countries on six continents).
There are also many examples of indigenous societies around the world whose
political and economic systems can be accurately described as anarchist or
libertarian socialist, each of which is unique and uniquely suited to the
culture that birthed it. For libertarians, that diversity of practice within a
framework of common principles is proof of the vitality of those principles and
of their flexibility and strength. Contrary to popular opinion, libertarian
socialism has not traditionally been a utopian movement, tending to avoid dense
theoretical analysis or prediction of what a future society would or should
look like. The tradition instead has been that such decisions cannot be made
now, and must be made through struggle and experimentation, so that the best
solution can be arrived at democratically and organically, and to base the
direction for struggle on established historical example. They point out that
the success of the scientific method comes from its adherence to open rational
exploration, not its conclusions, in sharp contrast to dogma and predetermined
predictions. To libertarian socialists, dogmatic approaches to social
organization are doomed to failure; and thus they reject Marxist notions of
linear and inevitable historical progression. Noted anarchist Rudolf Rocker
once stated, "I am an anarchist not because I believe anarchism is the final
goal, but because there is no such thing as a final goal". Because libertarian
socialism encourages exploration and embraces a diversity of ideas rather than
forming a compact movement, there have arisen inevitable controversies over
individuals who describe themselves as libertarian socialists but disagree with
some of the core principles of libertarian socialism. For example, Peter Hain
interprets libertarian socialism as minarchist rather than anarchist, favoring
radical decentralization of power without going as far as the complete
abolition of the state and libertarian socialist Noam Chomsky supports
dismantling all forms of unjustified social or economic power, while also
emphasizing that state intervention should be supported as a temporary
protection while oppressive structures remain in existence. Proponents are
known for opposing the existence of states or government and refusing to
participate in coercive state institutions. Indeed, in the past many refused to
swear oaths in court or to participate in trials, even when they faced
imprisonment or deportation. Civil liberties and individual freedom.
Libertarian socialists have been strong advocates and activists of civil
liberties that provide an individual specific rights such as the freedom in
issues of love and sex (free love) (see Anarchism and issues related to love
and sex) and of thought and conscience (freethought). In this activism they
have clashed with state and religious institutions which have limited such
rights (see Anarchism and religion). Anarchism has been an important advocate
of free love since its birth. Later a strong tendency of free love appeared
alongside anarcha-feminism and advocacy of LGBT rights (see Anarchism and
issues related to LGBTI persons). In recent times anarchism has also voiced
opinions and taken action around certain sex related subjects such as
pornography, BDSM and the sex industry. Anarcha-feminism developed as a
synthesis of radical feminism and anarchism that views patriarchy (male
domination over women) as a fundamental manifestation of compulsory government.
It was inspired by the late 19th century writings of early feminist anarchists
such as Lucy Parsons, Emma Goldman, Voltairine de Cleyre and Virginia Bolten.
Anarcha-feminists, like other radical feminists, criticise and advocate the
abolition of traditional conceptions of family, education and gender roles.
Also the council communist Sylvia Pankhurst was a feminist activist as well as
a libertarian marxist. Anarchists also took a pioneering interest in issues
related to LGBTI persons. An important current within anarchism is free love.
Free love advocates sometimes traced their roots back to the early anarchist
Josiah Warren and to experimental communities, viewed sexual freedom as a
clear, direct expression of an individual's self-ownership. Free love
particularly stressed women's rights since most sexual laws discriminated
against women: for example, marriage laws and anti-birth control measures.
Libertarian socialists have traditionally been skeptical of and opposed to
organized religion. Freethought is a philosophical viewpoint that holds
opinions should be formed on the basis of science, logic, and reason, and
should not be influenced by authority, tradition, or other dogmas. The
cognitive application of freethought is known as "freethinking," and
practitioners of freethought are known as "freethinkers." In the United States
"freethought was a basically anti-Christian, anti-clerical movement, whose
purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide
for himself on religious matters. A number of contributors to "Liberty"
(anarchist publication) were prominent figures in both freethought and
anarchism. The individualist anarchist George MacDonald was a co-editor of
"Freethought" and, for a time, "The Truth Seeker". E.C. Walker was co-editor of
the...free-thought / free love journal "Lucifer, the Light-Bearer"". "Free
Society" (1895‚Äì1897 as "The Firebrand"; 1897‚Äì1904 as "Free Society") was a
major anarchist newspaper in the United States at the end of the nineteenth and
beginning of the twentieth centuries. The publication staunchly advocated free
love and women's rights, and critiqued "Comstockery" ‚Äì censorship of sexual
information. In 1901, Catalan anarchist and free-thinker Francesc Ferrer i
Gu√ rdia established "modern" or progressive schools in Barcelona in defiance
of an educational system controlled by the Catholic Church. The schools' stated
goal was to "educate the working class in a rational, secular and non-coercive
setting". Fiercely anti-clerical, Ferrer believed in "freedom in education",
education free from the authority of church and state (see Anarchism and
education). Violent and non-violent means. Pierre-Joseph Proudhon argued in
favor of a non-violent revolution through a process of dual power in which
libertarian socialist institutions would be established and form associations
enabling the formation of an expanding network within the existing state-
capitalist framework with the intention of eventually rendering both the state
and the capitalist economy obsolete. The progression towards violence in
anarchism stemmed, in part, from the massacres of some of the communes inspired
by the ideas of Proudhon and others. Many anarcho-communists began to see a
need for revolutionary violence to counteract the violence inherent in both
capitalism and government. Anarcho-pacifism is a tendency within the anarchist
movement which rejects the use of violence in the struggle for social change.
The main early influences were the thought of Henry David Thoreau and Leo
Tolstoy. It developed "mostly in Holland "(sic)", Britain, and the United
States, before and during the Second World War". Opposition to the use of
violence has not prohibited anarcho-pacifists from accepting the principle of
resistance or even revolutionary action (see: non-violent revolution) provided
it does not result in violence; it was in fact their approval of such forms of
opposition to power that lead many anarcho-pacifists to endorse the anarcho-
syndicalist concept of the general strike as the great revolutionary weapon.
Later anarcho-pacifists have also come to endorse to non-violent strategy of
dual power. Other anarchists have believed that violence (especially self-
defense) is justified as a way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a
social revolution. Political roots. Within early modern socialist thought and
"utopian" socialism. Peasant revolts in the post-reformation era. Various
libertarian socialist authors have identified the written work of English
Protestant social reformer Gerrard Winstanley and the social activism of his
group, the Diggers, as anticipating this line of thought. For anarchist
historian George Woodcock "Although (Pierre Joseph) Proudhon was the first
writer to call himself an anarchist, at least two predecessors outlined systems
that contain all the basic elements of anarchism. The first was Gerrard
Winstanley (1609-c. 1660), a linen draper who led the small movement of the
Diggers during the Commonwealth. Winstanley and his followers protested in the
name of a radical Christianity against the economic distress that followed the
Civil War and against the inequality that the grandees of the New Model Army
seemed intent on preserving. In 1649‚Äì1650 the Diggers squatted on stretches
of common land in southern England and attempted to set up communities based on
work on the land and the sharing of goods. The communities failed, but a series
of pamphlets by Winstanley survived, of which "The New Law of Righteousness"
(1649) was the most important. Advocating a rational Christianity, Winstanley
equated Christ with ‚Äúthe universal liberty‚Äù and declared the universally
corrupting nature of authority. He saw ‚Äúan equal privilege to share in the
blessing of liberty‚Äù and detected an intimate link between the institution of
property and the lack of freedom." In the modern world, anarchism first
appeared as a movement of the peasantry and yeomanry against declining feudal
institutions. In Germany its foremost spokesman during the Peasant Wars was
Thomas Muenzer; in England, Gerrard Winstanley, a leading participant in the
Digger movement. The concepts held by Muenzer and Winstanley were superbly
attuned to the needs of their time ‚Äî a historical period when the majority of
the population lived in the countryside and when the most militant
revolutionary forces came from an agrarian world. It would be painfully
academic to argue whether Muenzer and Winstanley could have achieved their
ideals. What is of real importance is that they spoke to their time; their
anarchist concepts followed naturally from the rural society that furnished the
bands of the peasant armies in Germany and the New Model in England. The
Enlightenment. Another often mentioned name is that of English enlightenment
thinker William Godwin. For Woodcock a more elaborate sketch of anarchism,
although still without the name, was provided by William Godwin in his "Enquiry
Concerning Political Justice" (1793). Godwin was a gradualist anarchist rather
than a revolutionary anarchist; he differed from most later anarchists in
preferring above revolutionary action the gradual and, as it seemed to him,
more natural process of discussion among men of good will, by which he hoped
truth would eventually triumph through its own power. Godwin, who was
influenced by the English tradition of Dissent and the French philosophy of the
Enlightenment, put forward in a developed form the basic anarchist criticisms
of the state, of accumulated property, and of the delegation of authority
through democratic procedure." During the French Revolution, Sylvain Mar√©chal,
in his "Manifesto of the Equals" (1796), demanded "the communal enjoyment of
the fruits of the earth" and looked forward to the disappearance of "the
revolting distinction of rich and poor, of great and small, of masters and
valets, of governors and governed." The term "anarchist" first entered the
English language in 1642, during the English Civil War, as a term of abuse,
used by Royalists against their Roundhead opponents. By the time of the French
Revolution some, such as the "Enrag√©s", began to use the term positively, in
opposition to Jacobin centralisation of power, seeing "revolutionary
government" as oxymoronic. By the turn of the 19th century, the English word
"anarchism" had lost its initial negative connotation. The Romantic era and
"Utopian Socialism". Kent Bromley, in his preface to Peter Kropotkin's book
"The Conquest of Bread", considered early French socialist Charles Fourier to
be the founder of the libertarian branch of socialist thought, as opposed to
the authoritarian socialist ideas of Babeuf and Buonarroti. Anarchist Hakim Bey
describes Fourier's ideas as follows: "In Fourier's system of Harmony all
creative activity including industry, craft, agriculture, etc. will arise from
liberated passion ‚Äî this is the famous theory of "attractive labor." Fourier
sexualizes work itself ‚Äî the life of the Phalanstery is a continual orgy of
intense feeling, intellection, & activity, a society of lovers & wild
enthusiasts." Fourierism manifested itself "in the middle of the 19th century
(where) literally hundreds of communes (phalansteries) were founded on
fourierist principles in France, N. America, Mexico, S. America, Algeria,
Yugoslavia, etc. Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, Friedrich Engels, and Peter Kropotkin
all read him with fascination, as did Andr√© Breton and Roland Barthes.
Anarchist Peter Sabatini reports that in the United States "of early to mid-
19th century, there appeared an array of communal and "utopian" counterculture
groups (including the so-called free love movement). William Godwin's anarchism
exerted an ideological influence on some of this, but more so the socialism of
Robert Owen and Charles Fourier. After success of his British venture, Owen
himself established a cooperative community within the United States at New
Harmony, Indiana during 1825. One member of this commune was Josiah Warren
(1798‚Äì1874), considered to be the first individualist anarchist". Anarchism.
Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, who is often considered the father of modern anarchism,
coined the phrase "Property is theft" to describe part of his view on the
complex nature of ownership in relation to freedom. When he said property is
theft, he was referring to the capitalist who he believed stole profit from
laborers. For Proudhon, the capitalist's employee was "subordinated, exploited:
his permanent condition is one of obedience." Seventeen years (1857) after
Proudhon first called himself an anarchist (1840), anarchist communist Joseph
D√©jacque was the first person to describe himself as a libertarian. Outside
the United States, "libertarian" generally refers to anti-authoritarian anti-
capitalist ideologies. Back in the United States, Henry George spearheaded the
Single Tax Movement, which sought socialism via progressive taxation, with tax
only on natural resources. This might be seen as a predecessor to libertarian
socialism trends there. Libertarian socialism has its roots in both classical
liberalism and socialism, though it is often in conflict with liberalism
(especially neoliberalism and right-libertarianism) and authoritarian State
socialism simultaneously. While libertarian socialism has roots in both
socialism and liberalism, different forms have different levels of influence
from the two traditions. For instance mutualist anarchism is more influenced by
liberalism while communist and syndicalist anarchism are more influenced by
socialism. It is interesting to note, however, that mutualist anarchism has its
origins in 18th and 19th century European socialism (such as Fourierian
socialism) while communist and syndicalist anarchism has its earliest origins
in early 18th century liberalism (such as the French Revolution). Anarchism
posed an early challenge to the vanguardism and statism it detected in
important sectors of the socialist movement. As such "The consequences of the
growth of parliamentary action, ministerialism, and party life, charged the
anarchists, would be de-radicalism and embourgeoisiement. Further, state
politics would subvert both true individuality and true community. In response,
many anarchists refused Marxist-type organisation, seeking to dissolve or
undermine power and hierarchy by way of loose political-cultural groupings, or
by championing organisation by a single, similtaneously economic and political
administrative unit (Ruhle, Syndicalism). The power of the intellectual and of
science were also rejected by many anarchists: ‚ÄúIn conquering the state, in
exalting the role of parties, they reinforce the hierarchical principle
embodied in political and administrative institutions‚Äù.[47 Revolutions could
only come through force of circumstances and/or the inherently rebellious
instincts of the masses (the ‚Äúinstinct for freedom‚Äù (Bakunin, Chomsky)).
Thus, in Bakunin‚Äôs words: ‚ÄúAll that individuals can do is to clarify,
propagate, and work out ideas corresponding to the popular instinct‚Äù.".
Marxism. Marxism started to develop a libertarian strand of thought after
specific circumstances. "One does find early expressions of such perspectives
in (William) Morris and the Socialist Party of Great Britain (the SPGB), then
again around the events of 1905, with the growing concern at the
bureaucratisation and de-radicalisation of international socialism". Morris
established the Socialist League in December 1884, which was encouraged by
Friedrich Engels and Eleanor Marx. As the leading figure in the organization
Morris embarked on a relentless series of speeches and talks on street corners,
in working men's clubs and lecture theatres across England and Scotland. From
1887, anarchists began to outnumber socialists in the Socialist League. The 3rd
Annual Conference of the League, held in London on 29 May 1887 marked the
change, with a majority of the 24 branch delegates voting in favor of an
anarchist-sponsored resolution declaring that "This conference endorses the
policy of abstention from parliamentary action, hitherto pursued by the League,
and sees no sufficient reason for altering it." Morris played peacemaker but
sided with the anti-Parliamentarians, who won control of the League, which
consequently lost the support of Engels and saw the departure of Eleanor Marx
and her partner Edward Aveling to form the separate Bloomsbury Socialist
Society. However, "the most important ruptures are to be traced to the
insurgency during and after the First World War. Disillusioned with the
capitulation of the social democrats, excited by the emergence of workers‚Äô
councils, and slowly distanced from Leninism, many communists came to reject
the claims of socialist parties and to put their faith instead in the masses."
For these socialists, ‚ÄúThe intuition of the masses in action can have more
genius in it than the work of the greatest individual genius‚Äù. Luxemburg‚Äôs
workerism and spontaneism are exemplary of positions later taken up by the far-
left of the period ‚Äì Pannekoek, Roland Holst, and Gorter in Holland, Sylvia
Pankhurst in Britain, Gramsci in Italy, Lukacs in Hungary. In these
formulations, the dictatorship of the proletariat was to be the dictatorship of
a class, ‚Äúnot of a party or of a clique‚Äù." However within this line of
thought "The tension between anti-vanguardism and vanguardism has frequently
resolved itself in two diametrically opposed ways: the first involved a drift
towards the party; the second saw a move towards the idea of complete
proletarian spontaneity...The first course is exemplified most clearly in
Gramsci and Lukacs...The second course is illustrated in the tendency,
developing from the Dutch and German far-lefts, which inclined towards the
complete eradication of the party form." In the emerging Soviet state there
appeared Left-wing uprisings against the Bolsheviks which were a series of
rebellions and uprisings against the Bolsheviks led or supported by left wing
groups including Socialist Revolutionaries, Left Socialist Revolutionaries,
Mensheviks, and anarchists. Some were in support of the White Movement while
some tried to be an independent force. The uprisings started in 1918 and
continued through the Russian Civil War and after until 1922. In response the
Bolsheviks increasingly abandoned attempts to get these groups to join the
government and suppressed them with force. For "many Marxian libertarian
socialists, the political bankruptcy of socialist orthodoxy necessitated a
theoretical break. This break took a number of forms. The Bordigists and the
SPGB championed a super-Marxian intransigence in theoretical matters. Other
socialists made a return ‚Äúbehind Marx‚Äù to the anti-positivist programme of
German idealism. Libertarian socialism has frequently linked its anti-
authoritarian political aspirations with this theoretical differentiation from
orthodoxy... Karl Korsch... remained a libertarian socialist for a large part
of his life and because of the persistent urge towards theoretical openness in
his work. Korsch rejected the eternal and static, and he was obsessed by the
essential role of practice in a theory‚Äôs truth. For Korsch, no theory could
escape history, not even Marxism. In this vein, Korsch even credited the
stimulus for Marx‚Äôs Capital to the movement of the oppressed classes. " In
rejecting both capitalism and the state, some libertarian socialists align
themselves with anarchists in opposition to both capitalist representative
democracy and to authoritarian forms of Marxism. Although anarchists and
Marxists share an ultimate goal of a stateless society, anarchists criticise
most Marxists for advocating a transitional phase under which the state is used
to achieve this aim. Nonetheless, libertarian Marxist tendencies such as
autonomist Marxism and council communism have historically been intertwined
with the anarchist movement. Anarchist movements have come into conflict with
both capitalist and Marxist forces, sometimes at the same time, as in the
Spanish Civil War, though as in that war Marxists themselves are often divided
in support or opposition to anarchism. Other political persecutions under
bureaucratic parties have resulted in a strong historical antagonism between
anarchists and libertarian Marxists on the one hand and Leninist Marxists and
their derivatives such as Maoists on the other. In recent history, however,
libertarian socialists have repeatedly formed temporary alliances with Marxist-
Leninist groups for the purposes of protest against institutions they both
reject. Part of this antagonism can be traced to the International Workingmen's
Association, the "First International", a congress of radical workers, where
Mikhail Bakunin, who was fairly representative of anarchist views, and Karl
Marx, whom anarchists accused of being an "authoritarian", came into conflict
on various issues. Bakunin's viewpoint on the illegitimacy of the state as an
institution and the role of electoral politics was starkly counterposed to
Marx's views in the First International. Marx and Bakunin's disputes eventually
led to Marx taking control of the First International and expelling Bakunin and
his followers from the organization. This was the beginning of a long-running
feud and schism between libertarian socialists and what they call
"authoritarian communists", or alternatively just "authoritarians". Some
Marxists have formulated views that closely resemble syndicalism, and thus
express more affinity with anarchist ideas. Several libertarian socialists,
notably Noam Chomsky, believe that anarchism shares much in common with certain
variants of Marxism such as the council communism of Marxist Anton Pannekoek.
In Chomsky's "Notes on Anarchism", he suggests the possibility "that some form
of council communism is the natural form of revolutionary socialism in an
industrial society. It reflects the belief that democracy is severely limited
when the industrial system is controlled by any form of autocratic elite,
whether of owners, managers, and technocrats, a 'vanguard' party, or a State
bureaucracy." In the People's Republic of China (PRC) since 1967, the terms
Ultra-Left and left communist refers to political theory and practice self-
defined as further "left" than that of the central Maoist leaders at the height
of the GPCR ("Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution"). The terms are also used
retroactively to describe some early 20th century Chinese anarchist
orientations. As a slur, the Communist Party of China (CPC) has used the term
"ultra-left" more broadly to denounce any orientation it considers further
"left" than the party line. According to the latter usage, in 1978 the CPC
Central Committee denounced as "ultra-left" the line of Mao Zedong from 1956
until his death in 1976. "Ultra-Left" refers to those GPCR rebel positions that
diverged from the central Maoist line by identifying an antagonistic
contradiction between the CPC-PRC party-state itself and the masses of workers
and "peasants" conceived as a single proletarian class divorced from any
meaningful control over production or distribution. Whereas the central Maoist
line maintained that the masses controlled the means of production through the
Party's mediation, the Ultra-Left argued that the objective interests of
bureaucrats were structurally determined by the centralist state-form in direct
opposition to the objective interests of the masses, regardless of however
"red" a given bureaucrat's "thought" might be. Whereas the central Maoist
leaders encouraged the masses to criticize reactionary "ideas" and "habits"
among the alleged 5% of bad cadres, giving them a chance to "turn over a new
leaf" after they had undergone "thought reform," the Ultra-Left argued that
"cultural revolution" had to give way to "political revolution" ‚Äì "in which
one class overthrows another class". In 1969 french platformist anarcho-
communist Daniel Guerin published an essay called "Libertarian Marxism?" in
which he dealt with the debate between Karl Marx and Mikhail Bakunin at the
First International and afterwards he suggested that "Libertarian marxism
rejects determinism and fatalism, giving the greator place to individual will,
intuition, imagination, reflex speeds, and to the deep instincts of the masses,
which are more far-seeing in hours of crisis than the reasonings of the
‚Äòelites‚Äô; libertarian marxism thinks of the effects of surprise,
provocation and boldness, refuses to be cluttered and paralysed by a heavy
‚Äòscientific‚Äô apparatus, doesn‚Äôt equivocate or bluff, and guards itself
from adventurism as much as from fear of the unknown." Autonomist Marxism, Neo-
Marxism and Situationist theory are also regarded as being anti-authoritarian
variants of Marxism that are firmly within the libertarian socialist tradition.
Notable libertarian socialist tendencies. Classical anarchist tendencies. In a
chronological and theoretical sense, there are classical ‚Äî those created
throughout the 19th century ‚Äî and post-classical anarchist schools ‚Äî those
created since the mid-20th century and after. Mutualism. "Under the law of
association, transmission of wealth does not apply to the instruments of
labour, so cannot become a cause of inequality... We are socialists... under
universal association, ownership of the land and of the instruments of labour
is "social" ownership... We want the mines, canals, railways handed over to
democratically organised workers' associations... We want these associations to
be models for agriculture, industry and trade, the pioneering core of that vast
federation of companies and societies, joined together in the common bond of
the democratic and social Republic." Mutualists believe that a free labor
market would allow for conditions of equal income in proportion to exerted
labor. As Jonathan Beecher puts it, Proudhon's aim was to, "emancipate labor
from the constraints imposed by capital". Proudhon supported individual
possession of land and argued that the "land is indispensable to our existence,
consequently a common thing, consequently insusceptible of appropriation." He
believed that an individual only had a right to land while he was using or
occupying it. If the individual ceases doing so, it reverts to unowned land.
Mutualists hold a labor theory of value, arguing that in exchange labor should
always be worth "the amount of labor necessary to produce an article of exactly
similar and equal utility," and considering anything less to be exploitation,
theft of labor, or usury. Mutualists oppose the institutions by which
individuals gain income through loans, investments, and rent, as they believe
the income received through these activities is not in direct accord with labor
spent. In place of these capitalist institutions they advocate labor-owned
cooperative firms and associations. Mutualists advocate mutual banks, owned by
the workers, that do not charge interest on secured loans. Most mutualists
believe that anarchy should be achieved gradually rather than through
revolution. Worker cooperatives such as the Mondrag√≥n Cooperative Corporation
follow an economic model similar to that of mutualism. The model followed by
the corporation WL Gore and Associates, inventor of Gore-Tex fabrics, is also
similar to mutualism as there is no chain of command and salaries are
determined collectively by the workers. G.D.H. Cole's guild socialism was
similar to mutualism. Today, mutualism's stress on worker association is
similar to the more developed modern theory of participatory economics,
although participatory economists do not believe in markets. Mutualist
anarchist ideas continue to have influence today, even if indirectly. Many
modern day cooperatives are influenced directly or indirectly by economic
mutualism that became popular in the late 19th century. Kevin Carson is a
contemporary mutualist theorist who is the author of "Studies in Mutualist
Political Economy". Some individualist anarchists, such as Benjamin Tucker,
were influenced by Proudhon's Mutualism, but unlike Proudhon, they did not call
for "association" in large enterprises. Collectivist anarchism. Collectivist
anarchism (also known as anarcho-collectivism) is a revolutionary doctrine that
advocates the abolition of the state and private ownership of the means of
production. Instead, it envisions the means of production being owned
collectively and controlled and managed by the producers themselves. For the
collectivization of the means of production, it was originally envisaged that
workers will revolt and forcibly collectivize the means of production Once
collectivization takes place, workers' salaries would be determined in
democratic organizations based on the amount of time they contributed to
production. These salaries would be used to purchase goods in a communal
market. This contrasts with anarcho-communism where wages would be abolished,
and where individuals would take freely from a storehouse of goods "to each
according to his need." Thus, Bakunin's "Collectivist Anarchism",
notwithstanding the title, is seen as a blend of individualism and
collectivism. Collectivist anarchism is most commonly associated with Mikhail
Bakunin, the anti-authoritarian sections of the First International, and the
early Spanish anarchist movement. Anarchist communism. Anarchist communism
(also known as anarcho-communism and occasionally as free communism) is a
theory of anarchism which advocates the abolition of the state, markets, money,
capitalism and private property (while retaining respect for personal
property), in favor of common ownership of the means of production, direct
democracy and a horizontal network of voluntary associations and workers'
councils with production and consumption based on the guiding principle: "from
each according to his ability, to each according to his need". Some forms of
anarchist communism, such as insurrectionary anarchism, are strongly influenced
by egoism and radical individualism, believing anarcho-communism is the best
social system for the realization of individual freedom. Most anarcho-
communists view anarcho-communism as a way of reconciling the opposition
between the individual and society. Anarcho-communism developed out of radical
socialist currents after the French revolution but was first formulated as such
in the Italian section of the First International. The theoretical work of
Peter Kropotkin took importance later as it expanded and developed pro-
organizationalist and insurrectionary anti-organizationalist sections. To date,
the best known examples of an anarchist communist society (ie, established
around the ideas as they exist today and achieving worldwide attention and
knowledge in the historical canon), are the anarchist territories during the
Spanish Revolution and the Free Territory during the Russian Revolution.
Through the efforts and influence of the Spanish Anarchists during the Spanish
Revolution within the Spanish Civil War, starting in 1936 anarchist communism
existed in most of Aragon, parts of the Levante and Andalusia, and in the
stronghold of Anarchist Catalonia before being crushed by the combined forces
of Francoism, Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, Spanish Communist Party
repression (backed by the USSR) as well as economic and armaments blockades
from the capitalist countries and the Spanish Republic itself. During the
Russian Revolution, anarchists such as Nestor Makhno worked to create and
defend‚Äîthrough the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine‚Äîanarchist
communism in the Free Territory of the Ukraine from 1919 before being conquered
by the Bolsheviks in 1921. Anarcho-communist currents include platformism and
insurrectionary anarchism. The anarchist-communist tradition continues today,
for instance in the work of L. Susan Brown. Brown's conception of libertarian
socialists is that all social bonds should be developed by individuals who have
an equal amount of bargaining power, that an accumulation of economic power in
the hands of a few and the centralization of political power both reduce the
bargaining power‚Äîand thus the liberty of the other individuals in society.
Within individualist anarchism. Individualist anarchism refers to several
traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasize the
individual and his or her will over external determinants such as groups,
society, traditions, and ideological systems. Josiah Warren is widely regarded
as the first American anarchist, and the four-page weekly paper he edited
during 1833, "The Peaceful Revolutionist", was the first anarchist periodical
published. For American anarchist historian Eunice Minette Schuster "It is
apparent...that Proudhonian Anarchism was to be found in the United States at
least as early as 1848 and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the
Individualist Anarchism of Josiah Warren and Stephen Pearl Andrews...William B.
Greene presented this Proudhonian Mutualism in its purest and most systematic
form.". Later the american individualist anarchist Benjamin Tucker "was against
both the state and capitalism, against both oppression and exploitation. While
not against the market and property he was firmly against capitalism as it was,
in his eyes, a state-supported monopoly of social capital (tools, machinery,
etc.) which allows owners to exploit their employees, i.e., to avoid paying
workers the full value of their labour. He thought that the "labouring classes
are deprived of their earnings by usury in its three forms, interest, rent and
profit."... Therefore ""Liberty" will abolish interest; it will abolish profit;
it will abolish monopolistic rent; it will abolish taxation; it will abolish
the exploitation of labour; it will abolish all means whereby any labourer can
be deprived of any of his product."...This stance puts him squarely in the
libertarian socialist tradition and, unsurprisingly, Tucker referred to himself
many times as a socialist and considered his philosophy to be "Anarchistic
socialism.". French individualist anarchist Emile Armand shows clearly
opposition to capitalism and centralized economies when he said that the
individualist anarchist "inwardly he remains refractory ‚Äì fatally refractory
‚Äì morally, intellectually, economically (The capitalist economy and the
directed economy, the speculators and the fabricators of single are equally
repugnant to him.)" The spanish individualist anarchist Miguel Gimenez Igualada
thought that ""capitalism is an effect of government; the disappearance of
government means capitalism falls from its pedestal vertiginously...That which
we call capitalism is not something else but a product of the State, within
which the only thing that is being pushed forward is profit, good or badly
acquired. And so to fight against capitalism is a pointless task, since be it
State capitalism or Enterprise capitalism, as long as Government exists,
exploiting capital will exist. The fight, but of consciousness, is against the
State.". His view on class division and technocracy are as follows "Since when
no one works for another, the profiteer from wealth disappears, just as
government will disappear when no one pays attention to those who learned four
things at universities and from that fact they pretend to govern men. Big
industrial enterprises will be transformed by men in big associations in which
everyone will work and enjoy the product of their work. And from those easy as
well as beautiful problems anarchism deals with and he who puts them in
practice and lives them are anarchists... The priority which without rest an
anarchist must make is that in which no one has to exploit anyone, no man to no
man, since that non-exploitation will lead to the limitation of property to
individual needs". The anarchist writer and bohemian Oscar Wilde wrote in his
famous essay "The Soul of Man under Socialism" that "Art is individualism, and
individualism is a disturbing and disintegrating force. There lies its immense
value. For what it seeks is to disturb monotony of type, slavery of custom,
tyranny of habit, and the reduction of man to the level of a machine." For
anarchist historian George Woodcock "Wilde's aim in "The Soul of Man under
Socialism" is to seek the society most favorable to the artist... for Wilde art
is the supreme end, containing within itself enlightenment and regeneration, to
which all else in society must be subordinated... Wilde represents the
anarchist as aesthete." In a socialist society, people will have the
possibility to realise their talents; "each member of the society will share in
the general prosperity and happiness of the society." Wilde added that "upon
the other hand, Socialism itself will be of value simply because it will lead
to individualism" since individuals will no longer need to fear poverty or
starvation. This individualism would, in turn, protect against governments
"armed with economic power as they are now with political power" over their
citizens. However, Wilde advocated non-capitalist individualism: "of course, it
might be said that the Individualism generated under conditions of private
property is not always, or even as a rule, of a fine or wonderful type" a
critique which is "quite true." In this way socialism, in Wilde's imagination,
would free men from manual labour and allow them to devote their time to
creative pursuits, thus developing their soul. He ended by declaring "The new
individualism is the new hellenism". Anarcho-syndicalism. Anarcho-syndicalism
is a branch of anarchism that focuses on the labor movement. Anarcho-
syndicalists view labor unions as a potential force for revolutionary social
change, replacing capitalism and the state with a new society democratically
self-managed by workers. Workers' solidarity means that anarcho-syndicalists
believe all workers‚Äîno matter their race, gender, or ethnic group‚Äîare in a
similar situation in regard to their (class consciousness). Furthermore, it
means that, within capitalism, any gains or losses made by some workers from or
to bosses will eventually affect all workers. Therefore, to themselves, all
workers must support one another in their class conflict. Anarcho-syndicalists
believe that only direct action‚Äîthat is, action concentrated on directly
attaining a goal, as opposed to indirect action, such as electing a
representative to a government position‚Äîwill allow workers to liberate
themselves. Moreover, anarcho-syndicalists believe that workers' organizations
(the organizations that struggle against the wage system, which, in anarcho-
syndicalist theory, will eventually form the basis of a new society) should be
self-managing. They should not have bosses or "business agents"; rather, the
workers should be able to make all the decisions that affect them themselves.
Rudolf Rocker was one of the most popular voices in the anarcho-syndicalist
movement. He outlined a view of the origins of the movement, what it sought,
and why it was important to the future of labor in his 1938 pamphlet "Anarcho-
Syndicalism". The International Workers Association is an international
anarcho-syndicalist federation of various labor unions from different
countries. The Spanish Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo played and still
plays a major role in the Spanish labor movement. It was also an important
force in the Spanish Civil War. Libertarian Marxist tendencies. Libertarian
Marxism refers to a broad scope of economic and political philosophies that
emphasize the anti-authoritarian aspects of Marxism. Early currents of
libertarian Marxism, known as left communism, emerged in opposition to
Marxism‚ÄìLeninism and its derivatives, such as Stalinism, Maoism, and
Trotskyism. Libertarian Marxism is also critical of reformist positions, such
as those held by social democrats. Libertarian Marxist currents often draw from
Marx and Engels' later works, specifically the "Grundrisse" and "The Civil War
in France"; emphasizing the Marxist belief in the ability of the working class
to forge its own destiny without the need for a revolutionary party or state to
mediate or aid its liberation. Along with anarchism, Libertarian Marxism is one
of the main currents of libertarian socialism. Libertarian Marxism includes
such currents as Luxemburgism, council communism, left communism, "Socialisme
ou Barbarie", the Johnson‚ÄìForest tendency, world socialism, Lettrism/
Situationism and operaismo/autonomism, and New Left. Libertarian Marxism has
often had a strong influence on both post-left and social anarchists. Notable
theorists of libertarian Marxism have included Anton Pannekoek, Raya
Dunayevskaya, CLR James, Antonio Negri, Cornelius Castoriadis, Maurice Brinton,
Guy Debord, Daniel Gu√©rin, Ernesto Screpanti and Raoul Vaneigem. De Leonism.
De Leonism, occasionally known as Marxism-Deleonism, is a form of syndicalist
Marxism developed by Daniel De Leon. De Leon was an early leader of the first
United States socialist political party, the Socialist Labor Party of America.
De Leon combined the rising theories of syndicalism in his time with orthodox
Marxism. According to De Leonist theory, militant industrial unions
(specialized trade unions) are the vehicle of class struggle. Industrial Unions
serving the interests of the proletariat will bring about the change needed to
establish a socialist system. The only way this differs from some currents in
anarcho-syndicalism is that, according to De Leonist thinking, a revolutionary
political party is also necessary to fight for the proletariat on the political
field. De Leonism lies outside the Leninist tradition of communism. It predates
Leninism as De Leonism's principles developed in the early 1890s with De Leon's
assuming leadership of the Socialist Labor Party; Leninism and its vanguard
party idea took shape after the 1902 publication of Lenin's "What Is to Be
Done?". The highly decentralized and democratic nature of the proposed De
Leonist government is in contrast to the democratic centralism of
Marxism‚ÄìLeninism and what they see as the dictatorial nature of the Soviet
Union and the People's Republic of China and other "communist" states. The
success of the De Leonist plan depends on achieving majority support among the
people both in the workplaces and at the polls, in contrast to the Leninist
notion that a small vanguard party should lead the working class to carry out
the revolution. Council communism. Council communism was a radical Left
movement originating in Germany and the Netherlands in the 1920s. Its primary
organization was the Communist Workers Party of Germany (KAPD). Council
communism continues today as a theoretical and activist position within
Marxism, and also within libertarian socialism. The central argument of council
communism, in contrast to those of Social democracy and Leninist communism, is
that workers' councils arising in the factories and municipalities are the
natural and legitimate form of working class organisation and government power.
This view is opposed to the reformist and Bolshevik stress on vanguard parties,
parliaments, or the state. The core principle of council communism is that the
state and the economy should be managed by workers' councils, composed of
delegates elected at workplaces and recallable at any moment. As such, council
communists oppose state-run "bureaucratic socialism". They also oppose the idea
of a "revolutionary party", since council communists believe that a revolution
led by a party will necessarily produce a party dictatorship. Council
communists support a workers' democracy, which they want to produce through a
federation of workers' councils. The Russian word for council is "soviet", and
during the early years of the revolution worker's councils were politically
significant in Russia. It was to take advantage of the aura of workplace power
that the word became used by Vladimir Lenin for various political organs.
Indeed, the name "Supreme Soviet", by which the parliament was called; and that
of the Soviet Union itself make use of this terminology, but they do not imply
any decentralization. Furthermore, council communists held a critique of the
Soviet Union as a capitalist state, believing that the Bolshevik revolution in
Russia became a "bourgeois revolution" when a party bureaucracy replaced the
old feudal aristocracy. Although most felt the Russian Revolution was working
class in character, they believed that, since capitalist relations still
existed (because the workers had no say in running the economy), the Soviet
Union ended up as a state capitalist country, with the state replacing the
individual capitalist. Thus, council communists support workers' revolutions,
but oppose one-party dictatorships. Council communists also believed in
diminishing the role of the party to one of agitation and propaganda, rejected
all participation in elections or parliament, and argued that workers should
leave the reactionary trade unions and form one big revolutionary union. Left
communism. Left communism' is the range of communist viewpoints held by the
communist left, which criticizes the political ideas of the Bolsheviks at
certain periods, from a position that is asserted to be more authentically
Marxist and proletarian than the views of Leninism held by the Communist
International after its first and during its second congress. Left Communists
see themselves to the left of Leninists (whom they tend to see as 'left of
capital', not socialists), Anarchists (some of whom they consider
internationalist socialists) as well as some other revolutionary socialist
tendencies (for example De Leonists, who they tend to see as being
internationalist socialists only in limited instances). Although she lived
before left communism became a distinct tendency, Rosa Luxemburg has heavily
influenced most left communists, both politically and theoretically. Proponents
of left communism have included Amadeo Bordiga, Herman Gorter, Anton Pannekoek,
Otto R√ºhle, Karl Korsch, Sylvia Pankhurst and Paul Mattick. Prominent left
communist groups existing today include the International Communist Current and
the International Bureau for the Revolutionary Party. Also, different factions
from the old Bordigist International Communist Party are considered left
communist organizations. Johnson‚ÄìForest tendency. The Johnson‚ÄìForest
tendency, sometimes called the Johnsonites, refers to a radical left tendency
in the United States associated with Marxist theorists C.L.R. James and Raya
Dunayevskaya, who used the pseudonyms J.R. Johnson and Freddie Forest
respectively. They were joined by Grace Lee Boggs, a Chinese-American woman who
was considered the third founder. "Socialisme ou Barbarie". "Socialisme ou
Barbarie" (Socialism or Barbarism) was a French-based radical libertarian
socialist group of the post-World War II period (the name comes from a phrase
Friedrich Engels used, and was cited by Rosa Luxemburg in a 1916 essay, 'The
Junius Pamphlet'). It existed from 1948 until 1965. The animating personality
was Cornelius Castoriadis, also known as Pierre Chaulieu or Paul Cardan.
Because he explicitly both rejected Leninist vanguardism and criticised
spontaneism...(for) Cornelius Castoriadis the emancipation of the mass of
people was the task of those people; however, the socialist thinker could not
simply fold his or her arms. Castoriadis argued that the special place accorded
to the intellectual should belong to each autonomous citizen. However, he
rejected "attentisme", maintaining that, in the struggle for a new society,
intellectuals needed to ‚Äúplace themselves at a distance from the everyday and
from the real‚Äù." Situationist International. The Situationist International
was a restricted group of international revolutionaries founded in 1957, and
which had its peak in its influence on the unprecedented general wildcat
strikes of May 1968 in France. With their ideas rooted in Marxism and the 20th
century European artistic avant-gardes, they advocated experiences of life
being alternative to those admitted by the capitalist order, for the
fulfillment of human primitive desires and the pursuing of a superior passional
quality. For this purpose they suggested and experimented with the
"construction of situations", namely the setting up of environments favorable
for the fulfillment of such desires. Using methods drawn from the arts, they
developed a series of experimental fields of study for the construction of such
situations, like unitary urbanism and psychogeography. In this vein a major
theorectical work which emerged from this group was Raoul Vaneigem¬¥s "The
Revolution of Everyday Life". They fought against the main obstacle on the
fulfillment of such superior passional living, identified by them in advanced
capitalism. Their critical theoretical work peaked on the highly influential
book "The Society of the Spectacle" by Guy Debord. Debord argued in 1967 that
spectacular features like mass media and advertising have a central role in an
advanced capitalist society, which is to show a fake reality in order to mask
the real capitalist degradation of human life. To overthrow such a system, the
Situationist International supported the May '68 revolts, and asked the workers
to occupy the factories and to run them with direct democracy, through workers'
councils composed by instantly revocable delegates. After publishing in the
last issue of the magazine an analysis of the May 1968 revolts, and the
strategies that will need to be adopted in future revolutions, the SI was
dissolved in 1972. Autonomism. Autonomism refers to a set of left-wing
political and social movements and theories close to the socialist movement. As
an identifiable theoretical system it first emerged in Italy in the 1960s from
workerist ("operaismo") communism. Later, post-Marxist and anarchist tendencies
became significant after influence from the Situationists, the failure of
Italian far-left movements in the 1970s, and the emergence of a number of
important theorists including Antonio Negri, who had contributed to the 1969
founding of "Potere Operaio" as well as Mario Tronti, Paolo Virno, Franco
Berardi "Bifo" etc. Unlike other forms of Marxism, autonomist Marxism
emphasises the ability of the working class to force changes to the
organization of the capitalist system independent of the state, trade unions or
political parties. Autonomists are less concerned with party political
organization than other Marxists, focusing instead on self-organized action
outside of traditional organizational structures. Autonomist Marxism is thus a
"bottom up" theory: it draws attention to activities that autonomists see as
everyday working class resistance to capitalism, for example absenteeism, slow
working, and socialization in the workplace. Through translations made
available by Danilo Montaldi and others, the Italian autonomists drew upon
previous activist research in the United States by the Johnson‚ÄìForest
Tendency and in France by the group Socialisme ou Barbarie. It influenced the
German and Dutch Autonomen, the worldwide Social Centre movement, and today is
influential in Italy, France, and to a lesser extent the English-speaking
countries. Those who describe themselves as autonomists now vary from Marxists
to post-structuralists and anarchists. The Autonomist Marxist and "Autonomen"
movements provided inspiration to some on the revolutionary left in English
speaking countries, particularly among anarchists, many of whom have adopted
autonomist tactics. Some English-speaking anarchists even describe themselves
as "Autonomists". The Italian "operaismo" movement also influenced Marxist
academics such as Harry Cleaver, John Holloway, Steve Wright, and Nick Dyer-
Witheford. Other tendencies. This section is dedicated to post-classical
anarchist tendencies as well as tendencies which cannot be easily classified
within the anarchist/marxist division presented before. Guild socialism. Guild
socialism is a political movement advocating workers' control of industry
through the medium of trade-related guilds "in an implied contractual
relationship with the public". It originated in the United Kingdom and was at
its most influential in the first quarter of the 20th century. It was strongly
associated with G. D. H. Cole and influenced by the ideas of William Morris.
Guild socialism was partly inspired by the guilds of craftsmen and other
skilled workers which had existed in England during the Middle Ages. In 1906,
Arthur Penty published "Restoration of the Gild System" in which he opposed
factory production and advocated a return to an earlier period of artisanal
production organised through guilds. The following year, the journal "The New
Age" became an advocate of guild socialism, although in the context of modern
industry rather than the medieval setting favoured by Penty. The Guild
Socialists "stood for state ownership of industry, combined with ‚Äúworkers‚Äô
control‚Äù through delegation of authority to national guilds organized
internally on democratic lines. About the state itself they differed, some
believing it would remain more or less in its existing form and others that it
would be transformed into a federal body representing the workers‚Äô guilds,
consumers‚Äô organizations, local government bodies, and other social
structures." In 1914, S. G. Hobson, a leading contributor to "The New Age",
published "National Guilds: An Inquiry into the Wage System and the Way Out".
In this work, guilds were presented as an alternative to state-control of
industry or conventional trade union activity. Guilds, unlike the existing
trade unions, would not confine their demands to matters of wages and
conditions but would seek to obtain control of industry for the workers whom
they represented. Ultimately, industrial guilds would serve as the organs
through which industry would be organised in a future socialist society. The
theory of guild socialism was developed and popularised by G. D. H. Cole who
formed the National Guilds League in 1915 and published several books on guild
socialism, including "Self-Government in Industry" (1917) and "Guild Socialism
Restated" (1920). Revolutionary syndicalism. Revolutionary syndicalism is a
type of economic system proposed as a replacement for capitalism and an
alternative to state socialism, which uses federations of collectivised trade
unions or industrial unions. It is a form of socialist economic corporatism
that advocates interest aggregation of multiple non-competitive categorised
units to negotiate and manage an economy. For adherents, labour unions are the
potential means of both overcoming economic aristocracy and running society
fairly in the interest of the majority, through union democracy. Industry in a
syndicalist system would be run through co-operative confederations and mutual
aid. Local syndicates would communicate with other syndicates through the
Bourse du Travail (labor exchange) which would manage and transfer commodities.
Syndicalism is also used to refer to the tactic of bringing about this social
arrangement, typically expounded by anarcho-syndicalism and De Leonism, in
which a general strike begins and workers seize their means of production and
organise in a federation of trade unionism, such as the CNT. Throughout its
history, the reformist section of syndicalism has been overshadowed by its
revolutionary section, typified by the Conf√©d√©ration G√©n√©rale du Travail
(CGT) in France, IWW, the Federaci√≥n Anarquista Ib√©rica section of the CNT.,
the Unione Sindacale Italiana and the Central Organisation of the Workers of
Sweden (SAC). Christian anarchism. Christian anarchism is a movement in
political theology that combines anarchism and Christianity. It is the belief
that there is only one source of authority to which Christians are ultimately
answerable, the authority of God as embodied in the teachings of Jesus. More
than any other Bible source, the Sermon on the Mount and Jesus' call to not
resist evil but turn the other cheek, are used as the basis for Christian
anarchism. Christian anarchists are pacifists and oppose the use of violence,
such as war. The foundation of Christian anarchism is a rejection of violence,
with Leo Tolstoy's "The Kingdom of God Is Within You" regarded as a key text.
Christian anarchists denounce the state as they claim it is violent, deceitful
and, when glorified, a form of idolatry. Gandhism. Gandhism is the collection
of inspirations, principles, beliefs and philosophy of Mohandas Karamchand
Gandhi (known as Mahatma Gandhi), who was a major political and spiritual
leader of India and the Indian Independence Movement. It is a body of ideas and
principles that describes the inspiration, vision and the life work of Gandhi.
It is particularly associated with his contributions to the idea and practice
of nonviolent resistance, sometimes also called civil resistance. Gandhi's
ideas are also influential in anarcho-pacifism. Gandhian economics are the
socio-economic principles expounded by Mohandas Gandhi. It is largely
characterised by its affinity to the principles and objectives of nonviolent
humanistic socialism, but with a rejection of violent class war and promotion
of socio-economic harmony. Gandhi's economic ideas also aim to promote
spiritual development and harmony with a rejection of materialism. The term
"Gandhian economics" was coined by J. C. Kumarappa, a close supporter of
Gandhi. Gandhian economics places importance to means of achieving the aim of
development and this means must be non-violent, ethical and truthful in all
economic spheres. In order to achieve this means he advocated trusteeship,
decentralization of economic activities, labour intensive technology and
priority to weaker sections. Gandhian activists such as Vinoba Bhave and
Jayaprakash Narayan were involved in the "Sarvodaya" movement, which sought to
promote self-sufficiency amidst India's rural population by encouraging land
redistribution, socio-economic reforms and promoting cottage industries. The
movement sought to combat the problems of class conflict, unemployment and
poverty while attempting to preserve the lifestyle and values of rural Indians,
which were eroding with industrialisation and modernisation. "Sarvodaya" also
included "Bhoodan", or the gifting of land and agricultural resources by the
landlords (called "zamindars") to their tenant farmers in a bid to end the
medieval system of "zamindari". Platformism. Platfomist organizations also
founded the now defunct International Libertarian Solidarity. The website
Anarkismo.net is run collaboratively by Platformist organisations from all over
the world. Within the New Left. The emergence of the New Left in the 1950s and
1960s led to a revival of interest in libertarian socialism. The New Left's
critique of the Old Left's authoritarianism was associated with a strong
interest in personal liberty, autonomy (see the thinking of Cornelius
Castoriadis) and led to a rediscovery of older socialist traditions, such as
left communism, council communism, and the Industrial Workers of the World. The
New Left also led to a revival of anarchism. Journals like "Radical America"
and "Black Mask" in America, "Solidarity", "Big Flame" and "Democracy &
Nature", succeeded by "The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy", in
the UK, introduced a range of left libertarian ideas to a new generation.
Social ecology, autonomism and, more recently, participatory economics
(parecon), and Inclusive Democracy emerged from this. The New Left in the
United States also included anarchist, countercultural and hippie-related
radical groups such as the Yippies who were led by Abbie Hoffman and The
Diggers. By late 1966, the Diggers opened free stores which simply gave away
their stock, provided free food, distributed free drugs, gave away money,
organized free music concerts, and performed works of political art. The
Diggers took their name from the original English Diggers led by Gerrard
Winstanley and sought to create a mini-society free of money and capitalism. On
the other hand the Yippies employed theatrical gestures, such as advancing a
pig ("Pigasus the Immortal") as a candidate for President in 1968, to mock the
social status quo. They have been described as a highly theatrical, anti-
authoritarian and anarchist youth movement of "symbolic politics". Since they
were well known for street theater and politically themed pranks, many of the
"old school" political left either ignored or denounced them. According to ABC
News, "The group was known for street theater pranks and was once referred to
as the 'Groucho Marxists'." Social ecology and Communalism. Social ecology is
closely related to the work and ideas of Murray Bookchin and influenced by
anarchist Peter Kropotkin. Social ecologists assert that the present ecological
crisis has its roots in human social problems, and that the domination of
human-over-nature stems from the domination of human-over-human. Bookchin later
developed a political philosophy to complement social ecology which he called
"Communalism" (spelled with a capital "C" to differentiate it from other forms
of communalism). While originally conceived as a form of Social anarchism, he
later developed Communalism into a separate ideology which incorporates what he
saw as the most beneficial elements of Anarchism, Marxism, syndicalism, and
radical ecology. Politically, Communalists advocate a network of directly
democratic citizens' assemblies in individual communities/cities organized in a
confederal fashion. This method used to achieve this is called Libertarian
Municipalism which involves the establishment of face-to-face democratic
institutions which are to grow and expand confederally with the goal of
eventually replacing the nation-state. Unlike anarchists, Communalists are not
opposed to taking part in parliamentary politics -especially municipal
elections- as long as candidates are libertarian socialist and anti-statist in
outlook. Economically, Communalism favours the abolition of markets and money
and the transition to an economy similar to libertarian communism and according
to the principle "from each according to ability, to each according to need."
Participism. Participism is a twenty-first century form of libertarian
socialism. It comprises two related economic and political systems called
Participatory economics or "Parecon" and Participatory politics or "Parpolity".
Parecon is an economic system proposed primarily by activist and political
theorist Michael Albert and radical economist Robin Hahnel, among others. It
uses participatory decision making as an economic mechanism to guide the
production, consumption and allocation of resources in a given society.
Proposed as an alternative to contemporary capitalist market economies and also
an alternative to centrally planned socialism or coordinatorism, it is
described as "an anarchistic economic vision", and it could be considered a
form of socialism as under Parecon, the means of production are owned by the
workers. Workers' and consumers' councils utilizing self-managerial methods for
decision making, balanced job complexes, remuneration according to effort and
sacrifice, and Participatory Planning. Under Parecon, the current monetary
system would be replaced with a system of non-transferable "credit" which would
cease to exist upon purchase of a commodity. Parpolity is a theoretical
political system proposed by Stephen R. Shalom. It was developed as a political
vision to accompany Parecon. The values on which Parpolity is based are:
Freedom, self-management, justice, solidarity and tolerance. The goal,
according to Shalom, is to create a political system that will allow people to
participate, as much as possible in a face to face manner. Participism as a
whole is critical of aspects of modern representative democracies and
capitalism arguing that the level of political control by the people isn‚Äôt
sufficient. To address this problem Parpolity suggests a system of "Nested
Councils", which would include every adult member of a given society. With five
levels of nested councils it is thought, could represent the population of the
United States. Under Participism, the state as such would dissolve into a mere
coordinating body made up of delegates which would be recallable at any time by
the nested council below them. Inclusive Democracy. Inclusive Democracy is a
political theory and political project that aim for direct democracy, economic
democracy in a stateless, moneyless and marketless economy, self-management
(democracy in the social realm) and ecological democracy. The theoretical
project of Inclusive Democracy (ID)), as distinguished from the political
project which is part of the democratic and autonomy traditions, emerged from
the work of political philosopher, former academic and activist Takis
Fotopoulos in "Towards An Inclusive Democracy" and was further developed by him
and other writers in the journal "Democracy & Nature" and its successor "The
International Journal of Inclusive Democracy", an electronic journal freely
available and published by the International Network for Inclusive Democracy.
According to Arran Gare, "Towards an Inclusive Democracy" "offers a powerful
new interpretation of the history and destructive dynamics of the market and
provides an inspiring new vision of the future in place of both neo-liberalism
and existing forms of socialism". Also, as David Freeman points out, although
Fotopoulos' approach "is not openly anarchism, yet anarchism seems the formal
category within which he works, given his commitment to direct democracy,
municipalism and abolition of state, money and market economy". Insurrectionary
anarchism. Insurrectionary anarchism is a revolutionary theory, practice and
tendency within the anarchist movement which emphasizes the theme of
insurrection within anarchist practice. It is critical of formal organizations
such as labor unions and federations that are based on a political programme
and periodic congresses. Instead, insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal
organization and small affinity group based organization. Insurrectionary
anarchists put value in attack, permanent class conflict, and a refusal to
negotiate or compromise with class enemies. Contemporary insurrectionary
anarchism inherits the views and tactics of anti-organizational anarcho-
communism and illegalism. Within the labour movement and parliamentary
politics. There was a strong left-libertarian current in the British labour
movement and the term "libertarian socialist" has been applied to a number of
democratic socialists, including some prominent members of the British Labour
Party. The Socialist League was formed in 1885 by William Morris and others
critical of the authoritarian socialism of the Social Democratic Federation. It
was involved in the New Unionism, the rank and file union militancy of the
1880s‚Äì90s, which anticipated syndicalism in some key ways (Tom Mann, a New
Unionist leader, was one of the first British syndicalists). The Socialist
League was dominated by anarchists by the 1890s. The Independent Labour Party,
formed at that time, drew more on the Non-Conformist religious traditions in
the British working class than on Marxist theory, and had a libertarian
socialist strain. Others in the tradition of the ILP, and described as
libertarian socialists, have been Nye Bevan, Michael Foot and most importantly,
G. D. H. Cole. Labour Party minister Peter Hain has written in support of
libertarian socialism, identifying an axis involving a "bottom-up vision of
socialism, with anarchists at the revolutionary end and democratic socialists
as himself at its reformist end", as opposed to the axis of state socialism
with Marxist-Leninists at the revolutionary end and social democrats at the
reformist end. Another recent mainstream Labour politician who has been
described as a libertarian socialist is Robin Cook. Defined in this way,
libertarian socialism in the contemporary political mainstream is distinguished
from modern social democracy and democratic socialism principally by its
political decentralism rather than by its economics. The multi-tendency
Socialist Party USA also has a strong libertarian socialist current. Katja
Kipping and Julia Bonk in Germany, Femke Halsema in the Netherlands and Ufuk
Uras and the Freedom and Solidarity Party in Turkey, are examples of a
contemporary libertarian socialist politicians and parties operating within a
mainstream government. Communization. Communization mainly refers to a
contemporary communist theory in which we find is a "mixing-up of
insurrectionist anarchism, the communist ultra-left, postautonomists, anti-
political currents, groups like the Invisible Committee, as well as more
explicitly ‚Äòcommunizing‚Äô currents, such as "Th√©orie Communiste" and
"Endnotes". Obviously at the heart of the word is communism and, as the shift
to communization suggests, communism as a particular activity and process..."
The association of the term communization with a self-identified "ultra-left"
was cemented in France in the 1970s, where it came to describe not a transition
to a higher phase of communism but a vision of communist revolution itself.
Thus the 1975 Pamphlet "A World Without Money" states: ‚Äúinsurrection and
communisation are intimately linked. There would not be first a period of
insurrection and then later, thanks to this insurrection, the transformation of
social reality. The insurrectional process derives its force from communisation
itself.‚Äù The term is still used in this sense in France today and has spread
into English usage as a result of the translation of texts by Gilles Dauv√© and
"Th√©orie Comuniste", two key figures in this tendency. But in the late 1990s a
close but not identical sense of "communization" was developed by the French
post-situationist group Tiqqun. In keeping with their ultra-left predecessors,
Tiqqun's predilection for the term seems to be its emphasis on communism as an
immediate process rather than a far-off goal, but for Tiqqun it is no longer
synonymous with "the revolution" considered as an historical event, but rather
becomes identifiable with all sorts of activities ‚Äì from squatting and
setting up communes to simply "sharing" ‚Äì that would typically be understood
as "pre-revolutionary". From an ultra-left perspective such a politics of
"dropping-out" or, as Tiqqun put it, "desertion" ‚Äî setting up spaces and
practices that are held to partially autonomous from capitalism ‚Äî is
typically dismissed as either naive or reactionary. Due to the popularity of
the Tiqqun-related works "Call" and "The Coming Insurrection" in US anarchist
circles it tended to be this latter sense of "communization" that was employed
in US anarchist and "insurrectionist" communiques, notably within the
Californian student movement of 2009‚Äì2010. Contemporary libertarian
socialism. A surge of popular interest in libertarian socialism occurred in
western nations during the 1960s and 1970s. Anarchism was influential in the
Counterculture of the 1960s and anarchists actively participated in the late
sixties students and workers revolts. In 1968 in Carrara, Italy the
International of Anarchist Federations was founded during an international
anarchist conference held there in 1968 by the three existing European
federations of France, the Italian and the Iberian Anarchist Federation as well
as the Bulgarian federation in French exile. The uprisings of May 1968 also led
to a small resurgence of interest in left communist ideas. Various small left
communist groups emerged around the world, predominantly in the leading
capitalist countries. A series of conferences of the communist left began in
1976, with the aim of promoting international and cross-tendency discussion,
but these petered out in the 1980s without having increased the profile of the
movement or its unity of ideas. Prominent left communist groups existing today
include the International Communist Party, International Communist Current and
the Internationalist Communist Tendency. The housing and employment crisis in
most of Western Europe led to the formation of communes and squatter movements
like that of Barcelona, Spain. In Denmark, squatters occupied a disused
military base and declared the Freetown Christiania, an autonomous haven in
central Copenhagen. Around the turn of the 21st century, libertarian socialism
grew in popularity and influence as part of the anti-war, anti-capitalist, and
anti-globalisation movements. Anarchists became known for their involvement in
protests against the meetings of the World Trade Organization (WTO), Group of
Eight, and the World Economic Forum. Some anarchist factions at these protests
engaged in rioting, property destruction, and violent confrontations with
police. These actions were precipitated by ad hoc, leaderless, anonymous cadres
known as "black blocs"; other organisational tactics pioneered in this time
include security culture, affinity groups and the use of decentralised
technologies such as the internet. A significant event of this period was the
confrontations at WTO conference in Seattle in 1999. For english anarchist
scholar Simon Critchley "contemporary anarchism can be seen as a powerful
critique of the pseudo-libertarianism of contemporary neo-liberalism...One
might say that contemporary anarchism is about responsibility, whether sexual,
ecological or socio-economic; it flows from an experience of conscience about
the manifold ways in which the West ravages the rest; it is an ethical outrage
at the yawning inequality, impoverishment and disenfranchisment that is so
palpable locally and globally." International anarchist federations in
existence include the International of Anarchist Federations, the International
Workers' Association, and International Libertarian Solidarity. The largest
organised anarchist movement today is in Spain, in the form of the
Confederaci√≥n General del Trabajo (CGT) and the Confederaci√≥n Nacional del
Trabajo (CNT). CGT membership was estimated to be around 100,000 for 2003.
Other active syndicalist movements include in Sweden the Central Organisation
of the Workers of Sweden and the Swedish Anarcho-syndicalist Youth Federation;
the CNT-AIT in France; the Union Sindicale Italiana in Italy; in the US Workers
Solidarity Alliance and the UK Solidarity Federation. The revolutionary
industrial unionist Industrial Workers of the World, claiming 2,000 paying
members, and the International Workers Association, an anarcho-syndicalist
successor to the First International, also remain active. Libertarian
socialists in the early 21st century have been involved in the alter-
globalization movement, squatter movement; social centers; infoshops; anti-
poverty groups such as Ontario Coalition Against Poverty and Food Not Bombs;
tenants' unions; housing cooperatives; intentional communities generally and
egalitarian communities; anti-sexist organizing; grassroots media initiatives;
digital media and computer activism; experiments in participatory economics;
anti-racist and anti-fascist groups like Anti-Racist Action and Anti-Fascist
Action; activist groups protecting the rights of immigrants and promoting the
free movement of people, such as the No Border network; worker co-operatives,
countercultural and artist groups; and the peace movement etc. Libertarian
socialism has also more recently played a large part in the global Occupy
movement, in particular its focus on direct participatory democracy. External
