The Workmen's Circle The Workmenâ€™s Circle or Arbeter Ring
(×Ö·×¨×‘×¢×˜×¢×¨Ö¾×¨×™× ×’) is a Yiddish language-oriented American Jewish
fraternal organization committed to Social Justice, Jewish Community, and
Ashkenazic Culture. The "Arbeter Ring" provides old age homes for its aging
members, as well as schools, camps, retreats, affordable health insurance, and
year-round programs of concerts, lectures, and secular holiday celebrations.
The organization has District offices in Boston and Los Angeles, and a national
headquarters in New York. There are approximately 11,000 members nationwide.
They own and operate a summer camp located in Hopewell Junction, New York
called Camp Kinder Ring. An adult vacation facility, Circle Lodge, shares the
camp grounds and has bungalows and cottages. The Workmen's Circle is a
nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization. History. Founded in 1900, the Ring was at one
time influential in the labor movement through its participation in and
leadership of the Jewish Labor Committee. Having shrunk from the days when it
was the largest organization of its kind in the country, it is now struggling
to reinvent itself before its rapidly shrinking membership disappears
completely. While strongly socialist (Bundist) and labor-oriented at its
inception, the political perspective of the "Arbeter Ring" has moved to the
right; on the American political spectrum it would generally be described as
liberal with centrist influences and occasional conservative tendencies (e.g.,
the organization's vocal support for the Vietnam War). Today the Circle opposes
the Iraq war and unfair labor practices, and supports comprehensive immigration
reform, single-payer universal health care, gun control, and women's rights to
reproductive freedom. Publications. The newspaper affiliated with the "Arbeter
Ring", "The Forward" (×¤Ö¿×Ö¸×¨×°×¢×¨×˜×¡ "forverts"), was at one time reputed
to have had the largest national circulation of any non-English language
newspaper in the United States. "The Forward" has recently reemerged in an
English language edition (as well as a Russian version; the Yiddish version
also continues to be published) and appears to be growing in readership. For a
brief period between 2007 and 2009, all Workmen's Circle members received the
magazine Jewish Currents. Programs for young people. The Arbeter Ring runs many
shuls, or schools of Jewish culture, for elementary through middle schoolers.
Shuls emphasize the teaching of Jewish history, from Abraham onward. Jewish
culture, including klezmer music and traditional Jewish cooking, is also
emphasized, along with the Yiddish language and surrounding culture. Students
learn to sing traditional songs in Yiddish, as well as in English and Hebrew.
At the end of a student's time at shul, when he or she reaches age 12, a
secular Bar/Bas Mitzvah ceremony, called a commencement, is held. Commencement
students prepare a research paper, a family history paper, and a writeup on
community service they have performed through the year. At the group
commencement itself, students give a talk on their research topic of choice,
often also telling their family history.
