Interest Interest is a fee paid by a borrower of assets to the owner as a form
of compensation for the use of the assets. It is most commonly the price paid
for the use of borrowed money, or money earned by deposited funds. When money
is borrowed, interest is typically paid to the lender as a percentage of the
principal, the amount owed to the lender. The percentage of the principal that
is paid as a fee over a certain period of time (typically one month or year) is
called the interest rate. A bank deposit will earn interest because the bank is
paying for the use of the deposited funds. Assets that are sometimes lent with
interest include money, shares, consumer goods through hire purchase, major
assets such as aircraft, and even entire factories in finance lease
arrangements. The interest is calculated upon the value of the assets in the
same manner as upon money. Interest is compensation to the lender, for a) risk
of principal loss, called credit risk; and b) forgoing other investments that
could have been made with the loaned asset. These forgone investments are known
as the opportunity cost. Instead of the lender using the assets directly, they
are advanced to the borrower. The borrower then enjoys the benefit of using the
assets ahead of the effort required to pay for them, while the lender enjoys
the benefit of the fee paid by the borrower for the privilege. In economics,
interest is considered the price of credit. Interest is often compounded, which
means that interest is earned on prior interest in addition to the principal.
The total amount of debt grows exponentially, most notably when compounded at
infinitesimally small intervals, and its mathematical study led to the
discovery of the number "e". However, in practice, interest is most often
calculated on a daily, monthly, or yearly basis, and its impact is influenced
greatly by its compounding rate. History of interest. According to historian
Paul Johnson, the lending of "food money" was commonplace in Middle East
civilizations as far back as 5000BC. They regarded interest as legitimate since
acquired seeds and animals could "reproduce themselves"; whilst the ancient
Jewish religious prohibitions against usury were a "different view". In the
Roman Empire interest rates were usually calculated on a monthly basis and set
as multiples of 12, apparently for expedient calculation by the wealthy private
individuals that did most of the moneylending. The First Council of Nicaea, in
325, forbade clergy from engaging in usury which was defined as lending on
interest above 1 percent per month (12.7% APR). Later ecumenical councils
applied this regulation to the laity. Catholic Church opposition to interest
hardened in the era of scholastics, when even defending it was considered a
heresy. St. Thomas Aquinas, the leading theologian of the Catholic Church,
argued that the charging of interest is wrong because it amounts to "double
charging", charging for both the thing and the use of the thing. In the
medieval economy, loans were entirely a consequence of necessity (bad harvests,
fire in a workplace) and, under those conditions, it was considered morally
reproachable to charge interest. It was also considered morally dubious, since
no goods were produced through the lending of money, and thus it should not be
compensated, unlike other activities with direct physical output such as
blacksmithing or farming. For the same reason, interest has often been looked
down upon in Islamic civilization, with most scholars agreeing that the Qur'an
explicitly forbids charging interest. Medieval jurists developed several
financial instruments to encourage responsible lending and circumvent
prohibitions on usury, such as the Contractum trinius In the Renaissance era,
greater mobility of people facilitated an increase in commerce and the
appearance of appropriate conditions for entrepreneurs to start new, lucrative
businesses. Given that borrowed money was no longer strictly for consumption
but for production as well, interest was no longer viewed in the same manner.
The School of Salamanca elaborated on various reasons that justified the
charging of interest: the person who received a loan benefited, and one could
consider interest as a premium paid for the risk taken by the loaning party.
There was also the question of opportunity cost, in that the loaning party lost
other possibilities of using the loaned money. Finally and perhaps most
originally was the consideration of money itself as merchandise, and the use of
one's money as something for which one should receive a benefit in the form of
interest. MartÃ­n de Azpilcueta also considered the effect of time. Other
things being equal, one would prefer to receive a given good now rather than in
the future. This preference indicates greater value. Interest, under this
theory, is the payment for the time the loaning individual is deprived of the
money. Economically, the interest rate is the cost of capital and is subject to
the laws of supply and demand of the money supply. The first attempt to control
interest rates through manipulation of the money supply was made by the French
Central Bank in 1847. The first formal studies of interest rates and their
impact on society were conducted by Adam Smith, Jeremy Bentham and Mirabeau
during the birth of classic economic thought. In the late 19th century leading
Swedish economist Knut Wicksell in his 1898 "Interest and Prices" elaborated a
comprehensive theory of economic crises based upon a distinction between
natural and nominal interest rates. In the early 20th century, Irving Fisher
made a major breakthrough in the economic analysis of interest rates by
distinguishing nominal interest from real interest. Several perspectives on the
nature and impact of interest rates have arisen since then. The latter half of
the 20th century saw the rise of interest-free Islamic banking and finance, a
movement that attempts to apply religious law developed in the medieval period
to the modern economy. Some entire countries, including Iran, Sudan, and
Pakistan, have taken steps to eradicate interest from their financial systems
altogether. Rather than charging interest, the interest-free lender shares the
risk by investing as a partner in profit loss sharing scheme, because
predetermined loan repayment as interest is prohibited, as well as making money
out of money is unacceptable. All financial transactions must be asset-backed
and it does not charge any "fee" for the service of lending. Types of interest.
Simple interest. Simple interest is calculated only on the principal amount, or
on that portion of the principal amount that remains unpaid. where "r" is the
period interest rate (I/m), "B0" the initial balance and "mt" the number of
time periods elapsed. To calculate the period interest rate "r", one divides
the interest rate "I" by the number of periods "mt". For example, imagine that
a credit card holder has an outstanding balance of $2500 and that the simple
interest rate is 12.99% per annum. The interest added at the end of 3 months
would be, and they would have to pay $2581.19 to pay off the balance at this
point. If instead they make interest-only payments for each of those 3 months
at the period rate "r", the amount of interest paid would be, Their balance at
the end of 3 months would still be $2500. There are two complications involved
when comparing different simple interest bearing offers. A bank account that
offers only simple interest, that money can freely be withdrawn from is
unlikely, since withdrawing money and immediately depositing it again would be
advantageous. Composition of interest rates. formula_4 Where "i" is the nominal
interest, "r" is the real interest and "formula_5" is inflation. This formula
attempts to measure the value of the interest in units of stable purchasing
power. However, if this statement were true, it would imply at least two
misconceptions. First, that all interest rates within an area that shares the
same inflation (that is, the same country) should be the same. Second, that the
lenders know the inflation for the period of time that they are going to lend
the money. One reason behind the difference between the interest that yields a
treasury bond and the interest that yields a mortgage loan is the risk that the
lender takes from lending money to an economic agent. In this particular case,
a government is more likely to pay than a private citizen. Therefore, the
interest rate charged to a private citizen is larger than the rate charged to
the government. formula_6 Here, formula_7 is the nominal interest at the time
of the loan, formula_8 is the real interest expected over the period of the
loan, formula_9 is the inflation expected over the period of the loan and
formula_10 is the representative value for the risk engaged in the operation.
Cumulative interest or return. The calculation for cumulative interest is (FV/
PV)-1. It ignores the 'per year' convention and assumes compounding at every
payment date. It is usually used to compare two long term opportunities. Other
conventions and uses. Flat Rate Loans and the Rule of .78s: Some consumer loans
have been structured as flat rate loans, with the loan outstanding determined
by allocating the total interest across the term of the loan by using the "Rule
of 78s" or "Sum of digits" method. Seventy-eight is the sum of the numbers 1
through 12, inclusive. The practice enabled quick calculations of interest in
the pre-computer days. In a loan with interest calculated per the Rule of 78s,
the total interest over the life of the loan is calculated as either simple or
compound interest and amounts to the same as either of the above methods.
Payments remain constant over the life of the loan; however, payments are
allocated to interest in progressively smaller amounts. In a one-year loan, in
the first month, 12/78 of all interest owed over the life of the loan is due;
in the second month, 11/78; progressing to the twelfth month where only 1/78 of
all interest is due. The practical effect of the Rule of 78s is to make early
pay-offs of term loans more expensive. For a one year loan, approximately 3/
4 of all interest due is collected by the sixth month, and pay-off of the
principal then will cause the effective interest rate to be much higher than
the APY used to calculate the payments. In 1992, the United States outlawed the
use of "Rule of 78s" interest in connection with mortgage refinancing and other
consumer loans over five years in term. Certain other jurisdictions have
outlawed application of the Rule of 78s in certain types of loans, particularly
consumer loans. Rule of 72: The "Rule of 72" is a "quick and dirty" method for
finding out how fast money doubles for a given interest rate. For example, if
you have an interest rate of 6%, it will take 72/6 or 12 years for your money
to double, compounding at 6%. This is an approximation that starts to break
down above 10%. Market interest rates. Opportunity cost. Opportunity cost
encompasses any other use to which the money could be put, including lending to
others, investing elsewhere, holding cash (for safety, for example), and simply
spending the funds. Inflation. However interest rates are set by the market,
and it happens frequently that they are insufficient to compensate for
inflation: for example at times of high inflation during e.g. the oil crisis;
and currently (2011) when real yields on many inflation-linked government
stocks are negative. Default. There is always the risk the borrower will become
bankrupt, or otherwise default on the loan. The risk premium attempts to
measure the integrity of the borrower, the risk of his enterprise succeeding
and the security of any collateral pledged. For example, loans to developing
countries have higher risk premiums than those to the US government due to the
difference in creditworthiness. An operating line of credit to a business will
have a higher rate than a mortgage loan. The creditworthiness of businesses is
measured by bond rating services and individual's credit scores by credit
bureaus. The risks of an individual debt may have a large standard deviation of
possibilities. The lender may want to cover his maximum risk, but lenders with
portfolios of debt can lower the risk premium to cover just the most probable
outcome. Default interest. Default interest is the interest that a borrower
would pay if the borrower will not fulfill the loan covenants. The default
interest is usually much higher than the original interest since it is
reflecting the aggravation in the financial risk of the borrower. The default
interest compensates the lender for the added risk. Banks tend to add default
interest to the loan agreements in order to separate between different
scenarios. Deferred consumption. Charging interest equal only to inflation will
leave the lender with the same purchasing power, but they would prefer their
own consumption sooner rather than later. There will be an interest premium of
the delay. They may not want to consume, but instead would invest in another
product. The possible return they could realize in competing investments will
determine what interest they charge. Length of time. Shorter terms often have
less risk of default and exposure to inflation because the near future is
easier to predict. In these circumstances, short term interest rates are lower
than longer term interest rates (an upward sloping yield curve). Government
intervention. Interest rates are generally determined by the market, but
government intervention - usually by a central bank - may strongly influence
short-term interest rates, and is one of the main tools of monetary policy. The
central bank offers to borrow (or lend) large quantities of money at a rate
which they determine (sometimes this is money that they have created "ex
nihilo", i.e. printed) which has a major influence on supply and demand and
hence on market interest rates. Open market operations in the United States.
The Federal Reserve (Fed) implements monetary policy largely by targeting the
federal funds rate. This is the rate that banks charge each other for overnight
loans of federal funds. Federal funds are the reserves held by banks at the
Fed. Open market operations are one tool within monetary policy implemented by
the Federal Reserve to steer short-term interest rates. Using the power to buy
and sell treasury securities, the Open Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York can supply the market with dollars by purchasing T-notes, hence
increasing the nation's money supply. By increasing the money supply or
Aggregate Supply of Funding (ASF), interest rates will fall due to the excess
of dollars banks will end up with in their reserves. Excess reserves may be
lent in the Fed funds market to other banks, thus driving down rates. Interest
rates and credit risk. It is increasingly recognized that the business cycle,
interest rates and credit risk are tightly interrelated. The Jarrow-Turnbull
model was the first model of credit risk that explicitly had random interest
rates at its core. Lando (2004), Darrell Duffie and Singleton (2003), and van
Deventer and Imai (2003) discuss interest rates when the issuer of the
interest-bearing instrument can default. Money and inflation. Loans and bonds
have some of the characteristics of money and are included in the broad money
supply. National governments (provided, of course, that the country has
retained its own currency) can influence interest rates and thus the supply and
demand for such loans, thus altering the total of loans and bonds issued.
Generally speaking, a higher real interest rate reduces the broad money supply.
Through the quantity theory of money, increases in the money supply lead to
inflation. This means that interest rates can affect inflation in the future.
Interest in mathematics. It is thought that Jacob Bernoulli discovered the
mathematical constant e by studying a question about compound interest. He
realized that if an account that starts with $1.00 and pays say 100% interest
per year, at the end of the year, the value is $2.00; but if the interest is
computed and added twice in the year, the $1 is multiplied by 1.5 twice,
yielding $1.00Ã—1.5Â²Â =Â $2.25. Compounding quarterly yields
$1.00Ã—1.254Â =Â $2.4414â€¦, and so on. where "n" is the number of times the
interest is to be compounded in a year. Formulae. The balance of a loan with
regular monthly payments is augmented by the monthly interest charge and
decreased by the payment so where By repeated substitution one obtains
expressions for Bk, which are linearly proportional to B0 and p and use of the
formula for the partial sum of a geometric series results in A solution of this
expression for p in terms of B0 and Bn reduces to To find the payment if the
loan is to be finished in n payments one sets Bn = 0. An interest-only payment
on the current balance would be The total interest, IT, paid on the loan is The
formulas for a regular savings program are similar but the payments are added
to the balances instead of being subtracted and the formula for the payment is
the negative of the one above. These formulas are only approximate since actual
loan balances are affected by rounding. To avoid an underpayment at the end of
the loan, the payment must be rounded up to the next cent. The final payment
would then be (1+r)Bn-1. Consider a similar loan but with a new period equal to
k periods of the problem above. If rk and pk are the new rate and payment, we
now have Comparing this with the expression for Bk above we note that and The
last equation allows us to define a constant that is the same for both
problems, and Bk can be written as Solving for rk we find a formula for rk
involving known quantities and Bk, the balance after k periods, Since B0 could
be any balance in the loan, the formula works for any two balances separate by
k periods and can be used to compute a value for the annual interest rate. B*
is a scale invariant since it does not change with changes in the length of the
period. Rearranging the equation for B* one gets a transformation coefficient
(scale factor), and we see that r and p transform in the same manner, The
change in the balance transforms likewise, which gives an insight into the
meaning of some of the coefficients found in the formulas above. The annual
rate, r12, assumes only one payment per year and is not an "effective" rate for
monthly payments. With monthly payments the monthly interest is paid out of
each payment and so should not be compounded and an annual rate of 12Â·r would
make more sense. If one just made interest-only payments the amount paid for
the year would be 12Â·rÂ·B0. Substituting pk = rk B* into the equation for the
Bk we get, Since Bn = 0 we can solve for B*, Substituting back into the formula
for the Bk shows that they are a linear function of the rk and therefore the
Î»k, This is the easiest way of estimating the balances if the Î»k are known.
Substituting into the first formula for Bk above and solving for Î»k+1 we get,
Î»0 and Î»n can be found using the formula for Î»k above or computing the Î»k
recursively from Î»0 = 0 to Î»n. Since p=rB* the formula for the payment
reduces to, and the average interest rate over the period of the loan is which
is less than r if n>1. References. General references. Deepak Tiwari(Rizvi
