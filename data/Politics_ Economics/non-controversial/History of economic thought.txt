History of economic thought The history of economic thought deals with
different thinkers and theories in the subject that became political economy
and economics from the ancient world to the present day. It encompasses many
disparate schools of economic thought. Greek writers such as the philosopher
Aristotle examined ideas about the art of wealth acquisition and questioned
whether property is best left in private or public hands. In medieval times,
scholars such as Thomas Aquinas argued that it was a moral obligation of
businesses to sell goods at a just price. Scottish philosopher Adam Smith is
often cited as the father of modern economics for his treatise "The Wealth of
Nations" (1776). His ideas built upon a considerable body of work from
predecessors in the eighteenth century particularly the Physiocrats. His book
appeared on the eve of the Industrial Revolution with associated major changes
in the economy. Smith's successors included such classical economists as the
Rev. Thomas Malthus, Jean-Baptiste Say, David Ricardo, and John Stuart Mill.
They examined ways the landed, capitalist and labouring classes produced and
distributed national output and modeled the effects of population and
international trade. In London, Karl Marx castigated the capitalist system,
which he described as exploitative and alienating. From about 1870,
neoclassical economics attempted to erect a positive, mathematical and
scientifically grounded field above normative politics. After the wars of the
early twentieth century, John Maynard Keynes led a reaction against what has
been described as governmental abstention from economic affairs, advocating
interventionist fiscal policy to stimulate economic demand and growth. With a
world divided between the capitalist first world, the communist second world,
and the poor of the third world, the post-war consensus broke down. Others like
Milton Friedman and Friedrich von Hayek warned of "The Road to Serfdom" and
socialism, focusing their theories on what could be achieved through better
monetary policy and deregulation. As Keynesian policies seemed to falter in the
1970s there emerged the so-called New Classical school, with prominent
theorists such as Robert Lucas and Edward Prescott. Governmental economic
policies from the 1980s were challenged, and development economists like
Amartya Sen and information economists like Joseph Stiglitz introduced new
ideas to economic thought in the twenty-first century. Early economic thought.
The earliest discussions of economics date back to ancient times (e.g.
Chanakya's Arthashastra or Xenophon's Oeconomicus). Back then, and until the
industrial revolution, economics was not a separate discipline but part of
philosophy. In Ancient Athens, a slave based society but also one developing an
embryonic model of democracy, Plato's book "The Republic" contained references
to specialization of labour and production. But it was his pupil Aristotle that
made some of the most familiar arguments, still in economic discourse today.
Aristotle. Aristotle's "Politics" (c.a. 350 BC) was mainly concerned to analyse
different forms of a state (monarchy, aristocracy, constitutional government,
tyranny, oligarchy, democracy) as a critique of Plato's advocacy of a ruling
class of "philosopher-kings". In particular for economists, Plato had drawn a
blueprint of society on the basis of common ownership of resources. Aristotle
viewed this model as an oligarchical anathema. In "Politics", Book II, Part V,
he argued that, Though Aristotle certainly advocated there be many things held
in common, he argued that not everything could be, simply because of the
"wickedness of human nature". "It is clearly better that property should be
private", wrote Aristotle, "but the use of it common; and the special business
of the legislator is to create in men this benevolent disposition." In
"Politics" Book I, Aristotle discusses the general nature of households and
market exchanges. For him there is a certain "art of acquisition" or "wealth-
getting". Money itself has the sole purpose of being a medium of exchange,
which means on its own "it is worthless... not useful as a means to any of the
necessities of life". Nevertheless, points out Aristotle, because the
"instrument" of money is the same many people are obsessed with the simple
accumulation of money. "Wealth-getting" for one's household is "necessary and
honourable", while exchange on the retail trade for simple accumulation is
"justly censured, for it is dishonourable". Of the people he stated they as a
whole thought acquisition of wealth (chrematistike) as being either the same
as, or a principle of oikonomia ("household management" - oikonomos), with
"oikos" as house and "nomos" in fact translated as custom or law. Aristotle
himself was highly disapproving of usury and cast scorn on making money through
means of a monopoly. Middle Ages. Thomas Aquinas (1225â€“1274) was an Italian
theologian and writer on economic issues. He taught in both Cologne and Paris,
and was part of a group of Catholic scholars known as the Schoolmen, who moved
their enquiries beyond theology to philosophical and scientific debates. In the
treatise "Summa Theologica" Aquinas dealt with the concept of a just price,
which he considered necessary for the reproduction of the social order. Bearing
many similarities with the modern concept of long run equilibrium a just price
was supposed to be one just sufficient to cover the costs of production,
including the maintenance of a worker and his family. He argued it was immoral
for sellers to raise their prices simply because buyers were in pressing need
for a product. Aquinas discusses a number of topics in the format of questions
and replies, substantial tracts dealing with Aristotle's theory. Questions 77
and 78 concern economic issues, mainly relate to what a just price is, and to
the fairness of a seller dispensing faulty goods. Aquinas argued against any
form of cheating and recommended compensation always be paid in lieu of good
service. Whilst human laws might not impose sanctions for unfair dealing,
divine law did, in his opinion. One of Aquinas' main critics was Duns Scotus
(1265â€“1308) in his work "Sententiae" (1295). Originally from Duns Scotland,
he taught in Oxford, Cologne and Paris. Scotus thought it possible to be more
precise than Aquinas in calculating a just price, emphasising the costs of
labour and expenses â€“ though he recognised that the latter might be inflated
by exaggeration, because buyer and seller usually have different ideas of what
a just price comprises. If people did not benefit from a transaction, in
Scotus' view, they would not trade. Scotus defended merchants as performing a
necessary and useful social role, transporting goods and making them available
to the public. Mercantilists and nationalism. From the localism of the Middle
Ages, the waning feudal lords, new national economic frameworks began to be
strengthened. From 1492 and explorations like Christopher Columbus' voyages,
new opportunities for trade with the New World and Asia were opening. New
powerful monarchies wanted a powerful state to boost their status. Mercantilism
was a political movement and an economic theory that advocated the use of the
state's military power to ensure local markets and supply sources were
protected. Mercantile theorists thought international trade could not benefit
all countries at the same time. Because money and gold were the only source of
riches, there was a limited quantity of resources to be shared between
countries. Therefore, tariffs could be used to encourage exports (meaning more
money comes into the country) and discourage imports (sending wealth abroad).
In other words a positive balance of trade ought to be maintained, with a
surplus of exports. The term mercantilism was not in fact coined until the late
1763 by Victor de Riqueti, marquis de Mirabeau and popularised by Adam Smith,
who vigorously opposed its ideas. Thomas Mun. English businessman Thomas Mun
(1571â€“1641) represents early mercantile policy in his book "England's
Treasure by Foraign Trade" . Although it was not published until 1664 it was
widely circulated as a manuscript before then. He was a member of the East
India Company and also wrote about his experiences there in "A Discourse of
Trade from England unto the East Indies" (1621). According to Mun, trade was
the only way to increase England's treasure (i.e., national wealth) and in
pursuit of this end he suggested several courses of action. Important were
frugal consumption to increase the amount of goods available for export,
increased utilisation of land and other domestic natural resources to reduce
import requirements, lowering of export duties on goods produced domestically
from foreign materials, and the export of goods with inelastic demand because
more money could be made from higher prices. Philipp von HÃ¶rnigk. Philipp von
HÃ¶rnigk (1640â€“1712, sometimes spelt "Hornick" or "Horneck") was born in
Frankfurt am Main and became an Austrian civil servant writing in a time when
his country was constantly threatened by Ottoman invasion. In "Ã–sterreich
Ãœber Alles, Wann es Nur Will" (1684, "Austria Over All, If She Only Will") he
laid out one of the clearest statements of mercantile policy. He listed nine
principal rules of national economy. Nationalism, self-sufficiency and national
power were the basic policies proposed. Jean-Baptiste Colbert. Jean-Baptiste
Colbert (1619â€“1683) was Minister of Finance under King Louis XIV of France.
He set up national guilds to regulate major industries. Silk, linen, tapestry,
furniture manufacture and wine were examples of the crafts in which France
specialised, all of which came to require membership of a guild to operate in.
These remained until the French revolution. According to Colbert, "It is
simply, and solely, the abundance of money within a state makes the difference
in its grandeur and power." British enlightenment. Britain had gone through
some of its most troubling times through the 17th century, enduring not only
political and religious division in the English Civil War, King Charles I's
execution and the Cromwellian dictatorship, but also the plagues and fires. The
monarchy was restored under Charles II, who had catholic sympathies, but his
successor King James II was swiftly ousted. Invited in his place were
Protestant William of Orange and Mary, who assented to the Bill of Rights 1689
ensuring that the Parliament was dominant in what became known as the Glorious
revolution. The upheaval had seen a number of huge scientific advances,
including Robert Boyle's discovery of the gas pressure constant (1660) and Sir
Isaac Newton's publication of "Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica"
(1687), which described the three laws of motion and his law of universal
gravitation. All these factors spurred the advancement of economic thought. For
instance, Richard Cantillon (1680â€“1734) consciously imitated Newton's forces
of inertia and gravity in the natural world with human reason and market
competition in the economic world. In his "Essay on the Nature of Commerce in
General", he argued rational self-interest in a system of freely adjusting
markets would lead to order and mutually compatible prices. Unlike the
mercantilist thinkers however, wealth was found not in trade but in human
labour. The first person to tie these ideas into a political framework was John
Locke. John Locke. John Locke (1632â€“1704) was born near Bristol and educated
in London and Oxford. He is considered one of the most significant philosophers
of his era mainly for his critique of Thomas Hobbes' defense of absolutism in
"Leviathan" (1651) and the development of social contract theory. Locke
believed that people contracted into society which was bound to protect their
rights of property. He defined property broadly to include people's lives and
liberties, as well as their wealth. When people combined their labour with
their surroundings, then that created property rights. In his words from his
"Second Treatise on Civil Government" (1689), Locke was arguing that not only
should the government cease interference with people's property (or their
"lives, liberties and estates") but also that it should positively work to
ensure their protection. His views on price and money were laid out in a letter
to a Member of Parliament in 1691 entitled "Some Considerations on the
Consequences of the Lowering of Interest and the Raising of the Value of Money"
(1691). Here Locke argued that the "price of any commodity rises or falls, by
the proportion of the number of buyers and sellers", a rule which "holds
universally in all things that are to be bought and sold." Dudley North. Dudley
North (1641â€“1691) was a wealthy merchant and landowner. He worked as an
official for the Treasury and was opposed to most mercantile policy. In his
"Discourses upon trade" (1691), which he published anonymously, he argued that
the assumption of needing a favourable trade balance was wrong. Trade, he
argued, benefits both sides, it promotes specialisation, the division of labour
and produces an increase in wealth for everyone. Regulation of trade interfered
with these benefits by reducing the flow of wealth. David Hume. David Hume
(1711â€“1776) agreed with North's philosophy and denounced mercantile
assumptions. His contributions were set down in "Political Discourses" (1752),
later consolidated in his "Essays, Moral, Political, Literary" (1777). Added to
the fact that it was undesirable to strive for a favourable balance of trade it
is, said Hume, in any case impossible. Hume held that any surplus of exports
that might be achieved would be paid for by imports of gold and silver. This
would increase the money supply, causing prices to rise. That in turn would
cause a decline in exports until the balance with imports is restored. Francis
Hutcheson. Francis Hutcheson (1694â€“1746) was teacher to Adam Smith during
1737-1740, and is considered to be at the end of a long tradition of thought on
economics as "household or family (Î¿á¼¶ÎºÎ¿Ï‚) management", stemming from
Xenophon's work "Oeconomicus". The circular flow. Similarly disenchanted with
regulation on trademarks inspired by mercantilism, a Frenchman name Vincent de
Gournay (1712â€“1759) is reputed to have asked why it was so hard to "laissez
faire, laissez passer" (free enterprise, free trade). He was one of the early
physiocrats, a word from Greek meaning "government of nature", who held that
agriculture was the source of wealth. As historian David B. Danbom wrote, the
Physiocrats "damned cities for their artificiality and praised more natural
styles of living. They celebrated farmers." Over the end of the seventeenth and
beginning of the eighteenth century big advances in natural science and anatomy
were being made, including the discovery of blood circulation through the human
body. This concept was mirrored in the physiocrats' economic theory, with the
notion of a circular flow of income throughout the economy. FranÃ§ois Quesnay
(1694â€“1774) was the court physician to King Louis XV of France. He believed
that trade and industry were not sources of wealth, and instead in his book,
"Tableau Ã©conomique" (1758, Economic Table) argued that agricultural
surpluses, by flowing through the economy in the form of rent, wages and
purchases were the real economic movers. Firstly, said Quesnay, regulation
impedes the flow of income throughout all social classes and therefore economic
development. Secondly, taxes on the productive classes, such as farmers, should
be reduced in favour of rises for unproductive classes, such as landowners,
since their luxurious way of life distorts the income flow. Jacques Turgot
(1727â€“1781) was born in Paris and from an old Norman family. His best known
work, "RÃ©flexions sur la formation et la distribution des richesses" (1766,
"Reflections on the Formation and Distribution of Wealth") developed Quesnay's
theory that land is the only source of wealth. Turgot viewed society in terms
of three classes: the productive agricultural class, the salaried artisan class
("classe stipendice") and the landowning class ("classe disponible"). He argued
that only the net product of land should be taxed and advocated the complete
freedom of commerce and industry. In August 1774, Turgot was appointed to be
Minister of Finance and in the space of two years introduced many anti-
mercantile and anti-feudal measures supported by the King. A statement of his
guiding principles, given to the King were "no bankruptcy, no tax increases, no
borrowing." Turgot's ultimate wish was to have a single tax on land and abolish
all other indirect taxes, but measures he introduced before that were met with
overwhelming opposition from landed interests. Two edicts in particular, one
suppressing corvÃ©es (charges from farmers to aristocrats) and another
renouncing privileges given to guilds inflamed influential opinion. He was
forced from office in 1776. Adam Smith and "The Wealth of Nations". Adam Smith
(1723â€“1790) is popularly seen as the father of modern political economy. His
publication of the "An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of
Nations" in 1776 happened to coincide not only with the American Revolution,
shortly before the Europe wide upheavals of the French Revolution, but also the
dawn of a new industrial revolution that allowed more wealth to be created on a
larger scale than ever before. Smith was a Scottish moral philosopher, whose
first book was "The Theory of Moral Sentiments" (1759). He argued in it that
people's ethical systems develop through personal relations with other
individuals, that right and wrong are sensed through others' reactions to one's
behaviour. This gained Smith more popularity than his next work, "The Wealth of
Nations", which the general public initially ignored. Yet Smith's political
economic magnum opus was successful in circles that mattered. Context. William
Pitt, the Tory Prime Minister in the late 1780s based his tax proposals on
Smith's ideas and advocated free trade as a devout disciple of "The Wealth of
Nations". Smith was appointed a commissioner of customs and within twenty years
Smith had a following of new generation writers who were intent on building the
science of political economy. Smith expressed an affinity himself to the
opinions of Edmund Burke, known widely as a political philosopher, a Member of
Parliament. Burke was an established political economist himself, with his book
"Thoughts and Details on Scarcity". He was widely critical of liberal politics,
and condemned the French Revolution which began in 1789. In "Reflections on the
Revolution in France" (1790) he wrote that the "age of chivalry is dead, that
of sophisters, economists and calculators has succeeded, and the glory of
Europe is extinguished forever." Smith's contemporary influences included
FranÃ§ois Quesnay and Jacques Turgot whom he met on a stay in Paris, and David
Hume, his Scottish compatriot. The times produced a common need among thinkers
to explain social upheavals of the Industrial revolution taking place, and in
the seeming chaos without the feudal and monarchical structures of Europe, show
there was order still. The invisible hand. Smith argued for a "system of
natural liberty" where individual effort was the producer of social good. Smith
believed even the selfish within society were kept under restraint and worked
for the good of all when acting in a competitive market. Prices are often
unrepresentative of the true value of goods and services. Following John Locke,
Smith thought true value of things derived from the amount of labour invested
in them. When the butchers, the brewers and the bakers acted under the
restraint of an open market economy, their pursuit of self-interest, thought
Smith, paradoxically drives the process to correct real life prices to their
just values. His classic statement on competition goes as follows. Smith
believed that a market produced what he dubbed the "progress of opulence". This
involved a chain of concepts, that the division of labour is the driver of
economic efficiency, yet it is limited to the widening process of markets. Both
labour division and market widening requires more intensive accumulation of
capital by the entrepreneurs and leaders of business and industry. The whole
system is underpinned by maintaining the security of property rights.
Limitations. Smith's vision of a free market economy, based on secure property,
capital accumulation, widening markets and a division of labour contrasted with
the mercantilist tendency to attempt to "regulate all evil human actions."
Smith believed there were precisely three legitimate functions of government.
The third function was... In addition to the necessity of public leadership in
certain sectors Smith argued, secondly, that cartels were undesirable because
of their potential to limit production and quality of goods and services.
Thirdly, Smith criticised government support of any kind of monopoly which
always charges the highest price "which can be squeezed out of the buyers". The
existence of monopoly and the potential for cartels, which would later form the
core of competition law policy, could distort the benefits of free markets to
the advantage of businesses at the expense of consumer sovereignty. Classical
political economy. The classical economists were referred to as a group for the
first time by Karl Marx. One unifying part of their theories was the labour
theory of value, contrasting to value deriving from a general equilibrium of
supply and demand. These economists had seen the first economic and social
transformation brought by the Industrial Revolution: rural depopulation,
precariousness, poverty, apparition of a working class. They wondered about the
population growth, because the demographic transition had begun in Great
Britain at that time. They also asked many fundamental questions, about the
source of value, the causes of economic growth and the role of money in the
economy. They supported a free-market economy, arguing it was a natural system
based upon freedom and property. However, these economists were divided and did
not make up a unified current of thought. A notable current within classical
economics was underconsumption theory, as advanced by the Birmingham School and
Malthus in the early 19th century. These argued for government action to
mitigate unemployment and economic downturns, and was an intellectual
predecessor of what later became Keynesian economics in the 1930s. Another
notable school was Manchester capitalism, which advocated free trade, against
the previous policy of mercantilism. Jeremy Bentham. Jeremy Bentham
(1748â€“1832) was perhaps the most radical thinker of his time, and developed
the concept of utilitarianism. Bentham was an atheist, a prison reformer,
animal rights activist, believer in universal suffrage, free speech, free trade
and health insurance at a time when few dared to argue for any. He was schooled
rigorously from an early age, finishing university and being called to the bar
at 18. His first book, "A Fragment on Government" (1776) published anonymously
was a trenchant critique of William Blackstone's "Commentaries of the laws of
England". This gained wide success until it was found that the young Bentham,
and not a revered Professor had penned it. In "The Principles of Morals and
Legislation" (1791) Bentham set out his theory of utility. The aim of legal
policy must be to decrease misery and suffering so far as possible while
producing the greatest happiness for the greatest number. Bentham even designed
a comprehensive methodology for the calculation of aggregate happiness in
society that a particular law produced, a felicific calculus. Society, argued
Bentham, is nothing more than the total of individuals, so that if one aims to
produce net social good then one need only to ensure that more pleasure is
experienced across the board than pain, regardless of numbers. For example, a
law is proposed to make every bus in the city wheel chair accessible, but
slower moving as a result than its predecessors because of the new design.
Millions of bus users will therefore experience a small amount of displeasure
(or "pain") in increased traffic and journey times, but a minority of people
using wheel chairs will experience a huge amount of pleasure at being able to
catch public transport, which outweighs the aggregate displeasure of other
users. Interpersonal comparisons of utility were allowed by Bentham, the idea
that one person's vast pleasure can count more than many others' pain. Much
criticism later showed how this could be twisted, for instance, would the
felicific calculus allow a vastly happy dictator to outweigh the dredging
misery of his exploited populus? Despite Bentham's methodology there were
severe obstacles in measuring people's happiness. Jean-Baptiste Say. Jean-
Baptiste Say (1767â€“1832) was a Frenchman, born in Lyon who helped to
popularise Adam Smith's work in France. His book, "A Treatise on Political
Economy" (1803) contained a brief passage, which later became orthodoxy in
political economics until the Great Depression and known as Say's Law of
markets. Say argued that there could never be a general deficiency of demand or
a general glut of commodities in the whole economy. People produce things, said
Say, to fulfill their own wants, rather than those of others. Production is
therefore not a question of supply, but an indication of producers demanding
goods. Say agreed that a part of the income is saved by the households, but in
the long term, savings are invested. Investment and consumption are the two
elements of demand, so that production "is" demand, so it is impossible for
production to outrun demand, or for there to be a "general glut" of supply. Say
also argued that money was neutral, because its sole role is to facilitate
exchanges: therefore, people demand money only to buy commodities. Say said
that "money is a veil". To sum up these two ideas, Say said "products are
exchanged for products". At most, there will be different economic sectors
whose demands are not fulfilled. But over time supplies will shift, businesses
will retool for different production and the market will correct itself. An
example of a "general glut" could be unemployment, in other words, too great a
supply of workers, and too few jobs. Say's Law advocates would suggest that
this necessarily means there is an excess demand for other products that will
correct itself. This remained a foundation of economic theory until the 1930s.
Say's Law was first put forward by James Mill (1773â€“1836) in English, and was
advocated by David Ricardo, Henry Thornton and John Stuart Mill. However two
political economists, Thomas Malthus and Sismondi, were unconvinced. Thomas
Malthus. Thomas Malthus (1766â€“1834) was a Tory minister in the United Kingdom
Parliament who, contrasting to Bentham, believed in strict government
abstention from social ills. Malthus devoted the last chapter of his book
"Principles of Political Economy" (1820) to rebutting Say's law, and argued
that the economy could stagnate with a lack of "effectual demand". In other
words, wages if less than the total costs of production cannot purchase the
total output of industry and that this would cause prices to fall. Price falls
decrease incentives to invest, and the spiral could continue indefinitely.
Malthus is more notorious however for his earlier work, "An Essay on the
Principle of Population". This argued that intervention was impossible because
of two factors. "Food is necessary to the existence of man", wrote Malthus.
"The passion between the sexes is necessary and will remain nearly in its
present state", he added, meaning that the "power of the population is
infinitely greater than the power in the Earth to produce subsistence for man."
Nevertheless growth in population is checked by "misery and vice". Any increase
in wages for the masses would cause only a temporary growth in population,
which given the constraints in the supply of the Earth's produce would lead to
misery, vice and a corresponding readjustment to the original population.
However more labour could mean more economic growth, either one of which was
able to be produced by an accumulation of capital. David Ricardo. David Ricardo
(1772â€“1823) was born in London. By the age of 26, he had become a wealthy
stock market trader and bought himself a constituency seat in Ireland to gain a
platform in the British parliament's House of Commons. Ricardo's best known
work is his "Principles of Political Economy and Taxation", which contains his
critique of barriers to international trade and a description of the manner the
income is distributed in the population. Ricardo made a distinction between the
workers, who received a wage fixed to a level at which they can survive, the
landowners, who earn a rent, and capitalists, who own capital and receive a
profit, a residual part of the income. If population grows, it becomes
necessary to cultivate additional land, whose fertility is lower than that of
already cultivated fields, because of the law of decreasing productivity.
Therefore, the cost of the production of the wheat increases, as well as the
price of the wheat: The rents increase also, the wages, indexed to inflation
(because they must allow workers to survive) too. Profits decrease, until the
capitalists can no longer invest. The economy, Ricardo concluded, is bound to
tend towards a steady state. To postpone the steady state, Ricardo advocates to
promote international trade to import wheat at a low price to fight landowners.
The Corn Laws of the UK had been passed in 1815, setting a fluctuating system
of tariffs to stabilise the price of wheat in the domestic market. Ricardo
argued that raising tariffs, despite being intended to benefit the incomes of
farmers, would merely produce a rise in the prices of rents that went into the
pockets of landowners. Furthermore, extra labour would be employed leading to
an increase in the cost of wages across the board, and therefore reducing
exports and profits coming from overseas business. Economics for Ricardo was
all about the relationship between the three "factors of production": land,
labour and capital. Ricardo demonstrated mathematically that the gains from
trade could outweigh the perceived advantages of protectionist policy. The idea
of comparative advantage suggests that even if one country is inferior at
producing all of its goods than another, it may still benefit from opening its
borders since the inflow of goods produced more cheaply than at home, produces
a gain for domestic consumers. According then to Ricardo, this concept would
lead to a shift in prices, so that eventually England would be producing goods
in which its comparative advantages were the highest. John Stuart Mill. John
Stuart Mill (1806â€“1873) was the dominant figure of political economic thought
of his time, as well as being a Member of Parliament for the seat of
Westminster, and a leading political philosopher. Mill was a child prodigy,
reading Ancient Greek from the age of 3, and being vigorously schooled by his
father James Mill. Jeremy Bentham was a close mentor and family friend, and
Mill was heavily influenced by David Ricardo. Mill's textbook, first published
in 1848 and titled "Principles of Political Economy" was essentially a summary
of the economic wisdom of the mid nineteenth century. "Principles of Political
Economy" was used as the standard texts by most universities well into the
beginning of the twentieth century. On the question of economic growth Mill
tried to find a middle ground between Adam Smith's view of ever expanding
opportunities for trade and technological innovation and Thomas Malthus' view
of the inherent limits of population. In his fourth book Mill set out a number
of possible future outcomes, rather than predicting one in particular. The
first followed the Malthusian line that population grew quicker than supplies,
leading to falling wages and rising profits. The second, per Smith, said if
capital accumulated faster than population grew then real wages would rise.
Third, echoing David Ricardo, should capital accumulate and population increase
at the same rate, yet technology stay stable, there would be no change in real
wages because supply and demand for labour would be the same. However growing
populations would require more land use, increasing food production costs and
therefore decreasing profits. The fourth alternative was that technology
advanced faster than population and capital stock increased. The result would
be a prospering economy. Mill felt the third scenario most likely, and he
assumed technology advanced would have to end at some point. But on the
prospect of continuing economic growth, Mill was more ambivalent. Mill is also
credited with being the first person to speak of supply and demand as a
relationship rather than mere quantities of goods on markets, the concept of
opportunity cost and the rejection of the wage fund doctrine. Capitalism and
Marx. Just as the term "mercantilism" had been coined and popularised by its
critics, like Adam Smith, so was the term "capitalism" or "Kapitalismus" used
by its dissidents, primarily Karl Marx. Karl Marx (1818â€“1883) was, and in
many ways still remains the pre-eminent socialist economist. His combination of
political theory represented in the "Communist Manifesto" and the dialectic
theory of history inspired by Friedrich Hegel provided a revolutionary critique
of capitalism as he saw it in the nineteenth century. The socialist movement
that he joined had emerged in response to the conditions of people in the new
industrial era and the classical economics which accompanied it. He wrote his
magnum opus "Das Kapital" at the British Museum's library. Context. Robert Owen
(1771â€“1858) was one industrialist who determined to improve the conditions of
his workers. He bought textile mills in New Lanark, Scotland where he forbade
children under ten to work, set the workday from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. and provided
evening schools for children when they finished. Such meagre measures were
still substantial improvements and his business remained solvent through higher
productivity, though his pay rates were lower than the national average. He
published his vision in "The New View of Society" (1816) during the passage of
the Factory Acts, but his attempt from 1824 to begin a new utopian community in
New Harmony, Indiana ended in failure. One of Marx's own influences was the
French anarchist/socialist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. While deeply critical of
capitalism and in favour of workers' associations to replace it, he also
objected to those contemporary socialists who idolized centralised state-run
association. In "System of Economic Contradictions" (1846) Proudhon made a
wide-ranging critique of capitalism, analysing the contradictory effects of
machinery, competition, property, monopoly and other aspects of the economy.
Instead of capitalism, he argued for a mutualist system "based upon equality,
â€“ in other words, the organisation of labour, which involves the negation of
political economy and the end of property." In his book "What is Property?"
(1840) he argue that property is theft, a different view than the classical
Mill, who had written that "partial taxation is a mild form of robbery".
However, towards the end of his life, Proudhon modified some of his earlier
views. In the posthumously published "Theory of Property", he argued that
"property is the only power that can act as a counterweight to the State."
Friedrich Engels, a published radical author, released a book titled "The
Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844" describing people's
positions as "the most unconcealed pinnacle of social misery in our day." After
Marx died, it was Engels that completed the second volume of "Das Kapital" from
Marx's notes. "Das Kapital". Karl Marx begins "Das Kapital" with the concept of
commodities. Before capitalist societies, says Marx, the mode of production was
based on slavery (e.g. in ancient Rome) before moving to feudal serfdom (e.g.
in mediaeval Europe). As society has advanced, economic bondage has become
looser, but the current nexus of labour exchange has produced an equally
erratic and unstable situation allowing the conditions for revolution. People
buy and sell their labour in the same way as people buy and sell goods and
services. People themselves are disposable commodities. As he wrote in the
"Communist Manifesto", And furthermore from the first page of "Das Kapital",
Marx's use of the word "commodity" is tied into an extensive metaphysical
discussion of the nature of material wealth, how the objects of wealth are
perceived and how they can be used. The concept of a commodity contrasts to
objects of the natural world. When people mix their labour with an object it
becomes a "commodity". In the natural world there are trees, diamonds, iron ore
and people. In the economic world they become chairs, rings, factories and
workers. However, says Marx, commodities have a dual nature, a dual value. He
distinguishes the use value of a thing from its exchange value, which can be
entirely different. The use value of a thing derives from the amount of labour
used to produce it, says Marx, following the classical economists in the labour
theory of value. However, Marx did not believe labour only was the source of
use value in things. He believed value can derive too from natural goods and
refined his definition of use value to "socially necessary labour time" (the
time people need to produce things when they are not lazy or inefficient).
Furthermore, people subjectively inflate the value of things, for instance
because there's a commodity fetish for glimmering diamonds, and oppressive
power relations involved in commodity production. These two factors mean
exchange values differ greatly. An oppressive power relation, says Marx
applying the use/exchange distinction to labour itself, in work-wage bargains
derives from the fact that employers pay their workers less in "exchange value"
than the workers produce in "use value". The difference makes up the
capitalist's profit, or in Marx's terminology, "surplus value". Therefore, says
Marx, capitalism is a system of exploitation. Marx's work turned the labour
theory of value, as the classicists used it, on its head. His dark irony goes
deeper by asking what is the socially necessary labour time for the production
of labour (i.e. working people) itself. Marx answers that this is the bare
minimum for people to subsist and to reproduce with skills necessary in the
economy. People are therefore alienated from both the fruits of production and
the means to realise their potential, psychologically, by their oppressed
position in the labour market. But the tale told alongside exploitation and
alienation is one of capital accumulation and economic growth. Employers are
constantly under pressure from market competition to drive their workers
harder, and at the limits invest in labour displacing technology (e.g. an
assembly line packer for a robot). This raises profits and expands growth, but
for the sole benefit of those who have private property in these means of
production. The working classes meanwhile face progressive immiseration, having
had the product of their labour exploited from them, having been alienated from
the tools of production. And having been fired from their jobs for machines,
they end unemployed. Marx believed that a reserve army of the unemployed would
grow and grow, fuelling a downward pressure on wages as desperate people accept
work for less. But this would produce a deficit of demand as the people's power
to purchase products lagged. There would be a glut in unsold products,
production would be cut back, profits decline until capital accumulation halts
in an economic depression. When the glut clears, the economy again starts to
boom before the next cyclical bust begins. With every boom and bust, with every
capitalist crisis, thought Marx, tension and conflict between the increasingly
polarised classes of capitalists and workers heightens. Moreover smaller firms
are being gobbled by larger ones in every business cycle, as power is
concentrated in the hands of the few and away from the many. Ultimately, led by
the Communist party, Marx envisaged a revolution and the creation of a
classless society. How this may work, Marx never suggested. His primary
contribution was not in a blue print for how society would be, but a criticism
of what he saw it was. After Marx. The first volume of "Das Kapital" was the
only one Marx alone published. The second and third volumes were done with the
help of Friedrich Engels, and Karl Kautsky, who had become a friend of Engels,
saw through the publication of volume four. Marx had begun a tradition of
economists who concentrated equally on political affairs. Also in Germany, Rosa
Luxemburg was a member of the SPD, who later turned towards the Communist Party
because of their stance against the First World War. Beatrice Webb in England
was a socialist, who helped found both the London School of Economics (LSE) and
the Fabian Society. Neoclassical thought. In the 1860s, a revolution took place
in economics. The new ideas were that of the Marginalist school. Writing
simultaneously and independently, a Frenchman (LÃ©on Walras), an Austrian (Carl
Menger) and an Englishman (Stanley Jevons) were developing the theory, which
had some antecedents. Instead of the price of a good or service reflecting the
labor that has produced it, it reflects the marginal usefulness (utility) of
the last purchase. This meant that in equilibrium, people's preferences
determined prices, including, indirectly the price of labor. This current of
thought was not united, and there were three main schools working
independently. The Lausanne school, whose two main representants were Walras
and Vilfredo Pareto, developed the theories of general equilibrium and
optimality. The main written work of this school was Walras' "Elements of Pure
Economics". The Cambridge school appeared with Jevons' "Theory of Political
Economy" in 1871. This English school has developed the theories of the partial
equilibrium and has insisted on markets' failures. The main representatives
were Alfred Marshall, Stanley Jevons and Arthur Pigou. The Vienna school was
made up of Austrian economists Menger, Eugen von BÃ¶hm-Bawerk and Friedrich von
Wieser. They developed the theory of capital and has tried to explain the
presence of economic crises. It appeared in 1871 with Menger's "Principles of
Economics". Marginal utility. Carl Menger (1840â€“1921), an Austrian economist
stated the basic principle of marginal utility in "GrundsÃ¤tze der
Volkswirtschaftslehre" (1871, "Principles of Economics"). Consumers act
rationally by seeking to maximise satisfaction of all their preferences. People
allocate their spending so that the last unit of a commodity bought creates no
more than a last unit bought of something else. Stanley Jevons (1835â€“1882)
was his English counterpart, and worked as tutor and later professor at Owens
College, Manchester and University College, London. He emphasised in the
"Theory of Political Economy" (1871) that at the margin, the satisfaction of
goods and services decreases. An example of the theory of diminishing returns
is that for every orange one eats, the less pleasure one gets from the last
orange (until one stops eating). Then LÃ©on Walras (1834â€“1910), again working
independently, generalised marginal theory across the economy in "Elements of
Pure Economics" (1874). Small changes in people's preferences, for instance
shifting from beef to mushrooms, would lead to a mushroom price rise, and beef
price fall. This stimulates producers to shift production, increasing
mushrooming investment, which would increase market supply and a new price
equilibrium between the products â€“ e.g. lowering the price of mushrooms to a
level between the two first levels. For many products across the economy the
same would go, "if" one assumes markets are competitive, people choose on self-
interest and no cost in shifting production. Early attempts to explain away the
periodical crises of which Marx had spoken were not initially as successful.
After finding a statistical correlation of sunspots and business fluctuations
and following the common belief at the time that sunspots had a direct effect
on weather and hence agricultural output, Stanley Jevons wrote, Mathematical
analysis. Vilfredo Pareto (1848â€“1923) was an Italian economist, best known
for developing the concept of an economy that would permit maximizing the
utility level of each individual, given the feasible utility level of others
from production and exchange. Such a result came to be called "Pareto
efficient". Pareto devised mathematical representations for such a resource
allocation, notable in abstracting from institutional arrangements and monetary
measures of wealth or income distribution.Â Â Â â€¢ Pareto (1897). "Cours
d'Ã©conomie politique", v. 2.Â Â Â â€¢ Pareto ( 1971). "Manual of Political
Economy", ch. 6, Mathematical Appendix, sect. 145-52. Translation of French
edition from 1927. Alfred Marshall is also credited with an attempt to put
economics on a more mathematical footing. He was the first Professor of
Economics at the University of Cambridge and his work, "Principles of
Economics" coincided with the transition of the subject from "political
economy" to his favoured term, "economics". He viewed maths as a way to
simplify economic reasoning, though had reservations, revealed in a letter to
his student Arthur Cecil Pigou. Coming after the marginal revolution, Marshall
concentrated on reconciling the classical labour theory of value, which had
concentrated on the supply side of the market, with the new marginalist theory
that concentrated on the consumer demand side. Marshalls graphical
representation is the famous supply and demand graph, the "Marshallian cross".
He insisted it is the intersection of "both" supply "and" demand that produce
an equilibrium of price in a competitive market. Over the long run, argued
Marshall, the costs of production and the price of goods and services tend
towards the lowest point consistent with continued production. Arthur Cecil
Pigou in "Wealth and Welfare" (1920), insisted on the existence of market
failures. Markets are inefficient in case of economic externalities, and the
State must interfere. However, Pigou retained free-market beliefs, and in 1933,
in the face of the economic crisis, he explained in "The Theory of
Unemployment" that the excessive intervention of the state in the labor market
was the real cause of massive unemployment, because the governments had
established a minimal wage, which prevented the wages from adjusting
automatically. This was to be the focus of attack from Keynes. Austrian school.
While the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth were
dominated increasingly by mathematical analysis, the followers of Carl Menger,
in the tradition of Eugen von BÃ¶hm-Bawerk, followed a different route,
advocating the use of deductive logic instead. This group became known as the
Austrian School, reflecting the Austrian origin of many of the early adherents.
Thorstein Veblen in 1900, in his "Preconceptions of Economic Science",
contrasted neoclassical marginalists in the tradition of Alfred Marshall from
the philosophies of the Austrian school. Joseph Alois Schumpeter (1883â€“1950)
was an Austrian economist and political scientist most known for his works on
business cycles and innovation. He insisted on the role of the entrepreneurs in
an economy. In "Business Cycles: A theoretical, historical and statistical
analysis of the Capitalist process"(1939), Schumpeter made a synthesis of the
theories about business cycles. He suggested that those cycles could explain
the economic situations. According to Schumpeter, capitalism necessarily goes
through long-term cycles, because it is entirely based upon scientific
inventions and innovations. A phase of expansion is made possible by
innovations, because they bring productivity gains and encourage entrepreneurs
to invest. However, when investors have no more opportunities to invest, the
economy goes into recession, several firms collapse, closures and bankruptcy
occur. This phase lasts until new innovations bring a creative destruction
process, i.e. they destroy old products, reduce the employment, but they allow
the economy to start a new phase of growth, based upon new products and new
factors of production. Ludwig von Mises (1881â€“1973) was an Austrian economist
who contributed the idea of praxeology, "The science of human action".
Praxeology views economics as a series of voluntary trades that increase the
satisfaction of the involved parties. Mises also argued that socialism suffers
from an unsolvable economic calculation problem, which according to him, could
only be solved through free market price mechanisms. Mises' outspoken
criticisms of socialism had a large influence on the economic thinking of
Friedrich von Hayek (1899â€“1992), who, while initially sympathetic to
socialism, became one of the leading academic critics of collectivism in the
20th century. In echoes of Smith's "system of natural liberty", Hayek argued
that the market is a "spontaneous order" and actively disparaged the concept of
"social justice". Hayek believed that all forms of collectivism (even those
theoretically based on voluntary cooperation) could only be maintained by a
central authority. In his book, "The Road to Serfdom" (1944) and in subsequent
works, Hayek claimed that socialism required central economic planning and that
such planning in turn would lead towards totalitarianism. Hayek attributed the
birth of civilization to private property in his book "The Fatal Conceit"
(1988). According to him, price signals are the only means of enabling each
economic decision maker to communicate tacit knowledge or dispersed knowledge
to each other, to solve the economic calculation problem. Along with his
contemporary Gunnar Myrdal, Hayek was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1974.
Depression and reconstruction. Alfred Marshall was still working on his last
revisions of his "Principles of Economics" at the outbreak of the First World
War (1914â€“1918). The new twentieth century's climate of optimism was soon
violently dismembered in the trenches of the Western front, as the civilised
world tore itself apart. For four years the production of Britain, Germany and
France was geared entirely towards the war economy's industry of death. In 1917
Russia crumbled into revolution led by Vladimir Lenin's Bolshevik party. They
carried Marxist theory as their saviour, and promised a broken country "peace,
bread and land" by collectivising the means of production. Also in 1917, the
United States of America entered the war on the side of France and Britain,
President Woodrow Wilson carrying the slogan of "making the world safe for
democracy". He devised a peace plan of Fourteen Points. In 1918 Germany
launched a spring offensive which failed, and as the allies counter-attacked
and more millions were slaughtered, Germany slid into revolution, its interim
government suing for peace on the basis of Wilson's Fourteen Points. Europe lay
in ruins, financially, physically, psychologically, and its future with the
arrangements of the Versailles conference in 1919. John Maynard Keynes was the
representative of Her Majesty's Treasury at the conference and the most vocal
critic of its outcome. John Maynard Keynes. John Maynard Keynes (1883â€“1946)
was born in Cambridge, educated at Eton and supervised by both A. C. Pigou and
Alfred Marshall at Cambridge University. He began his career as a lecturer,
before working in the British government during the Great War, and rose to be
the British government's financial representative at the Versailles conference.
His observations were laid out in his book "The Economic Consequences of the
Peace" (1919) where he documented his outrage at the collapse of the Americans'
adherence to the Fourteen Points and the mood of vindictiveness that prevailed
towards Germany. Keynes quit from the conference and using extensive economic
data provided by the conference records, Keynes argued that if the victors
forced war reparations to be paid by the defeated Axis, then a world financial
crisis would ensue, leading to a second world war. Keynes finished his treatise
by advocating, first, a reduction in reparation payments by Germany to a
realistically manageable level, increased intra-governmental management of
continental coal production and a free trade union through the League of
Nations; second, an arrangement to set off debt repayments between the Allied
countries; third, complete reform of international currency exchange and an
international loan fund; and fourth, a reconciliation of trade relations with
Russia and Eastern Europe. The book was an enormous success, and though it was
criticised for false predictions by a number of people, without the changes he
advocated, Keynes' dark forecasts matched the world's experience through the
Great Depression which ensued in 1929, and the descent into a new outbreak of
war in 1939. World War I had been the "war to end all wars", and the absolute
failure of the peace settlement generated an even greater determination to not
repeat the same mistakes. With the defeat of fascism, the Bretton Woods
conference was held to establish a new economic order. Keynes was again to play
a leading role. "The General Theory". During the Great Depression, Keynes had
published his most important work, "The General Theory of Employment, Interest,
and Money" (1936). The depression had been sparked by the Wall Street Crash of
1929, leading to massive rises in unemployment in the United States, leading to
debts being recalled from European borrowers, and an economic domino effect
across the world. Orthodox economics called for a tightening of spending, until
business confidence and profit levels could be restored. Keynes by contrast,
had argued in "A Tract on Monetary Reform" (1923) that a variety of factors
determined economic activity, and that it was not enough to wait for the long
run market equilibrium to restore itself. As Keynes famously remarked, On top
of the supply of money, Keynes identified the propensity to consume, inducement
to invest, the marginal efficiency of capital, liquidity preference and the
multiplier effect as variables which determine the level of the economy's
output, employment and level of prices. Much of this esoteric terminology was
invented by Keynes especially for his "General Theory", though some simple
ideas lay behind. Keynes argued that if savings were being kept away from
investment through financial markets, total spending falls. Falling spending
leads to reduced incomes and unemployment, which reduces savings again. This
continues until the desire to save becomes equal to the desire to invest, which
means a new "equilibrium" is reached and the spending decline halts. This new
"equilibrium" is a depression, where people are investing less, have less to
save and less to spend. Keynes argued that employment depends on total
spending, which is composed of consumer spending and business investment in the
private sector. Consumers only spend "passively", or according to their income
fluctuations. Businesses, on the other hand, are induced to invest by the
expected rate of return on new investments (the benefit) and the rate of
interest paid (the cost). So, said Keynes, if business expectations remained
the same, and government reduces interest rates (the costs of borrowing),
investment would increase, and would have a multiplied effect on total
spending. Interest rates, in turn, depend on the quantity of money and the
desire to hold money in bank accounts (as opposed to investing). If not enough
money is available to match how much people want to hold, interest rates rise
until enough people are put off. So if the quantity of money were increased,
while the desire to hold money remained stable, interest rates would fall,
leading to increased investment, output and employment. For both these reasons,
Keynes therefore advocated low interest rates and easy credit, to combat
unemployment. But Keynes believed in the 1930s, conditions necessitated public
sector action. Deficit spending, said Keynes, would kick-start economic
activity. This he had advocated in an open letter to U.S. President Franklin D.
Roosevelt in the "New York Times" (1933). The New Deal programme in the U.S.
had been well underway by the publication of the "General Theory". It provided
conceptual reinforcement for policies already pursued. Keynes also believed in
a more egalitarian distribution of income, and taxation on unearned income
arguing that high rates of savings (to which richer folk are prone) are not
desirable in a developed economy. Keynes therefore advocated both monetary
management and an active fiscal policy. Keynesian economics. During the Second
World War, Keynes acted as advisor to HM Treasury again, negotiating major
loans from the US. He helped formulate the plans for the International Monetary
Fund, the World Bank and an International Trade Organisation at the Bretton
Woods conference, a package designed to stabilise world economy fluctuations
that had occurred in the 1920s and create a level trading field across the
globe. Keynes passed away little more than a year later, but his ideas had
already shaped a new global economic order, and all Western governments
followed the Keynesian prescription of deficit spending to avert crises and
maintain full employment. One of Keynes' pupils at Cambridge was Joan Robinson,
who contributed to the notion that competition is seldom perfect in a market,
an indictment of the theory of markets setting prices. In "The Production
Function and the Theory of Capital" (1953) Robinson tackled what she saw to be
some of the circularity in orthodox economics. Neoclassicists assert that a
competitive market forces producers to minimise the costs of production.
Robinson said that costs of production are merely the prices of inputs, like
capital. Capital goods get their value from the final products. And if the
price of the final products determines the price of capital, then it is, argued
Robinson, utterly circular to say that the price of capital determines the
price of the final products. Goods cannot be priced until the costs of inputs
are determined. This would not matter if everything in the economy happened
instantaneously, but in the real world, price setting takes time â€“ goods are
priced before they are sold. Since capital cannot be adequately valued in
independently measurable units, how can one show that capital earns a return
equal to the contribution to production? Piero Sraffa came to England from
fascist Italy in the 1920s, and worked with Keynes in Cambridge. In 1960 he
published a small book called "Production of Commodities by Means of
Commodities", which explained how technological relationships are the basis for
production of goods and services. Prices result from wage-profit tradeoffs,
collective bargaining, labour and management conflict and the intervention of
government planning. Like Robinson, Sraffa was showing how the major force for
price setting in the economy was not necessarily market adjustments. The
"American Way". After World War II, the United States had become the pre-
eminent global economic power. Europe and the Soviet Union lay in ruins and the
British Empire was at its end. Until then, American economists had played a
minor role. The institutional economists had been largely critical of the
"American Way" of life, especially regarding conspicuous consumption of the
Roaring Twenties before the Wall Street Crash of 1929. After the war, however,
a more orthodox body of thought took root, reacting against the lucid debating
style of Keynes, and re-mathematizing the profession. The orthodox centre was
also challenged by a more radical group of scholars based at the University of
Chicago. They advocated "liberty" and "freedom", looking back to 19th century-
style non-interventionist governments. Institutionalism. Thorsten Veblen
(1857â€“1929), who came from rural mid-western America and worked at the
University of Chicago, is one of the best known early critics of the "American
Way". In "The Theory of the Leisure Class" (1899) he scorned materialistic
culture and wealthy people who conspicuously consumed their riches as a way of
demonstrating success and in "The Theory of Business Enterprise" (1904) Veblen
distinguished production for people to use things and production for pure
profit, arguing that the former is often hindered because businesses pursue the
latter. Output and technological advance are restricted by business practices
and the creation of monopolies. Businesses protect their existing capital
investments and employ excessive credit, leading to depressions and increasing
military expenditure and war through business control of political power. These
two books, focusing on criticism first of consumerism, and second of
profiteering, did not advocate change. However, in 1911, Veblen joined the
faculty of the University of Missouri, where he had support from Herbert
Davenport, the head of the economics department. Veblen remained at Columbia,
Missouri through 1918. In that year, he moved to New York to begin work as an
editor of a magazine called "The Dial", and then in 1919, along with Charles A.
Beard, James Harvey Robinson and John Dewey, helped found the New School for
Social Research (known today as The New School). He was also part of the
Technical Alliance, created in 1919 by Howard Scott. From 1919 through 1926
Veblen continued to write and to be involved in various activities at The New
School. During this period he wrote "The Engineers and the Price System (1921).
John R. Commons (1862â€“1945) also came from mid-Western America. Underlying
his ideas, consolidated in "Institutional Economics" (1934) was the concept
that the economy is a web of relationships between people with diverging
interests. There are monopolies, large corporations, labour disputes and
fluctuating business cycles. They do however have an interest in resolving
these disputes. Government, thought Commons, ought to be the mediator between
the conflicting groups. Commons himself devoted much of his time to advisory
and mediation work on government boards and industrial commissions. The Great
Depression was a time of significant upheaval in the States. One of the most
original contributions to understanding what had gone wrong came from a Harvard
University lawyer, named Adolf Berle (1895â€“1971), who like John Maynard
Keynes had resigned from his diplomatic job at the Paris Peace Conference, 1919
and was deeply disillusioned by the Versailles Treaty. In his book with
Gardiner C. Means, "The Modern Corporation and Private Property" (1932), he
detailed the evolution in the contemporary economy of big business, and argued
that those who controlled big firms should be better held to account. Directors
of companies are held to account to the shareholders of companies, or not, by
the rules found in company law statutes. This might include rights to elect and
fire the management, require for regular general meetings, accounting
standards, and so on. In 1930s America, the typical company laws (e.g. in
Delaware) did not clearly mandate such rights. Berle argued that the
unaccountable directors of companies were therefore apt to funnel the fruits of
enterprise profits into their own pockets, as well as manage in their own
interests. The ability to do this was supported by the fact that the majority
of shareholders in big public companies were single individuals, with scant
means of communication, in short, divided and conquered. Berle served in
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's administration through the depression,
and was a key member of the so-called "Brain trust" developing many of the New
Deal policies. In 1967, Berle and Means issued a revised edition of their work,
in which the preface added a new dimension. It was not only the separation of
controllers of companies from the owners as shareholders at stake. They posed
the question of what the corporate structure was really meant to achieve. John
Kenneth Galbraith. After the war, John Kenneth Galbraith (1908â€“2006) became
one of the standard bearers for pro-active government and liberal-democrat
politics. In "The Affluent Society" (1958), Galbraith argued voters reaching a
certain material wealth begin to vote against the common good. He argued that
the "conventional wisdom" of the conservative consensus was not enough to solve
the problems of social inequality. In an age of big business, he argued, it is
unrealistic to think of markets of the classical kind. They set prices and use
advertising to create artificial demand for their own products, distorting
people's real preferences. Consumer preferences actually come to reflect those
of corporationsâ€”a "dependence effect"â€”and the economy as a whole is geared
to irrational goals. In "The New Industrial State" Galbraith argued that
economic decisions are planned by a private-bureaucracy, a technostructure of
experts who manipulate marketing and public relations channels. This hierarchy
is self-serving, profits are no longer the prime motivator, and even managers
are not in control. Because they are the new planners, corporations detest
risk, require steady economic and stable markets. They recruit governments to
serve their interests with fiscal and monetary policy, for instance adhering to
monetarist policies which enrich money-lenders in the City through increases in
interest rates. While the goals of an affluent society and complicit government
serve the irrational technostructure, public space is simultaneously
impoverished. Galbraith paints the picture of stepping from penthouse villas
onto unpaved streets, from landscaped gardens to unkempt public parks. In
"Economics and the Public Purpose" (1973) Galbraith advocates a "new socialism"
as the solution, nationalising military production and public services such as
health care, introducing disciplined salary and price controls to reduce
inequality. Paul Samuelson. In contrast to Galbraith's linguistic style, the
post-war economics profession began to synthesise much of Keynes' work with
mathematical representations. Introductory university economics courses began
to present economic theory as a unified whole in what is referred to as the
neoclassical synthesis. "Positive economics" became the term created to
describe certain trends and "laws" of economics that could be objectively
observed and described in a value-free way, separate from "normative economic"
evaluations and judgments. The best selling textbook writer of this generation
was Paul Samuelson (1915â€“2009). His Ph.D. dissertation was an attempt to show
that mathematical methods could represent a core of testable economic theory.
It was published as "Foundations of Economic Analysis" in 1947. Samuelson
started with two assumptions. First, people and firms will act to maximise
their self-interested goals. Second, markets tend towards an equilibrium of
prices, where demand matches supply. He extended the mathematics to describe
equilibrating behaviour of economic systems, including that of the then new
macroeconomic theory of John Maynard Keynes. Whilst Richard Cantillon had
imitated Isaac Newton's mechanical physics of inertia and gravity in
competition and the market, the physiocrats had copied the body's blood system
into circular flow of income models, William Jevons had found growth cycles to
match the periodicity of sunspots, Samuelson adapted thermodynamics formulae to
economic theory. Reasserting economics as a hard science was being done in the
United Kingdom also, and one celebrated "discovery", of A. W. Phillips, was of
a correlative relationship between inflation and unemployment. The workable
policy conclusion was that securing full employment could be traded-off against
higher inflation. Samuelson incorporated the idea of the Phillips curve into
his work. His introductory textbook "Economics" was influential and widely
adopted. It became the most successful economics text ever. Paul Samuelson was
awarded the new Nobel Prize in Economics in 1970 for his merging of mathematics
and political economy. Kenneth Arrow. Kenneth Arrow (born 1921) is Paul
Samuelson's brother-in-law. His first major work, forming his doctoral
dissertation at Columbia University was "Social Choice and Individual Values"
(1951), which brought economics into contact with political theory. This gave
rise to social choice theory with the introduction of his "Possibility
Theorem". In his words, This sparked widespread discussion over how to
interpret the different conditions of the theorem and what implications it had
for democracy and voting. Most controversial of his four (1963) or five (1950/
1951) conditions is the independence of irrelevant alternatives. In the 1950s,
Arrow and GÃ©rard Debreu developed the Arrowâ€“Debreu model of general
equilibria. In 1971 Arrow with Frank Hahn co-authored "General Competitive
Analysis" (1971), which reasserted a theory of general equilibrium of prices
through the economy. In 1969 the Swedish Central Bank began awarding a prize in
economics, as an analogy to the Nobel prizes awarded in Chemistry, Physics,
Medicine as well as Literature and Peace (though Alfred Nobel never endorsed
this in his will). With John Hicks, Arrow won the Bank of Sweden prize in 1972,
the youngest recipient ever. The year before, US President Richard Nixon's had
declared that "We are all Keynesians now". The irony was that this was the
beginning of a new revolution in economic thought. Monetarism and the Chicago
school. The interventionist monetary and fiscal policies that the orthodox
post-war economics recommended came under attack in particular by a group of
theorists working at the University of Chicago, which came to be known as the
Chicago School. This more conservative strand of thought reasserted a
"libertarian" view of market activity, that people are best left to themselves,
free to choose how to conduct their own affairs. Ronald Coase. Ronald Coase
(born 1910) is the most prominent economic analyst of law and the 1991 Nobel
Prize winner. His first major article, "The Nature of the Firm" (1937), argued
that the reason for the existence of firms (companies, partnerships, etc.) is
the existence of transaction costs. Rational individuals trade through
bilateral contracts on open markets until the costs of transactions mean that
using corporations to produce things is more cost-effective. His second major
article, "The Problem of Social Cost" (1960), argued that if we lived in a
world without transaction costs, people would bargain with one another to
create the same allocation of resources, regardless of the way a court might
rule in property disputes. Coase used the example of an old legal case about
nuisance named "Sturges v Bridgman", where a noisy sweetmaker and a quiet
doctor were neighbours and went to court to see who should have to move. Coase
said that regardless of whether the judge ruled that the sweetmaker had to stop
using his machinery, or that the doctor had to put up with it, they could
strike a mutually beneficial bargain about who moves house that reaches the
same outcome of resource distribution. Only the existence of transaction costs
may prevent this. So the law ought to pre-empt what "would" happen, and be
guided by the most efficient solution. The idea is that law and regulation are
not as important or effective at helping people as lawyers and government
planners believe. Coase and others like him wanted a change of approach, to put
the burden of proof for positive effects on a government that was intervening
in the market, by analysing the costs of action. Milton Friedman. Friedman was
also known for his work on the consumption function, the permanent income
hypothesis (1957), which Friedman himself referred to as his best scientific
work. This work contended that rational consumers would spend a proportional
amount of what they perceived to be their permanent income. Windfall gains
would mostly be saved. Tax reductions likewise, as rational consumers would
predict that taxes would have to rise later to balance public finances. Other
important contributions include his critique of the Phillips curve and the
concept of the natural rate of unemployment (1968). This critique associated
his name with the insight that a government that brings about higher inflation
cannot permanently reduce unemployment by doing so. Unemployment may be
temporarily lower, if the inflation is a surprise, but in the long run
unemployment will be determined by the frictions and imperfections in the
labour market. Global times. Amartya Sen. Amartya Sen (born 1933) is a leading
development and welfare economist and has expressed considerable skepticism on
the validity of neo-classical assumptions. He was highly critical of rational
expectations theory, and devoted his work to development and human rights. He
won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1998. Joseph E. Stiglitz. Joseph Stiglitz
(born 1943) Received the Nobel Prize in 2001 for his work in information
economics. He has served as chairman of President Clinton's Council of Economic
Advisors and as chief economist for the World Bank. Stiglitz has taught at many
universities, including Columbia, Stanford, Oxford, Manchester, Yale, and MIT.
In recent years he has become an outspoken critic of global economic
institutions. He is a popular and academic author. In "Making Globalization
Work" (2007), he offers an account of his perspectives on issues of
international economics. Paul Krugman. Paul Krugman (born 1953) is a
contemporary economist. His textbook "International Economics" (2007) appears
on many undergraduate reading lists. Well known as a representative of
progressivism, he writes a biweekly column on economics, American economic
policy, and American politics more generally in the "New York Times". He was
awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2008 for his work on New Trade Theory
and economic geography. Contemporary economic thought. Macroeconomics since the
Bretton Woods era. From the 1970s onwards Friedman's monetarist critique of
Keynesian macroeconomics formed the starting point for a number of trends in
macroeconomic theory opposed to the idea that government intervention can or
should stabilise the economy. Robert Lucas criticized Keynesian thought for its
inconsistency with microeconomic theory. Lucas's critique set the stage for a
neoclassical school of macroeconomics, New Classical economics based on the
foundation of classical economics. Lucas also popularized the idea of rational
expectations, which was used as the basis for several new classical theories
including the Policy Ineffectiveness Proposition. The standard model for new
classical economics is the real business cycle theory, which sought to explain
observed fluctuations in output and employment in terms of real variables such
as changes in technology and tastes. Assuming competitive markets, real
business cycle theory implied that cyclical fluctuations are optimal responses
to variability in technology and tastes, and that macroeconomic stabilisation
policies must reduce welfare. Keynesian economics made a comeback among
mainstream economists with the advent of New Keynesian macroeconomics. The
central theme of new Keynesianism was the provision of a microeconomic
foundation for Keynesian macroeconomics, obtained by identifying minimal
deviations from the standard microeconomic assumptions which yield Keynesian
macroeconomic conclusions, such as the possibility of significant welfare
benefits from macroeconomic stabilization. George Akerlof's 'menu costs'
arguments, showing that, under imperfect competition, small deviations from
rationality generate significant (in welfare terms) price stickiness, are good
example of this kind of work. Economists have combined the methodology of real
business cycle theory with theoretical elements, like sticky prices, from new
Keynesian theory to produce the new neoclassical synthesis. Dynamic stochastic
general equilibrium (DSGE) models, large systems of microeconomic equations
combined into models of the general economy, are central to this new synthesis.
The synthesis dominates present day economics.
