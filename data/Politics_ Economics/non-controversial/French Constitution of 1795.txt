French Constitution of 1795 The Constitution of 22 August 1795 (also known as
the Constitution of the Year III, or the Constitution of 5 Fructidor) was a
national constitution of France ratified by the National Convention on 22
August 1795 (5 Fructidor of the Year III under the French Revolutionary
Calendar) during the French Revolution. It established the Directory, and
remained in effect until the coup of 18 Brumaire (9 November 1799) effectively
ended the Revolution and began the ascendancy of Napoleon Bonaparte. It was
more conservative than the abortive democratic French Constitution of 1793. The
Constitution of 1795 established a liberal republic with a franchise based on
the payment of taxes, similar to that of the French Constitution of 1791; a
bicameral legislature, (Council of Ancients, and a Council of 500) to slow down
the legislative process; and a five-man Directory. The central government
retained great power, including emergency powers to curb freedom of the press
and freedom of association. It was succeeded by the Constitution of the Year
VIII, which established the Consulate.
