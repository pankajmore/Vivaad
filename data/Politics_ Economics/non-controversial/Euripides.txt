Euripides Euripides () (c. 480 – 406 BC) was one of the three great
tragedians of classical Athens, the other two being Aeschylus and Sophocles.
Some ancient scholars attributed ninety-five plays to him but according to the
"Suda" it was ninety-two at most. Of these, eighteen or nineteen have survived
complete (there has been debate about his authorship of "Rhesus", largely on
stylistic grounds) and there are also fragments, some substantial, of most of
the other plays. More of his plays have survived intact than those of Aeschylus
and Sophocles together, partly due to mere chance and partly because his
popularity grew as theirs declinedhe became, in the Hellenistic Age, a
cornerstone of ancient literary education, along with Homer, Demosthenes and
Menander. Euripides is identified with theatrical innovations that have
profoundly influenced drama down to modern times, especially in the
representation of traditional, mythical heroes as ordinary people in
extraordinary circumstances. This new approach led him to pioneer developments
that later writers adapted to comedy, some of which are characteristic of
romance. Yet he also became "the most tragic of poets", focusing on the inner
lives and motives of his characters in a way previously unknown. He was "the
creator of...that cage which is the theatre of Shakespeare's Othello, Racine's
Phèdre, of Ibsen and Strindberg," in which "...imprisoned men and women
destroy each other by the intensity of their loves and hates", and yet he was
also the literary ancestor of comic dramatists as diverse as Menander and
George Bernard Shaw. His contemporaries associated him with Socrates as a
leader of a decadent intellectualism, both of them being frequently lampooned
by comic poets such as Aristophanes. Whereas Socrates was eventually put on
trial and executed as a corrupting influence, Euripides chose a voluntary exile
in old age, dying in Macedonia. Recent scholarship casts doubt on ancient
biographies of Euripides. For example, it is possible that he never visited
Macedonia at all, or, if he did, he might have been drawn there by King
Archelaus with incentives that were also offered to other artists. Life. This
biography is divided into three sections corresponding to the three kinds of
sources. A fabled life. Euripides was the youngest in a set of three great
tragedians who were almost contemporaries: his first play was staged thirteen
years after Sophocles's debut and only three years after Aeschylus's
masterpiece, the "Oresteia". The identity of the threesome is neatly
underscored by a patriotic account of their roles during Greece's great victory
over Persia at the Battle of SalamisAeschylus fought there, Sophocles was just
old enough to celebrate the victory in a boys' chorus and Euripides was born on
the very day of the battle. The apocryphal account that he composed his works
in a cave on Salamis island was a late tradition and it probably symbolizes the
isolation of an intellectual who was rather ahead of his time. Much of his life
and his whole career coincided with the struggle between Athens and Sparta for
hegemony in Greece but he didn't live to see the final defeat of his city. It
is said that he died in Macedonia after being attacked by the Molossian hounds
of King Archelaus and that his cenotaph near Piraeus was struck by
lightningsigns of his unique powers, whether for good or ill (according to one
modern scholar, his death might have been caused instead by the harsh
Macedonian winter). In an account by Plutarch, the catastrophic failure of the
Sicilian expedition led Athenians to trade renditions of Euripides's lyrics to
their enemies in return for food and drink ("Life of Nicias" 29). Plutarch is
the source also for the story that the victorious Spartan generals, having
planned the demolition of Athens and the enslavement of its people, grew
merciful after being entertained at a banquet by lyrics from Euripides's play
"Electra": "they felt that it would be a barbarous act to annihilate a city
which produced such men" ("Life of Lysander") A comic life. In "The Frogs",
composed after Euripides and Aeschylus were both dead, Aristophanes imagines
the god Dionysus venturing down to Hades in search of a good poet to bring back
to Athens. After a debate between the two deceased bards, the god brings
Aeschylus back to life as more useful to Athens on account of his wisdom,
rejecting Euripides as merely clever. Such comic 'evidence' suggests that
Athenians admired Euripides even while they mistrusted his intellectualism, at
least during the long war with Sparta. Aeschylus had written his own epitaph
commemorating his life as a warrior fighting for Athens against Persia, without
any mention of his success as a playwright, and Sophocles was celebrated by his
contemporaries for his social gifts and contributions to public life as a state
official, but there are no records of Euripides's public life except as a
dramatisthe could well have been "a brooding and bookish recluse". He is
presented as such in "The Acharnians", where Aristophanes shows him to be
living morosely in a precarious house, surrounded by the tattered costumes of
his disreputable characters (and yet Agathon, another tragic poet, is
discovered in a later play, Thesmophoriazusae, to be living in circumstances
almost as bizarre). Euripides's mother was a humble vendor of vegetables,
according to the comic tradition, yet his plays indicate that he had a liberal
education and hence a privileged background. A tragedian's life. Euripides
first competed in the City Dionysia, the famous Athenian dramatic festival, in
455 BC, one year after the death of Aeschylus, and it was not until 441 BC that
he won a first prize. His final competition in Athens was in 408 BC. "The
Bacchae" and "Iphigenia in Aulis" were performed after his death in 405 BC and
first prize was awarded posthumously. Altogether his plays won first prize only
five times. His plays and those of Aeschylus and Sophocles indicate a
difference in outlook between the three mena generation gap probably due to the
Sophistical enlightenment in the middle decades of the fifth century: Aeschylus
still looked back to the archaic period, Sophocles was in transition between
periods, and Euripides was fully imbued with the new spirit of the classical
age. When Euripides's plays are sequenced in time, they also reveal that his
outlook might have changed, providing a "spiritual biography" along these
lines: Work. Athenian tragedy in performance during Euripides's lifetime was a
public contest between playwrights. The state funded it and awarded prizes to
the winners. The language was spoken and sung verse, the performance area
included a circular floor or orchestra where the chorus could dance, a space
for actors (three speaking actors in Euripides's time), a backdrop or and some
special effects: an ekkyklema (used to bring the skene's 'indoors' outdoors)
and a mechane (used to lift actors in the air, as in deus ex machina). With the
introduction of the third actor (an innovation attributed to Sophocles), acting
also began to be regarded as a skill to be rewarded with prizes, requiring a
long apprenticeship in the chorus. Euripides and other playwrights accordingly
composed more and more arias for accomplished actors to sing and this tendency
becomes more marked in his later plays: tragedy was a "living and ever-changing
genre" (other changes in his work are touched on in the previous section and in
Chronology; a list of his plays is given in Extant plays below). Euripides's
characters resembled contemporary Athenians rather than heroic figures of myth.
Athenian citizens were familiar with rhetoric in the assembly and law courts,
and some scholars believe that Euripides was more interested in his characters
as speakers with cases to argue than as characters with lifelike personalities.
They are self-conscious about speaking formally and their rhetoric is shown to
be flawed, as if Euripides was exploring the problematical nature of language
and communication: "For speech points in three different directions at once, to
the speaker, to the person addressed, to the features in the world it
describes, and each of these directions can be felt as skewed." Thus in the
example above, Hecuba presents herself as a sophisticated intellectual
describing a rationalized cosmos yet the speech is ill-matched to her audience,
Menelaus (a type of the unsophisticated listener), and soon it is found not to
suit the cosmos either (her infant grandson is brutally murdered by the
victorious Greeks). In "Hippolytus", speeches appear verbose and ungainly as if
to underscore the limitations of language. Like Euripides, both Aeschylus and
Sophocles created comic effects contrasting the heroic with the mundane, but
they employed minor supporting characters for that purpose, whereas the younger
poet was more insistent, using major characters as well. His comic touches can
be thought to intensify the overall tragic effect, and his realism, which often
threatens to make his heroes look ridiculous, marks a world of debased heroism:
"The loss of intellectual and moral substance becomes a central tragic
statement." Psychological reversals are common and sometimes happen so suddenly
that inconsistency in characterization is an issue for many critics, such as
Aristotle, who cited "Iphigenia in Aulis" as an example ("Poetics" 1454a32).
For others, psychological inconsistency is not a stumbling block to good drama:
"Euripides is in pursuit of a larger insight: he aims to set forth the two
modes, emotional and rational, with which human beings confront their own
mortality." Some however consider unpredictable behaviour to be realistic in
tragedy: "everywhere in Euripides a preoccupation with individual psychology
and its irrational aspects is evident...In his hands tragedy for the first time
probed the inner recesses of the human soul and let "passions spin the plot"."
The tension between reason and passion is symbolized by his character's
relationship with the gods, as in Hecuba's prayer, answered not by Zeus, nor by
the Law of Reason, but by brutal Menelaus as if speaking on behalf of the old
gods, and most famously in "Bacchae", where the god Dionysus savages his own
converts. And yet when the gods appear deus ex machina, as they do in eight of
the extant plays, they appear "lifeless and mechanical". Sometimes condemned by
critics as an unimaginative way to end a story, the spectacle of a 'god' making
a judgement or announcement from a theatrical crane might actually have been
intended to provoke scepticism about the religious and heroic dimension of his
plays. Similarly his plays often begin in a banal manner that undermines
theatrical illusion. Unlike Sophocles, who established the setting and
background of his plays in the introductory dialogue, Euripides used a
monologue in which a divinity or human character directly and simply tells the
audience all it needs to know in order to understand the subsequent action.
Aeschylus and Sophocles were innovative, but Euripides had arrived at a
position in the "ever-changing genre" where he could move easily between
tragic, comic, romantic and political effects, a versatility that appears in
individual plays and also over the course of his career. Potential for comedy
lay in his use of 'contemporary' characters, in his sophisticated tone, his
relatively informal Greek (see In Greek below), and in his ingenious use of
plots centred on motifs that later became standard in Menander's New Comedy,
such as the 'recognition scene'. Other tragedians also used recognition scenes
but they were heroic in emphasis, as in Aeschylus's "The Libation Bearers",
which Euripides parodied with his mundane treatment of it in "Electra"
(Euripides was unique among the tragedians in incorporating theatrical
criticism in his plays). Traditional myth, with its exotic settings, heroic
adventures and epic battles, offered potential for romantic melodrama as well
as for political comments on a war theme, so that his plays are an
extraordinary mix of elements. "The Trojan Women" for example is a powerfully
disturbing play on the theme of war's horrors, apparently critical of Athenian
imperialism (it was composed in the aftermath of the Melian massacre and during
the preparations for the Sicilian Expedition) yet it features the comic
exchange between Menelaus and Hecuba quoted above and the chorus considers
Athens, the "blessed land of Theus", to be a desirable refugesuch complexity
and ambiguity are typical both of his 'patriotic' and 'anti-war' plays. Tragic
poets in the fifth century competed against each other at the City Dionysia
with a tetralogy each i.e. three tragedies and a satyr-play. The few extant
fragments of satyr-plays attributed to Aeschylus and Sophocles indicate that
these were a loosely structured, simple and jovial form of entertainment.
However, in "Cyclops" (the only complete satyr-play that survives) Euripides
structured the entertainment more like a tragedy and introduced a note of
critical irony typical of his other work. His genre-bending inventiveness is
shown above all in "Alcestis", a blend of tragic and satyric elements. This
fourth play in his tetralogy for 438 BC (i.e. it occupied the position
conventionally reserved for satyr-plays) is a 'tragedy' that features Heracles
as a satyric hero in conventional satyr-play scenes, involving an arrival, a
banquest, a victory over an ogre (in this case Death), a happy ending, a feast
and a departure to new adventures. Most of the big innovations in tragedy were
made by Aeschylus and Sophocles and yet "Euripides made innovations on a
smaller scale that have impressed some critics as cumulatively leading to a
radical change of direction." In Greek. The spoken language of the plays is not
fundamentally different in style from that of Aeschylus or Sophoclesit employs
poetic meters, a rarified vocabulary, fullness of expression, complex syntax
and ornamental figures, all aimed at representing an elevated style. However,
its rhythms are somewhat freer and more natural than that of his predecessors,
and the vocabulary has been expanded to allow for intellectual and
psychological subtleties. Euripides was also a great lyric poet. In "Medea",
for example, he composed for his city, Athens, "the noblest of her songs of
praise". His lyric skills however are not just confined to individual poems: "A
play of Euripides is a musical whole...one song echoes motifs from the
preceding song, while introducing new ones." For some critics, the lyrics often
seem dislocated from the action but the extent and significance of this is "a
matter of scholarly debate." See Chronology for details about his style in the
original Greek. Reception. Euripides has aroused and continues to arouse
strongly contrasting opinions of his work, for and against: Aeschylus gained
thirteen victories as a dramatist, Sophocles at least twenty, Euripides only
four in his lifetime, and this has often been taken as an indication of the
latter's unpopularity with his contemporaries, and yet a first place might not
have been the main criterion for success in those times (the system of
selecting judges appears to have been flawed) and merely being chosen to
compete was in itself a mark of distinction. Moreover to have been singled out
by Aristophanes for so much comic attention is proof of popular interest in his
work. Sophocles was appreciative enough of the younger poet to be influenced by
him, as is evident in his later plays Philoctetes and Oedipus at Colonus. Less
than a hundred years later, Aristotle developed an almost "biological' theory
of the development of tragedy in Athens: according to this view, the art form
grew under the influence of Aeschylus, matured in the hands of Sophocles then
began its precipitous decline with Euripides. However, "his plays continued to
be applauded even after those of Aeschylus and Sophocles had come to seem
remote and irrelevant", they became school classics in the Hellenistic period
(as mentioned in the introduction) and, due to Seneca's adaptation of his work
for Roman audiences, "it was Euripides, not Aeschylus or Sophocles, whose
tragic muse presided over the rebirth of tragedy in Renaissance Europe." In the
seventeenth century, Racine expressed admiration for Sophocles but was more
influenced by Euripides (e.g. "Iphigenia at Aulis" and "Hippolytus" were the
models for his plays "Iphigénie" and "Phèdre"). Euripides's reputation was to
take a beating early in the nineteenth century when Friedrich Schlegel and his
brother August Wilhelm Schlegel championed Aristotle's 'biological' model of
theatre history, identifying Euripides with the moral, political and artistic
degeneration of Athens. August Wilhelm's Vienna lectures on dramatic art and
literature went through four editions between 1809 and 1846 and, in them, he
opined that Euripides "not only destroyed the external order of tragedy but
missed its entire meaning," a view that came to influence Friedrich Nietzsche,
who however seems not to have known the Euripidean plays at all well. However
literary figures such as the poet Robert Browning and his wife Elizabeth
Barrett Browning could study and admire the Schlegels while still appreciating
Euripides as "our Euripides the human" ("Wine of Cyprus" stanza 12).
Classicists such as Arthur Verrall and Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff
reacted against the views of the Schlegels and Nietzsche, constructing
arguments sympathetic to Euripides, which involved Wilamowitz in this
restatement of Greek tragedy as a genre: "A tragedy does not have to end
'tragically' or be 'tragic'. The only requirement is a serious treatment." In
the English-speaking world, the pacifist Gilbert Murray played an important
role in popularizing Euripides, influenced perhaps by his anti-war plays.
Today, as in the time of Euripides, traditional assumptions are constantly
under challenge and audiences therefore have a natural affinity with the
Euripidean outlook which seems nearer to ours for example than the Elizabethan.
As stated above, however, opinions continue to diverge, so that one recent
critic might dismiss the debates in Euripides's plays as "self-indulgent
digression for the sake of rhetorical display" and another springs to the
poet's defence in terms such as: "His plays are remarkable for their range of
tones and the gleeful inventiveness, which morose critics call cynical
artificiality, of their construction." Texts. Transmission. The textual
transmission of the plays from the fifth century BC, when they were first
written, up until the era of the printing press, was largely a haphazard
process in which much of Euripides's work was lost and corrupted, but it also
included triumphs by scholars and copyists, thanks to whom much was also
recovered and preserved. Summaries of the transmission are often found in
modern editions of the plays, three of which are used as sources for this
summary The plays of Euripides, like those of Aeschylus and Sophocles, were
circulated in written form in the fifth century among literary members of the
audience and performers at minor festivals, as aide-memoirs. However, literary
conventions that we take for granted today had not yet been inventedthere was
no spacing between words, no consistency in punctuation nor in vowel elisions,
no marks for breathings and accent (guides to pronunciation and hence word
recognition), no convention to denote change of speaker and no stage
directions, and verse was written straight across the page like prose. Possibly
those who bought texts supplied their own interpretative markings. Papyri
discoveries have indicated, for example, that a change in speakers was loosely
denoted with a variety of signs, such as the equivalent of the modern dash,
colon and full-stop. The absence of modern literary conventions, which are an
aid to comprehension, was an early and persistent source of errors affecting
transmission of the text. Errors crept in also when Athens replaced its old
Attic alphabet with the Ionian alphabet, a change sanctioned by law in 403-
2 BC, adding a new complication to the task of copying. Many more errors came
from the tendency of actors to interpolate words and sentences, producing so
many corruptions and variations that a law was proposed by Lycurgus of Athens
in 330 BC ""...that the plays of Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides should be
written down and preserved in a public office; and that the town clerk should
read the text over with the actors; and that all performances which did not
comply with this regulation should be illegal."" The law was soon disregarded
and some actors continued to make their own changes up until about 200 BC,
after which the habit dies out. It was about then that Aristophanes of
Byzantium compiled an edition of all the extant plays of Euripides, collated
from pre-Alexandrian texts, furnished with introductions and accompanied by a
commentary that was 'published' separately. This became the 'standard edition'
for the future and it featured some of the literary conventions that modern
readers expectthere was still no spacing between words, little or no
punctuation and no stage directions, but abbreviated names now denoted changes
of speaker, lyrics are broken into 'cola' and 'strophai' or lines and stanzas,
and a system of accentuation was introduced. [[File:Medea-fragment-4th-5th-
CE.gif|thumb|right|Fragment of a vellum codex from the 4th-5th centuries AD,
showing choral anapaests from Medea, lines 1087-91. Tiny though it is, the
fragment influences modern editions of the play.]] After this creation of a
standard edition, the text was fairly safe from errors, apart from the slight
and gradual corruption produced by the tedium of frequent copying. Many of
these trivial errors occurred in the Byzantine period, following a change in
script from uncial to minuscule, and many were 'homophonic' errors, when
scribes accidentally substituted homophones for words in the textequivalent in
English to substituting 'right' for 'write', except that there were more
opportunities for Byzantine scribes to make these errors because the Greek
letters η, ι, οι and ει were pronounced similarly in the Byzantine
period. Around 200 AD, ten of the plays of Euripides began to be circulated in
a select edition, possibly for use in schools, with some commentaries or
scholia recorded in the margins. Similar editions had appeared for Aeschylus
and Sophoclesthe only plays of theirs that survive today: ""The rise of Goths
and Tartars throughout the Roman world from the gutter to the throne, the
destruction of libraries by choleric and fanatical popes and emperors, were
unfavourable to the progress but not entirely fatal to the preservation of
literary studies."" Euripides however was more fortunate than the other
tragedians in the survival of a second edition of his work, compiled in
alphabetical order as if from a set of his collect works, but without scholia
attached. This 'Alphabetical' edition was combined with the 'Select' edition by
some unknown Byzantine scholar, bringing together all the nineteen plays that
survive today. The 'Select' plays are found in many medieval manuscripts but
only two manuscripts preserve the 'Alphabetical' playsoften denoted L and P,
after the Laurentian Library at Florence, and the Bibliotheca Palatina in the
Vatican, where they are stored. It is believed that P derived its Alphabet
plays and some Select plays from copies of an ancestor of L, but the remainder
is derived from elsewhere. P contains all the extant plays of Euripides, L is
missing "The Trojan Women" and latter part of "The Bacchae". In addition to L,
P and many other medieval manuscripts, there are also fragments of plays
recorded on papyrus. The papyrus fragments are often recovered only through
modern technology. In June 2005, for example, classicists at Oxford University
worked on a joint project with Brigham Young University, using multi-spectral
imaging technology to retrieve previously illegible writing (see References).
Some of this work employed infrared technology—previously used for satellite
imaging—to detect previously unknown material by Euripides in fragments of
the Oxyrhynchus papyri, a collection of ancient manuscripts held by the
university. It is from such materials that modern scholars try to piece
together copies of the original plays. Sometimes the picture is almost lost.
Thus for example two extant plays, "The Phoenicean Women" and "Iphigenia at
Aulis", are significantly corrupted by interpolations (the latter possibly
being completed post mortem by the poet's son) and the very authorship of
"Rhesus" is a matter of dispute. In fact, the very existence of the Alphabet
plays, or rather the absence of an equivalent edition for Sophocles and
Aeschylus, could distort our notions of distinctive Euripidean qualitiesmost of
his least 'tragic' plays are in the Alphabet edition and possibly the other two
tragedians would appear just as genre-bending as this "restless experimenter"
if we possessed more than their 'select' editions. "See Extant plays below for
listing of 'Select' and 'Alphabetical' plays." Chronology. The original
production dates of some of Euripides's plays are known from ancient records,
such as lists of prize-winners at the Dionysia, and approximations are obtained
for the remainder by various means. Both the playwright and his work were
travestied by comic poets such as Aristophanes, the known dates of whose own
plays thus serve as a terminus ad quem for those of Euripides, though sometimes
the gap can be considerable (e.g. twenty-seven years separate "Telephus", known
to have been produced in 438 BC, from its parody in Thesmophoriazusae in 411
BC!) References in Euripides's plays to contemporary events provide a terminus
a quo, though sometimes the references might even precede a datable event (e.g.
lines 1074-89 in Ion describe a procession to Eleusis, which was probably
written before the Spartans occupied it during the Peloponnesian War). Other
indications of dating are obtained by stylometry and this section therefore is
an appropriate place to consider some aspects of his style as a Greek poet.
Greek tragedy comprised lyric and dialogue, the latter mostly in iambic
trimeter (three pairs of iambic feet per line). Euripides sometimes 'resolved'
the two syllables of the iamb (˘¯) into three syllables (˘˘˘) and this
tendency increased so steadily over time that the number of resolved feet in a
play can be understood to indicate the approximate date of composition (see
Extant plays below for one scholar's list of resolutions per hundred
trimeters). Associated with this increase in resolutions was an increasing
vocabulary for tragic dialogue, often involving prefixes to refine meanings,
allowing the language to assume a more natural rhythm while also becoming ever
more capable of psychological and philosophical subtlety. The trochaic
tetrameter catalecticfour pairs of trochees per line, with the final syllable
omittedwas identified by Aristotle as the original meter of tragic dialogue
("Poetics" 1449a21). Euripides however employs it here and there in his later
plays. He seems not to have used it in his early plays at all, "The Trojan
Women" being the earliest appearance of it in an extant play - it's symptomatic
of a curious archaizing tendency evident in his later works. The later plays
also feature extensive use of stichomythia (i.e. a series of one-liners). The
longest such scene comprises one hundred and five lines in "Ion" (lines 264-
369). In contrast, Aeschylus never exceeded twenty lines of stichomythia;
Sophocles's longest such scene was fifty lines and it is interrupted several
times by αντιλαβή (Electra, lines 1176-1226). Euripides's use of lyrics
in the sung portion of his work shows the influence of Timotheus of Miletus in
the later plays the individual singer gained prominence and was given
additional scope to demonstrate his virtuosity in lyrical duets between actors,
as well as replacing some of the chorus's functions with monodies. At the same
time, choral odes begin to take on something of the form of dithyrambs
reminiscent of the poetry of Bacchylides, featuring elaborate treatment of
myths. Sometimes these later choral odes seem to have only a tenuous connection
with the plot, linked to the action only in their mood. The "Bacchae" however
shows a reversion to old forms, possibly as a deliberate archaic effect or
maybe because there were no virtuoso choristers in Macedonia, where it is said
to have been written. Extant plays. Key: Lost and fragmentary plays. The
following plays have come down to us today only in fragmentary form, if at all.
They are known through quotations in other works, sometimes as little as a
single line, or through pieces of papyrus or partial copies in manuscript form;
some are known thanks to the survival of part of a collection of hypotheses (or
summaries) in papyrus, and others through being parodied in the works of
Aristophanes. Some the fragments are extensive enough to allow tentative
reconstructions to be proposed. A two-volume selection from the fragments, with
facing-page translation, introductions, and notes, was published by Collard,
Cropp, Lee, and Gibert , as were two Loeb Classical Library volumes derived
from them, and there are critical studies in T. B. L. Webster's older "The
Tragedies of Euripides" based upon what were then believed to be the most
likely reconstructions of the plays. The following lost and fragmentary plays
are of uncertain date, and are arranged in English alphabetical order.
