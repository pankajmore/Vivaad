Network effect In economics and business, a network effect (also called network
externality or demand-side economies of scale) is the effect that one user of a
good or service has on the value of that product to other people. When network
effect is present, the value of a product or service is dependent on the number
of others using it. The classic example is the telephone. The more people own
telephones, the more valuable the telephone is to each owner. This creates a
positive externality because a user may purchase a telephone without intending
to create value for other users, but does so in any case. Online social
networks work in the same way, with sites like Twitter, Facebook, and Google+
being more useful the more users join. The expression "network effect" is
applied most commonly to positive network externalities as in the case of the
telephone. Negative network externalities can also occur, where more users make
a product less valuable, but are more commonly referred to as "congestion" (as
in traffic congestion or network congestion). Over time, positive network
effects can create a bandwagon effect as the network becomes more valuable and
more people join, in a positive feedback loop. Origins. Network effects were a
central theme in the arguments of Theodore Vail, the first post patent
president of Bell Telephone, in gaining a monopoly on US telephone services. In
1908, when he presented the concept in Bell's annual report, there were over
4000 local and regional telephone exchanges, most of which were eventually
merged into the Bell System. The economics of network effects were presented in
a paper by Bell employee N. Lytkins in 1917. The economic theory of the network
effect was advanced significantly between 1985 and 1995 by researchers Michael
L. Katz, Carl Shapiro, Joseph Farrell and Garth Saloner. Network effects were
popularized by Robert Metcalfe, stated as Metcalfe's law. Metcalfe was one of
the co-inventors of Ethernet and a co-founder of the company 3Com. In selling
the product, Metcalfe argued that customers needed Ethernet cards to grow above
a certain critical mass if they were to reap the benefits of their network.
According to Metcalfe, the rationale behind the sale of networking cards was
that (1) the cost of the network was directly proportional to the number of
cards installed, but (2) the value of the network was proportional to the
square of the number of users. This was expressed algebraically as having a
cost of N, and a value of NÂ². While the actual numbers behind this definition
were never firm, the concept allowed customers to share access to expensive
resources like disk drives and printers, send e-mail, and access the Internet.
Rod Beckstrom presented a mathematical model for describing networks that are
in a state of positive network effect at BlackHat and Defcon in 2009 and also
presented the "inverse network effect" with an economic model for defining it
as well. Benefits. Network effects become significant after a certain
subscription percentage has been achieved, called critical mass. At the
critical mass point, the value obtained from the good or service is greater
than or equal to the price paid for the good or service. As the value of the
good is determined by the user base, this implies that after a certain number
of people have subscribed to the service or purchased the good, additional
people will subscribe to the service or purchase the good due to the value
exceeding the price. A key business concern must then be how to attract users
prior to reaching critical mass. One way is to rely on extrinsic motivation,
such as a payment, a fee waiver, or a request for friends to sign up. A more
natural strategy is to build a system that has enough value "without" network
effects, at least to early adopters. Then, as the number of users increases,
the system becomes even more valuable and is able to attract a wider user base.
Beyond critical mass, the increasing number of subscribers generally cannot
continue indefinitely. After a certain point, most networks become either
congested or saturated, stopping future uptake. Congestion occurs due to
overuse. The applicable analogy is that of a telephone network. While the
number of users is below the congestion point, each additional user adds
additional value to every other customer. However, at some point the addition
of an extra user exceeds the capacity of the existing system. After this point,
each additional user decreases the value obtained by every other user. In
practical terms, each additional user increases the total system load, leading
to busy signals, the inability to get a dial tone, and poor customer support.
The next critical point is where the value obtained again equals the price
paid. The network will cease to grow at this point, and the system must be
enlarged. The congestion point may be larger than the market size. New Peer-to-
peer technological models may always defy congestion. Peer-to-peer systems, or
"P2P," are networks designed to distribute load among their user pool. This
theoretically allows true P2P networks to scale indefinitely. The P2P based
telephony service Skype benefits greatly from this effect (though market
saturation will still occur). Network effects are commonly mistaken for
economies of scale, which result from business size rather than
interoperability. To help clarify the distinction, people speak of demand side
vs. supply side economies of scale. Classical economies of scale are on the
production side, while network effects arise on the demand side. Network
effects are also mistaken for economies of scope. The network effect has a lot
of similarities with the description of phenomenon in reinforcing positive
feedback loops described in system dynamics. System dynamics could be used as a
modelling method to describe phenomena such as word of mouth and Bass model of
marketing. Technology lifecycle. If some existing technology or company whose
benefits are largely based on network effects starts to lose market share
against a challenger such as a disruptive technology or open standards based
competition, the benefits of network effects will reduce for the incumbent, and
increase for the challenger. In this model, a tipping point is eventually
reached at which the network effects of the challenger dominate those of the
former incumbent, and the incumbent is forced into an accelerating decline,
whilst the challenger takes over the incumbent's former position. Lock-in. Not
surprisingly network economics became a hot topic after the diffusion of the
Internet across academia. Most people know only of Metcalfe's law as part of
network effects. Network effects are notorious for causing lock-in with the
most-cited examples being Microsoft products and the QWERTY keyboard. Vendor
lock-in can be mitigated by opening the standards upon which users depend,
allowing competition between implementations. This does not, however, mitigate
industry-wide lock-in to the standard itself. Indeed, as there are now multiple
vendors driving down the price and increasing the quality, more users are
likely to adopt the standard thereby creating greater industry-wide lock-in to
the standard. Negative network effects. There are negative network effects
beyond lock-in. Open versus closed standards. In communication and information
technologies, open standards and interfaces are often developed through the
participation of multiple companies and are usually perceived to provide mutual
benefit. But, in cases in which the relevant communication protocols or
interfaces are closed standards the network effect can give the company
controlling those standards monopoly power. The Microsoft corporation is widely
seen by computer professionals as maintaining its monopoly through these means.
One observed method Microsoft uses to put the network effect to its advantage
is called Embrace, extend and extinguish. Mirabilis is an Israeli start-up
which pioneered instant messaging (IM) and was bought by America Online. By
giving away their ICQ product for free and preventing interoperability between
their client software and other products, they were able to temporarily
dominate the market for instant messaging. Because of the network effect, new
IM users gained much more value by choosing to use the Mirabilis system (and
join its large network of users) than they would using a competing system. As
was typical for that era, the company never made any attempt to generate
profits from their dominant position before selling the company. Examples.
Financial exchanges. Stock exchanges and derivatives exchanges feature a
network effect. Market liquidity is a major determinant of transaction cost in
the sale or purchase of a security, as a bid-ask spread exists between the
price at which a purchase can be done versus the price at which the sale of the
same security can be done. As the number of buyers and sellers on an exchange
increases, liquidity increases, and transaction costs decrease. This then
attracts a larger number of buyers and sellers to the exchange. See, for
example, the work of Steve Wunsch (1999). The network advantage of financial
exchanges is apparent in the difficulty that startup exchanges have in
dislodging a dominant exchange. For example, the Chicago Board of Trade has
retained overwhelming dominance of trading in US Treasury bond futures despite
the startup of Eurex US trading of identical futures contracts. Similarly, the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange has maintained a dominance in trading of Eurobond
interest rate futures despite a challenge from Euronext.Liffe. Software. There
are very strong network effects operating in the market for widely used
computer software. Take, for example, Microsoft Office. For many people
choosing an office suite, prime considerations include how valuable having
learned that office suite will prove to potential employers, and how well the
software interoperates with other users. That is, since learning to use an
office suite takes many hours, they want to invest that time learning the
office suite that will make them most attractive to potential employers (or
consulting clients, etc.), and they also want to be able to share documents.
(Additionally, an example of an indirect network effect in this case is the
notable similarity in user-interfaces and operability menus of most new
softwareÂ â€“ since that similarity directly translates into less time spent
learning new environments, therefore potentially greater acceptance and
adoption of those products.) Similarly, finding already-trained employees is a
big concern for employers when deciding which office suite to purchase or
standardize on. The lack of cross-platform user-interface standards results in
a situation in which one firm is in control of almost 100% of the market.
Microsoft Windows is a further example of network effect. The most-vaunted
advantage of Windows, and that most publicised by Microsoft, is that Windows is
compatible with the widest range of computer hardware and software. Although
this claim is justified, it is in reality the result of network effect:
hardware and software manufacturers ensure that their products are compatible
with Windows in order to have access to the large market of Windows users.
Thus, Windows is popular because it is well supported, but is well supported
because it is popular. However, network effects need not lead to market
dominance by one firm, when there are standards which allow multiple firms to
interoperate, thus allowing the network externalities to benefit the entire
market. This is true for the case of x86-based personal computer hardware, in
which there are extremely strong market pressures to interoperate with pre-
existing standards, but in which no one firm dominates in the market. Also, it
is true for the development of enterprise software applications where the
Internet (HTTP), databases (SQL), and to a moderate degree, service-oriented
message buses (SOA) have become common interfaces. Further up the development
chain there are network effects as well in language back-end base platforms
(JVM, CLR, LLVM), programming models (FP, OOP) and languages themselves.
Telecommunications. The same holds true for the market for long-distance
telephone service within the United States. In fact, the existence of these
types of networks discourages dominance of the market by one company, as it
creates pressures which work against one company attempting to establish a
proprietary protocol or to even distinguish itself by means of product
differentiation. Web sites. Many web sites also feature a network effect. One
example is web marketplaces and exchanges, in that the value of the marketplace
to a new user is proportional to the number of other users in the market. For
example, eBay would not be a particularly useful site if auctions were not
competitive. However, as the number of users grows on eBay, auctions grow more
competitive, pushing up the prices of bids on items. This makes it more
worthwhile to sell on eBay and brings more sellers onto eBay, which drives
prices down again as this increases supply, while bringing more people onto
eBay because there are more things being sold that people want. Essentially, as
the number of users of eBay grows, prices fall and supply increases, and more
and more people find the site to be useful. The collaborative encyclopedia
Wikipedia also benefits from a network effect. The theory goes that as the
number of editors grows, the quality of information on the website improves,
encouraging more users to turn to it as a source of information; some of the
new users in turn become editors, continuing the process. Social networking
websites are also good examples. The more people register onto a social
networking website, the more useful the website is to its registrants. By
contrast, the value of a news site is primarily proportional to the quality of
the articles, not to the number of other people using the site. Similarly, the
first generation of search sites experienced little network effect, as the
value of the site was based on the value of the search results. This allowed
Google to win users away from Yahoo! without much trouble, once users believed
that Google's search results were superior. Some commentators mistook the value
of the Yahoo! brand (which does increase as more people know of it) for a
network effect protecting its advertising business. Alexa Internet uses a
technology that tracks users' surfing patterns; thus Alexa's Related Sites
results improve as more users use the technology. Alexa's network relies
heavily on a small number of browser software relationships, which makes the
network more vulnerable to competition. Google has also attempted to create a
network effect in its advertising business with its Google AdSense service.
Google AdSense places ads on many small sites, such as blogs, using Google
technology to determine which ads are relevant to which blogs. Thus, the
service appears to aim to serve as an exchange (or ad network) for matching
many advertisers with many small sites (such as blogs). In general, the more
blogs Google AdSense can reach, the more advertisers it will attract, making it
the most attractive option for more blogs, and so on, making the network more
valuable for all participants. Network effects were used as justification for
some of the dot-com business models in the late 1990s. These firms operated
under the belief that when a new market comes into being which contains strong
network effects, firms should care more about growing their market share than
about becoming profitable. This was believed because market share will
determine which firm can set technical and marketing standards and thus
determine the basis of future competition. Rail gauge. There are strong network
effects in the initial choice of rail gauge, and in gauge conversion decisions.
Even when placing isolated rails not connected to any other lines, track layers
usually choose a standard rail gauge so they can use off-the-shelf rolling
stock. Although a few manufacturers make rolling stock that can adjust to
different rail gauges, most manufacturers make rolling stock that only works
with one of the standard rail gauges.
