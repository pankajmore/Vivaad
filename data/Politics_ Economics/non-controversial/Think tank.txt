Think tank A think tank (or policy institute) is an organization that conducts
research and engages in advocacy in areas such as social policy, political
strategy, economics, military, technology issues, and in the creative and
cultural field. Most think tanks are non-profit organizations, which some
countries such as the United States and Canada provide with tax exempt status.
Other think tanks are funded by governments, advocacy groups, or businesses, or
derive revenue from consulting or research work related to their projects. The
following article lists global think tanks according to continental categories,
and then sub-categories by country within those areas. These listings are not
comprehensive, given that more than 4,500 think tanks exist world wide. In
general, this article is an introduction to the think tank landscape, and
provides a way to quickly navigate to those of interest. History. While the
term "think tank" originated in the 1950s, such organizations date to the 19th
century. The Institute for Defence and Security Studies (RUSI) was founded in
1831 in London. The Fabian Society in Britain dates from 1884. The Brookings
Institution began in Washington in 1916. After 1945, the number of think tanks
grew, as many smaller new think tanks were formed to express various issue and
policy agendas. Until the 1940s, most think tanks were known only by the name
of the institution. During the Second World War, think tanks were referred to
as "brain boxes" after the slang term for the skull. The phrase "think tank" in
wartime American slang referred to rooms where strategists discussed war
planning. The term think tank itself, however, originally referred to
organizations that offered military advice‚Äîmost notably the RAND Corporation,
founded originally in 1946 as an offshoot of Douglas Aircraft, and which became
an independent corporation in 1948. For most of the 20th century, independent
public policy think tanks that performed research and provided advice on public
policy were an organizational phenomenon found primarily in the United States,
with a much smaller number in Canada and Western Europe. Although think tanks
existed in Japan for some time, they generally lacked independence, having
close ties to government ministries or corporations. There has been a veritable
proliferation of "think tanks" around the world that began in the 1980s as a
result of the forces of globalization, the end of the Cold War, and the
emergence of transnational problems. Two-thirds of all the think tanks that
exist today were established after 1970 and over half were established since
1980. The impact of globalization on the think tank movement is most evident in
regions such as Africa, Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and parts of Southeast
Asia, where there was a concerted effort by the international community to
support the creation of independent public policy research organizations. A
recent survey conducted by the Foreign Policy Research Institute‚Äôs Think
Tanks and Civil Societies Program underscores the significance of this effort
and documents the fact that most of the think tanks in these regions have been
established in the last 10 years. Today there are over 4,500 of these
institutions around the world. Many of the more established think tanks, having
been created during the Cold War, are focused on international affairs,
security studies, and foreign policy. Also see the United Nations Development
Programme definition. Types. Think tanks vary by ideological perspectives,
sources of funding, issue focus and prospective audience. Some think tanks,
such as the Heritage Foundation, which promotes conservative principles, and
the Center for American Progress on the progressive front, are more partisan in
purpose. Others, including the Tellus Institute, which focuses on social and
environmental topics, are more issue-oriented groups. Still others, such as the
Cato Institute, promote libertarian social and economic theories based on
Friedrich von Hayek's idea of free markets and individual liberty. Funding
sources and the targeted audiences also define the workings of think tanks.
Some receive direct government support, while others rely on private individual
or corporate donors. This will invariably affect the levels of academic freedom
within each think tank and to whom or what the institution feels beholden.
Funding may also reflect who or what the institution wants to influence; in the
United States, for example, "Some donors want to influence votes in Congress or
shape public opinion, others want to position themselves or the experts they
fund for future government jobs, while others want to push specific areas of
research or education." A new trend, resulting from globalization, is
collaboration between think tanks across continents. For instance, the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace operates offices in Washington, D.C.,
Beijing, Beirut, Brussels and Moscow. The Think Tanks and Civil Societies
Program (TTCSP) at the University of Pennsylvania annually rates think tanks
worldwide in a number of categories and presents its findings in the "Global
Go-To Think Tanks" rating index. However, this approach to the study and
assessment of think tanks has been criticised by think tank researchers such as
Enrique Mendizabal and Goran Buldioski, Director of the Think Tank Fund,
supported by the Open Society Institute. Functional approach in Latin America.
How a think tank addresses these largely depends on how they work, their
ideology vs. evidence credentials, and the context they operate in (including
funding opportunities, the degree and type of competition they face, their
staff, etc.). According to the National Institute for Research Advancement, a
Japanese think tank, think tanks are "one of the main policy actors in
democratic societies ..., assuring a pluralistic, open and accountable process
of policy analysis, research, decision-making and evaluation". A study in early
2009 found a total of 5,465 think tanks worldwide. Of that number, 1,777 were
based in the United States and approximately 350 in Washington DC alone.
Criticism. In some cases, corporate interests have found it useful to create
"think tanks." For example, The Advancement of Sound Science Coalition was
formed in the mid 1990s to dispute research finding a link between second-hand
smoke and cancer. According to an internal memo from Philip Morris referring to
the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), "the credibility of
the EPA is defeatable, but not on the basis of ETS (environmental tobacco
smoke) alone. It must be part of a larger mosaic that concentrates all the
EPA's enemies against it at one time." According to the left-wing non-
government organization Fair.org, right-wing think tanks are often quoted and
rarely labeled. The result is that sometimes think tank "experts" are depicted
as neutral sources without any ideological predispositions when, in fact, they
represent a particular perspective. In the field of education, think tank
publications are subjected to expert review by the National Education Policy
Center's "Think Twice" think tank review project. A think tank is often a
"tank", in the intellectual sense: discussion only in a closed circle protected
from outside influence isolates the participants, subjects them to several
cognitive biases (groupthink, confirmation bias) and fosters members' existing
beliefs. This leads to surprisingly radical and even unfeasible ideas being
published. Many think tanks, however, purposefully attempt to alleviate this
problem by selecting members from diverse backgrounds. Asian think tanks.
Bangladesh. In the People's Republic of Bangladesh a number of think tanks are
working on foreign policy and security issues. Most of these are based in
Dhaka. Among the think tanks set up by the government, Bangladesh Institute of
International and Strategic Studies (BIISS) stands as one of the prime
organizations that works to undertake and promote research and deliberation on
international affairs, security and developmental issues of the country. In
1984, the government of Bangladesh issued an ordinance to define organogram and
objectives of the think tank. China. In the People's Republic of China a number
of think tanks are sponsored by governmental agencies, like Development
Research Center of the State Council, but still retain sufficient non-official
status to be able to propose and debate ideas more freely. Most of the actual
diplomacy between China and the United States has taken the form of academic
exchanges between members of think tanks. In January 2012, the first non-
official think-tank in China, South Non-Governmental Think-Tank, was
established in Guang-Dong province. Hong Kong. In Hong Kong, those early think
tanks established in the late 1980s and early 1990s focused on the political
development including first direct Legislative Council members election in 1991
and the political framework of "One Country, Two Systems" manifested in the
Sino-British Joint Declaration. After the transfer of sovereignty to China in
1997, more and more think tanks were established by various groups of
intellectuals and professionals. They have various missions and objectives
including promoting civic education; undertaking research on economic social
and political policies; promoting "public understanding of and participation in
the political, economic, and social development of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region". India. India has the third largest number of think
tanks in the world. Many are based in New Delhi, and a few are government
sponsored. A number of these work on foreign policy and security issues. There
are few think tanks like Centre for Civil Society who promote liberal social
and economic ideas and others like the Rakshak Foundation, who encourage
students to do empirical research and gain first hand experience in public
policy issues. Vivekananda International Foundation another example. Gateway
House: Indian Council on Global Relations, a think tank based in Mumbai looks
at the intersection of foreign policy and business - and how India's businesses
are shaping India's interactions with the world. Islamic Republic of Iran.
Several organizations established in Iran since the late 1990s offer a unique
blend of interdisciplinary research. Their focuses have been to provide social
managers and policies. Andishkadeh Yaghin (CBSDA), Atinegaar Think Tank, Nano
Health Think Tank, ASEF Think tank, Seywan Institute, and Sharif Think tank &
Polytechnic Think Tank are some famous Think tanks in this region. Think tank
is called "Andishkadeh" in the Persian language. Japan. Japan has over 100
think tanks, most of which cover not only policy research but also economy,
technology and so on. Some are government related, but most of the think tanks
are sponsored by the private sector. Republic of Korea (South Korea). In Korea,
the National Research Council for Economics, Humanities and Social Sciences
(NRCS) is a public institution that supported 23 related research institutes in
their quest to achieve the effective management and improvement of their
research environment under the Prime Minister. It was established with the
objective of supporting and fostering research institutes in the area of
economics and social science and systematically supervising them in their
contributions to the production of high-quality national policy research and
the development of a concrete knowledge industry. The NRCS was reorganized in
2005 through the merger of the Korea Council of Economic and Social Research
Institutes and the Korea Research Council for Humanities and Social Sciences
established separately in 1999. The Center for Free Enterprise (Korea) is a
free market think tank located in Seoul, South Korea, with pages in English and
Korean. Malaysia. Most Malaysia think tanks are government or political party
related. They focus on defence, politicsm and policies. Notable ones include
the Institute of Strategic and International Studies (ISIS), Malaysian
Strategic Research Centre (MSRC), International Institute of Advanced Islamic
Studies (IAIS) Malaysia, Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs (IDEAS),
Maritime Institute of Malaysia (MIMA) and Penang Institute (formerly Socio-
economic and Environmental Research Institute (SERI)). IDEAS is Malaysia's
first policy oriented classical liberal think tank. Pakistan. Pakistan's think
tanks mainly revolve around internal politics, foreign security issues, and
regional geo-politics. Most of these are centered around the capital,
Islamabad, and have been founded by former military and intelligence personnel.
Most recently, institutes such as the National University of Sciences and
Technology have embarked on creating industrial linkages to create think tanks
focusing on industrial and economic growth issues. Other think tanks concern
religion and how its influence could grow in an already religious country.
These are centred throughout the country and work under the umbrella of the
mammoth Jamaat-e-Islami with headquarters in Lahore and has immense global
influence, reach and regard among more traditional Muslims. However the Jamat
is a political party, and affiliations with reputable think tanks in Pakistan
are not clear. There are several other think tanks as well, such as those
concerning the state of education in the country, which hold many former or
present educators. There are also think tanks concerning human rights, women
rights, labour rights, justice, city development, heritage protection, and
environmental protection, all headed by the country's urban dwelling, educated
elite living, most of whom have studied or worked abroad. There remains a
vacuum for former high ranking Government officials and party members to
contribute to the think tank and policy advocacy process in these areas. Some
notable Pakistani think tanks are the Institute of Policy Studies, the Pakistan
Institute of International Affairs,the Corporate Advisory Council (NUST)and
Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI). Most are known to the general
public through seminars and newspaper articles, or conducting workshops and
lectures at colleges and universities. Republic of the Philippines. The
Institute for Strategic and Development Studies (ISDS Philippines) is an
independent non-profit, policy research and advocacy institution that is also
involved in training activities in cooperation with other training institutions
at home and abroad. It was founded by a group of academics from the University
of the Philippines Diliman in April 1991. It was established in response to the
need for an ongoing evaluation and interpretation of the changes in national
and international affairs by serious international, regional, and national
analysts. It was also aimed at responding to the need to provide academics a
venue for research to enrich teaching and to provide inputs to policy-making.
The PIPVTR is an independent, non-stock, non-profit, non-governmental research
organization officially registered at the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) on 29 November 2007 as Philippine Institute for Political Violence and
Terrorism Research. It was first conceptualized in September 2005 by a group of
experts, academics and practitioners who see the need to establish a center in
the Philippines dedicated to the study of political violence and terrorism and
their implications for peace and security. Think tanks in the Philippines could
be generally categorized in terms of their linkages with the national
government. Several were set up by the Philippine government for the specific
purpose of providing research input into the policy-making process. Sri Lanka.
Sri Lanka has a number of think tanks that are in the form governmental, non-
governmental and corporate organizations. Recently, the Ministry of External
Affairs of Sri Lanka (formerly known as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs)
established a "Foreign Policy Think Tank" to facilitate the professional
advancement of the country's foreign policy and the conduct of its external
affairs. The structure of government Think Tanks in Sri Lanka are structured
with the help of many academics and intellectuals affiliated with the
government. The Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute of International Relations and
Strategic Studies is a regionally acclaimed policy-studies institute that is
often referred to as a think tank. The Institute of Policy Studies in Colombo
is another policy planning related think tank. The International Center for
Ethnic Studies (located both in Colombo and Kandy) is another research-related
think tank. There are several other focus-research institutes throughout the
country that may be referred to as Think Tanks, such as the Marga Institute of
Sri Lanka. Other think tanks in Sri Lanka include the Islamic Think Tank and
the Sri Lanka Think Tank ‚Äì UK. Many private and government universities in
Sri Lanka have research-related think tanks. European think tanks. Belgium.
Brussels hosts most of the European Institutions, hence a large number of
international think tanks are based there. Among them there is the Centre for
European Policy Studies (CEPS), Bruegel, the Global Governance Institute (GGI),
the European Policy Centre (EPC), ThinkYoung, the Friends of Europe, the Lisbon
Council, the European Centre of International Political Economy (ECIPE), and
the Centre for the New Europe (CNE). Although headquartered in the Netherlands
the European Centre for Development Policy Management (ECDPM) also maintains an
office in Brussels. The Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR), though
based in London, is a network of researchers based throughout Europe that
contributes actively to European policy debates. Croatia. In Croatia,
Innovation Institute is a NGO with a mission to develop innovative potential by
promoting creativity, innovativeness, unorthodox thinking and questioning
existing dogmas. It aims at changing the culture from being focused on
redistribution of value to being focused on value creation. The key target
segments include: managers, entrepreneurs, policy makers, academics and
students. Czech Republic. The Association for International Affairs is the
foremost Czech think-tank specializing in the field of international politics
and diplomacy. It focuses on three areas: education (with the largest
educational project in Central Europe, the Prague Student Summit), research (at
its Research Center) and international outreach (currently in Belarus and other
countries). Finland. Finland has several small think tanks that provide
expertise in very specific fields. Vasemmistofoorumi researches the future of
leftism, OK Do is a socially-minded design thinking organization, Demos
Helsinki is a think tank that researches future society and Culture Crisis
Management is political artists' think tank. In addition to specific
independent think tanks, the largest political parties have their own think
tank organizations. This is mainly due to support granted by state for such
activity. The corporate world has focused their efforts to central
representative organization Confederation of Finnish Industries, which acts as
think tank in addition to negotiating salaries with workers unions.
Furthermore, there is the Finnish Business and Policy Forum ("Elinkeinoel√§m√§n
valtuuskunta", EVA). Agricultural and regional interests, associated with The
Central Union of Agricultural Producers and Forest Owners ("Maa- ja
mets√§taloustuottajain Keskusliitto", MTK) and the Centre Party, are researched
by Pellervo Economic Research ("Pellervon taloustutkimus", PTT). The Central
Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions ("Suomen Ammattiliittojen
Keskusj√§rjest√∂", SAK) and the Social Democratic Party are associated with the
Labour Institute for Economic Research ("Palkansaajien tutkimuslaitos", PT).
Each of these organizations often release forecasts concerning the national
economy. France. The French Institute of International Relations (IFRI) was
founded in 1979 and is the third oldest think tank of western Europe, after the
Chatam House (UK, 1920) and the Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute (Sweden, 1960). The primary goals of IFRI are to develop applied
research in the field of public policy related to international issues, and
foster interactive and constructive dialogue between researchers,
professionals, and opinion leaders. France also hosts the European Union
Institute for Security Studies (EUISS), a Paris-based agency of the European
Union and think tank researching security issues of relevance for the EU. There
are also a number of pro-business think tanks, notably the Paris-based
Fondation Concorde. The foundation focuses on increasing the competitiveness of
French SME's and aims to revive entrepreneurship in France. Germany. In Germany
all of the major parties are loosely associated with research foundations that
play some role in shaping policy, but generally from the more disinterested
role of providing research to support policymakers than explicitly proposing
policy. These include the Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung (Social Democratic Party-
aligned), the Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung (Christian Democratic Union-aligned),
the Hanns-Seidel-Stiftung (Christian Social Union-aligned), the Heinrich-B√∂ll-
Stiftung (aligned with the Greens), Friedrich Naumann Foundation (Free
Democratic Party-aligned) and the Rosa Luxemburg Foundation (aligned with Die
Linke). The German Institute for International and Security Affairs is a
prominent example of a German foreign policy think tank. Atlantic Community
think tank is an example of independent, non-partisan and non-profit
organization set up as a joint project of Atlantische Initiative e.V. and
Atlantic Initiative U.S. The Institute for Media and Communication Policy is
the leading think tank in the realm of media. Greece. In Greece there are many
think tanks, also called research organisations or institutes. Netherlands. All
major political parties in the Netherlands have state-sponsored research
foundations that play a role in shaping policy. The Dutch government also has
its own think tank: the Scientific Council for Government Policy. One of the
oldest think tanks in the Netherlands is the Transnational Institute in
Amsterdam (1974). Maastricht in the Netherlands is also the headquarters of the
European Centre for Development Policy Management (ECDPM) a "think and do tank"
with a Europe and Africa focus. Poland. There is a large pool of think-tanks in
Poland; none of them stands out however. The oldest state-sponsored think tank
is The Western Institute in Pozna≈Ñ (Polish: Instytut Zachodni, German West-
Institut, French: L'Institut Occidental).The second oldest is the Polish
Institute of International Affairs (PISM) established in 1947. The other most
important state-sponsored think tank is the Centre for Eastern Studies (OSW),
which specialises in the post-Communist space. Among the private think tanks
the most important are: the Center for Social and Economic Research (CASE) and
Institute for Structural Research (IBS) on economic policy, The Casimir Pulaski
Foundation on foreign policy, demosEUROPA on EU affairs, the Institute of
Public Affairs (ISP) on social policy, the Center for International Affairs
(CSM) and The Sobieski Institute. Portugal. Contradit√≥rio think tank was
founded in 2008. Contradit√≥rio is a non-profit, independent and non-partisan
think tank. Romania. Romania's largest think tank is the Romanian Academic
Society (SAR), which was founded in 1996. Russia. According to the Foreign
Policy Research Institute, Russia has 112 think tanks, while Russian think
tanks claimed four of the top ten spots in 2011‚Äôs "Top Thirty Think Tanks in
Central and Eastern Europe". Serbia. Serbia's best known think thank is the
Foundation for the Advancement of Economics - FREN, founded in 2005 by the
Belgrade University‚Äôs Faculty of Economics. Thanks to the quality and
relevance of its research, FREN has established itself as one of the leading
economic think tanks in Serbia. FREN's team comprises a network of over 30
associates who regularly and systematically monitor economic trends in Serbia,
conduct in-depth research and encourage and facilitate the exchange of
information and availability of economic data. Slovakia. Besides the
international think tanks present in the surrounding countries as well (with
Open Society Foundations being the most notable one) Slovakia has a host of its
own think tanks as well, such as Institute of Public Affairs ("In≈°tit√∫t pre
verejn√© ot√°zky" or "IVO" in Slovak) and Forum Minority Research Institute
("F√≥rum Kisebbs√©gkutat√≥ Int√©zet" or "F√≥rum Int√©zet" in Hungarian and
"F√≥rum in≈°tit√∫t pre v√Ωskum men≈°√≠n" or "F√≥rum in≈°tit√∫t" in Slovak),
with the latter concentrating on minority issues. Since most of these
organizations are generally perceived to be associated with right-wing and
liberal parties of Slovakia (with the perception being particularly strong
among Slovak nationalists), findings and proposals made by these organizations
are generally resented or ignored by left-wing supporters and nationalists.,
k.h. Spain. In Spain, think tanks are progressively raising their public
profile. There are now at least 30 think tanks in the country. One of the most
influential Spanish think tanks is the Elcano Royal Institute, created in 2001
following the example of the Royal Institute of International Affairs (Chatham
House) in the UK, although it is closely linked to (and receives funding from)
the Socialist government in power. More independent but clearly to the left of
the political spectrum are the Centro de Investigaciones de Relaciones
Internacionales y Desarrollo (CIDOB) founded in 1973; and the Fundaci√≥n para
las Relaciones Internacionales y el Di√°logo Exterior (FRIDE) established in
1999 by Diego Hidalgo and main driving force behind projects such as the Club
de Madrid, a group of democratic former heads of state and government, or the
Foreign Policy Spanish Edition. Former Prime Minister Jos√© Maria Aznar
presides over the Fundaci√≥n para el Analisis y los Estudios Sociales (FAES), a
policy institute that is associated with the conservative Popular Party (PP).
Also linked to the PP is the Grupo de Estudios Estrat√©gicos (GEES), which is
known for its defense- and security-related research and analysis. For its
part, the Fundaci√≥n Alternativas is independent but close to left-wing ideas.
The Socialist Partido Socialista Obrero Espa√±ol (PSOE) has created a new think
tank called the Fundaci√≥n Ideas. More specialized think tanks has also emerged
in Spain during the past 10 years, like the Future Trends Forum from Bankinter
Foundation, a unique think tank in Europe, focused on detecting social,
economic, scientific and technological trends and analyzing their possible
application and impact on current business models. Sweden. The two biggest
think tanks in Sweden is the liberal oriented Timbro and center-left oriented
Agora. Others are Sektor3, SNS, FORES, Arbetarr√∂relsens Tankesmedja
(sociodemocratic oriented), Civitas (Christian democratic oriented) and Cogito
(Green oriented). Turkey. Turkish think tanks are relatively new. Many of them
are sister organizations of a political party or a company. University think
tanks are not typical think tanks. Most Turkish think tanks provide research
and ideas, yet they play less important roles in policy making when compared
with American think tanks. There are at least 20 think tanks in the country.
One of the most influential and oldest Turkish think tanks is the International
Strategic Research Organisation (USAK). Ukraine. Razumkov Centre Razumkov
Centre united experts in the fields of economy, energy, law, political
sciences, international relations, military security, land relations,
sociology, history and philosophy. The Centre has about 35 full-time employees,
and over 100 persons work on contractual basis. The Ukrainian-wide public
opinion polls of Razumkov Centre Sociological Service are carried out by over
300 interviewers. in the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine; In 2004, on the
International Economic Forum in Krynica (Poland) Razumkov Centre was named the
best non-governmental organisation of Eastern Europe. The Razumkov Centre is
listed among top-25 think tanks of the Central and Eastern Europe. The average
Centre‚Äôs yearly budget is approximately $600,000. http://www.razumkov.org.ua/
eng/pro_centr.php United Kingdom. In Britain, think tanks play a similar role
to the United States, attempting to shape policy, and indeed there is some
cooperation between British and American think tanks. For example, the London-
based think tank Chatham House and the Council on Foreign Relations were both
conceived at the Paris Peace Conference, 1919 and have remained sister
organisations. The Bow Group, founded in 1951, is the oldest centre-right think
tank and many of its members have gone on to serve as Members of Parliament or
Members of the European Parliament. Past chairmen have included Conservative
Party leader Michael Howard, Margaret Thatcher's longest-serving Cabinet
Minister Geoffrey Howe, Chancellor of the Exchequer Norman Lamont and former
British Telecom chairman Christopher Bland. United States think tanks. As the
classification is most often used today, the oldest American think tank is the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, founded in 1910. The Institute for
Government Research, which later merged with two organizations to form the
Brookings Institution, was formed in 1916. Other early twentieth century
organizations now classified as think tanks include the Hoover Institution
(1919), The Twentieth Century Fund (1919, and now known as the Century
Foundation), the National Bureau of Economic Research (1920), and the Council
on Foreign Relations. The Great Depression and its aftermath spawned several
economic policy organizations, such as the National Planning Association (1934)
and the Committee for Economic Development (1943). In collaboration with the
Douglas Aircraft Company, the Air Force set up the RAND Corporation in 1946 to
develop weapons technology and strategic defense analysis. In 1971 Lewis F.
Powell Jr. urged conservatives to retake command of public discourse by
"financing think tanks, reshaping mass media and seeking influence in
universities and the judiciary." In the following decades conservative policies
once considered outside the political mainstream‚Äîsuch as abolishing welfare,
privatizing Social Security, deregulating banking, embracing preemptive
war‚Äîwere taken seriously and sometimes passed into law thanks to the work of
the Hoover Institution, Heritage Foundation, the American Enterprise Institute
and smaller tanks. Think tanks help shape both foreign and domestic policy.
They receive funding from private donors, and members of private organizations.
Think tanks may feel more free to propose and debate controversial ideas than
people within government. The liberal media watchgroup Fairness and Accuracy in
Reporting (FAIR) has identified the top 25 think tanks by media citations,
noting that from 2006 to 2007 the number of citations declined 17%. The FAIR
report reveals the ideological breakdown of the citations: 37% conservative,
47% centrist, and 16% liberal. Their data show that the most-cited think tank
was the Brookings Institution, followed by the Council on Foreign Relations,
the American Enterprise Institute, the Heritage Foundation, and the Center for
Strategic and International Studies. A database of articles released by these
organizations can be found here: The Think Bank. Government. Government think
tanks are also important in the United States, particularly in the security and
defense field. These include the Institute for National Strategic Studies,
Institute for Homeland Security Studies, and the Center for Technology and
National Security Policy, at the National Defense University; the Center for
Naval Warfare Studies at the Naval War College and the Strategic Studies
Institute at the U.S. Army War College. The government funds, wholly or in
part, activities at approximately 30 Federally Funded Research and Development
Centers (FFRDCs). FFRDCs, are unique independent nonprofit entities sponsored
and funded by the U.S. government to meet specific long-term technical needs
that cannot be met by any other single organization. FFRDCs typically assist
government agencies with scientific research and analysis, systems development,
and systems acquisition. They bring together the expertise and outlook of
government, industry, and academia to solve complex technical problems. These
FFRDCs include the RAND Corporation, the MITRE Corporation, the Institute for
Defense Analyses, the Aerospace Corporation, the MIT Lincoln Laboratory, and
other organizations supporting various departments within the U.S. Government.
Similar to the above quasi-governmental organizations are Federal Advisory
Committees. These groups, sometimes referred to as commissions, are a form of
think tank dedicated to advising the US Presidents or the Executive branch of
government. They typically focus on a specific issue and as such, might be
considered similar to special interest groups. However, unlike special interest
groups these committees have come under some oversight regulation and are
required to make formal records available to the public. Approximately 1,000
these advisory committees are described in the FACA searchable database. Other
countries. Azerbaijan. According to research done by the University of
Pennsylvania, there are a total of 12 think tanks in Azerbaijan. The Center for
Economic and Social Development, or CESD; in Azeri, Azerbaijan, ƒ∞qtisadi v…ô
Sosial ƒ∞nki≈üaf M…ôrk…ôzi (ƒ∞Sƒ∞M) is an Azeri think tank, non-profit
organization, NGO based in Baku, Azerbaijan. The Center was established in
2005. CESD focuses on policy advocacy and reform, and is involved with policy
research and capacity building. CESD employs leading researchers prominent in
their fields and enjoys a broad regional and international network. CESD has
been set up to promote research into domestic and regional economic and social
issues, advocacy towards reforms and capacity building for the purpose to
positively impact the policy making and improve the participation. CESD ranked
as one of the top think tanks in the world by the University of Pennsylvania.
According to the University of Pennsylvania rankings ‚Äì a result of surveys
from 1500 scholars and peer review evaluation ‚Äì the Center for Economic and
Social Development (CESD) is one of the top 25 think tanks in Central and
Eastern Europe, including CIS. CESD is the only think tank from the Caucasus
and Central Asia included in the top think tanks rankings.CESD is also ranked
as one of the top 25 domestic economic policy thinks tanks in the world. Only
CESD (ranked 19) and the Center for Economic and Social Research (CASE),
(Poland, ranked 21) were included in the list from Central and Eastern Europe
and CIS countries. The Economic Research Center (ERC) is a policy-research
oriented non-profit think tank established in 1999 with a mission to facilitate
sustainable economic development and good governance in the new public
management system of Azerbaijan. It seeks to do this by building favorable
interactions between the public, private and civil society and working with
different networks both in local (EITI NGO Coalition, National Budget Group,
Public Coalition Against Poverty and etc.) and international levels (PWYP, IBP,
ENTO, ALDA, PASOS, WTO NGO Network etc.). Australia. Most Australian think
tanks are based at universities ‚Äì for example, the Melbourne Institute ‚Äì or
are government funded ‚Äì for example, the Productivity Commission or the
CSIRO. There are also about 20‚Äì30 "independent" Australian think tanks, which
are funded by private sources. The best-known of these think tanks play a much
more limited role in Australian public and business policy making than in the
United States. However, in the past decade the number of think tanks has
increased substantially. Prominent Australian conservative think tanks include
The Centre for Independent Studies, the Sydney Institute and the Institute of
Public Affairs. Prominent leftist Australian think tanks include Per Capita,
the Australia Institute, Lowy Institute and the Centre for Policy Development.
In recent years regionally based independent and non-partisan think tanks have
