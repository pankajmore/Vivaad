Gold standard The gold standard is a monetary system in which the standard
economic unit of account is a fixed weight of gold. There are distinct kinds of
gold standard. First, the "gold specie standard" is a system in which the
monetary unit is associated with circulating gold coins, or with the unit of
value defined in terms of one particular circulating gold coin in conjunction
with subsidiary coinage made from a less valuable metal. Similarly, the "gold
exchange standard" typically does not involve the circulation of gold coins,
instead using notes or coins made of silver or other metals, but where the
authorities guarantee a fixed exchange rate with another country that is on the
gold standard. This creates a "de facto" gold standard, in that the value of
the silver coins has a fixed external value in terms of gold that is
independent of the inherent silver value. Finally, the "gold bullion standard"
is a system in which gold coins do not circulate, but in which the authorities
have agreed to sell gold bullion on demand at a fixed price in exchange for the
circulating currency. No country currently uses the gold standard as the basis
of its monetary system, although several hold substantial gold reserves.
History. Beginnings. The gold specie standard was not designed, but rather
arose out of a general acceptance that gold was useful as a universal currency.
When commodities compete for the role of money, the one that over time loses
the least value takes on the role. The use of gold as money dates back
thousands of years. During the Middle Ages, the Byzantine gold Solidus,
commonly known as the "Bezant", circulated throughout Europe and the
Mediterranean. But as the Byzantine Empire's economic influence declined, the
European world tended to see silver, rather than gold, as the currency of
choice, leading to the development of a silver standard. Silver pennies, based
on the Roman Denarius, became the staple coin of Britain around the time of
King Offa, "circa" AD 796, and similar coins, including Italian "denari",
French "deniers", and Spanish "dineros" circulated throughout Europe. Following
the Spanish discovery of great silver deposits at PotosÃ­ in Bolivia and in
Mexico during the 16th century, international trade came to depend on coins
such as the Spanish dollar, Maria Theresa thaler, and, in the 1870s, the United
States Trade dollar. In modern times the British West Indies was one of the
first regions to adopt a gold specie standard. Following Queen Anne's
proclamation of 1704, the British West Indies gold standard was a "de facto"
gold standard based on the Spanish gold doubloon coin. In the year 1717, the
master of the Royal Mint Sir Isaac Newton established a new mint ratio between
silver and gold that had the effect of driving silver out of circulation and
putting Britain on a gold standard. However, only in 1821, following the
introduction of the gold sovereign coin by the new Royal Mint at Tower Hill in
the year 1816, was the United Kingdom formally put on a gold specie standard,
the first of the great industrial powers to do so. Soon to follow was Canada in
1853, Newfoundland in 1865, and the USA and Germany "de jure" in 1873. The USA
used the Eagle as its unit, and Germany introduced the new gold mark, while
Canada adopted a dual system based on both the American Gold Eagle and the
British Gold Sovereign. Australia and New Zealand adopted the British gold
standard, as did the British West Indies, while Newfoundland was the only
British Empire territory to introduce its own gold coin as a standard. Royal
Mint branches were established in Sydney, New South Wales, Melbourne, Victoria,
and Perth, Western Australia for the purpose of minting gold sovereigns from
Australia's rich gold deposits. The crisis of silver currency and bank notes
(1750â€“1870). In the late 18th century, wars within Europe as well as an
ongoing trade deficit with China (which sold to Europe but had little use for
European goods) drained silver from the economies of Western Europe and the
United States. Coins were struck in smaller and smaller numbers, and there was
a proliferation of bank and stock notes used as money. United Kingdom. In the
1790s, the United Kingdom, suffering a massive shortage of silver coinage,
ceased to mint larger silver coins and issued "token" silver coins and
overstruck foreign coins. With the end of the Napoleonic Wars, the United
Kingdom began a massive recoinage programme that created standard gold
sovereigns and circulating crowns and half-crowns, and eventually copper
farthings in 1821. The recoinage of silver in United Kingdom after a long
drought produced a burst of coins: the United Kingdom struck nearly 40 million
shillings between 1816 and 1820, 17 million half crowns and 1.3 million silver
crowns. The 1819 Act for the Resumption of Cash Payments set 1823 as the date
for resumption of convertibility, reached instead by 1821. Throughout the
1820s, small notes were issued by regional banks, which were finally restricted
in 1826, while the Bank of England was allowed to set up regional branches. In
1833, however, Bank of England notes were made legal tender, and redemption by
other banks was discouraged. In 1844 the Bank Charter Act established that Bank
of England notes, fully backed by gold, were the legal standard. According to
the strict interpretation of the gold standard, this 1844 act marks the
establishment of a full gold standard for British money. United States. The
United States adopted a silver standard based on the Spanish milled dollar in
1785. This was codified in the 1792 Mint and Coinage Act, and by the Federal
Government's use of the "Bank of the United States" to hold its reserves, as
well as establish a fixed ratio of gold to the U.S. dollar. This was, in
effect, a derivative silver standard, since the bank was not required to keep
silver to back all of its currency. This began a long series of attempts by the
USA to create a bi-metallic standard for the U.S. Dollar, which would continue
until the 1920s. Gold and silver coins were legal tender, including the Spanish
real, a silver coin struck in the Western Hemisphere. Because of the huge debt
taken on by the U.S. Federal Government to finance the Revolutionary War,
silver coins struck by the government left circulation, and in 1806 President
Jefferson suspended the minting of silver coins. The U.S. Treasury was put on a
strict hard-money standard, doing business only in gold or silver coin as part
of the Independent Treasury Act of 1848, which legally separated the accounts
of the Federal Government from the banking system. However, the fixed rate of
gold to silver overvalued silver in relation to the demand for gold to trade or
borrow from England. The drain of gold in favor of silver led to a search for
gold, including the California Gold Rush of 1849. Following Gresham's law,
silver poured into the USA, which traded with other silver nations, and gold
moved out. In 1853, the USA reduced the silver weight of coins to keep them in
circulation, and in 1857 removed legal tender status from foreign coinage. In
1857 the final crisis of the free banking era of international finance began as
American banks suspended payment in silver, rippling through the very young
international financial system of central banks. In 1861 the U.S. government
suspended payment in gold and silver, effectively ending the attempts to form a
silver standard basis for the dollar. International. Through the 1860â€“1871
period, various attempts to resurrect bi-metallic standards were made,
including one based on the gold and silver franc; however, with the rapid
influx of silver from new deposits, the expectation of scarcity of silver
ended. The interaction between central banking and currency basis formed the
primary source of monetary instability during this period. The combination that
produced economic stability was a restriction of supply of new notes, a
government monopoly on the issuance of notes directly and, indirectly, a
central bank and a single unit of value. Attempts to avoid these conditions
produced periodic monetary crises. As notes devalued, or silver ceased to
circulate as a store of value, or there was a depression, governments,
demanding specie as payment, drained the circulating medium out of the economy.
At the same time, there was a dramatically expanded need for credit, and large
banks were being chartered in various states, including, by 1872, Japan. The
need for a solid basis in monetary affairs would produce a rapid acceptance of
the gold standard in the period that followed. Japan. By way of example, and
following Germany's decision after the Franco-Prussian War (1870â€“1871) to
extract reparations to facilitate a move to the gold standard, Japan gained the
needed reserves after the Sino-Japanese War of 1894â€“1895. Whether the gold
standard provides a government sufficient bona fides when it seeks to borrow
abroad is debated. For Japan, moving to gold was considered vital for gaining
access to Western capital markets. The gold exchange standard (1870â€“1914).
Towards the end of the 19th century, some of the remaining silver standard
countries began to peg their silver coin units to the gold standards of the
United Kingdom or the USA. In 1898, British India pegged the silver rupee to
the pound sterling at a fixed rate of 1s 4d, while in 1906, the Straits
Settlements adopted a gold exchange standard against the pound sterling with
the silver Straits dollar being fixed at 2s 4d. Around the start of the 20th
century, the Philippines pegged the silver peso/dollar to the U.S. dollar at 50
cents. A similar pegging at 50 cents occurred at around the same time with the
silver peso of Mexico and the silver yen of Japan. When Siam adopted a gold
exchange standard in 1908, this left only China and Hong Kong on the silver
standard. When adopting the gold standard, many European nations changed the
name of their currency from Daler (Sweden and Denmark) or Gulden (Austria-
Hungary) to Crown, since the former names were traditionally associated with
silver coins and the latter with gold coins. Impact of World War I (1914â€“25).
Governments faced with the need to fund high levels of expenditure, but with
limited sources of tax revenue, suspended convertibility of currency into gold
on a number of occasions in the 19th century. The British government suspended
convertibility (that is to say, it went off the gold standard) during the
Napoleonic wars and the U.S. government during the US Civil War. In both cases,
convertibility was resumed after the war. The real test, however, came in the
form of World War I, a test "it failed utterly" according to economist Richard
Lipsey. In order to finance the cost of war, most belligerent countries went
off the gold standard during the war, and suffered significant inflation.
Because inflation levels varied between states, when they returned to the
standard after the war at price they determined themselves (some, for example,
chose to enter at pre-war prices), some countries' goods were undervalued and
some overvalued. Ultimately, the system as it stood could not deal quickly
enough with the large deficits and surpluses created in the balance of
payments; this has previously been attributed to increasing rigidity of wages
(particularly in terms of wage cuts) brought about by the advent of unionized
labor, but is now more likely thought of as an inherent fault with the system
which came to light under the pressures of war and rapid technological change.
In any case, prices had not reached equilibrium by the time of the Great
Depression, which served only to kill off the system completely. For example,
Germany had gone off the gold standard in 1914, and could not effectively
return to it as that country had lost much of its remaining gold reserves
because of reparations. The German central bank issued unbacked marks virtually
without limit to buy foreign currency for further reparations and to support
workers during the Occupation of the Ruhr, finally leading to hyperinflation in
the 1920s. The gold bullion standard and the decline of the gold standard
(1925â€“31). The gold specie standard ended in the United Kingdom and the rest
of the British Empire at the outbreak of World War I. Treasury notes replaced
the circulation of the gold sovereigns and gold half sovereigns. However,
legally, the gold specie standard was not repealed. The end of the gold
standard was successfully effected by appeals to patriotism when anybody
request the Bank of England to redeem his paper money for gold specie. It was
only in 1925, when Britain returned to the gold standard in conjunction with
Australia and South Africa, that the gold specie standard was officially ended.
The British Gold Standard Act 1925 both introduced the gold bullion standard
and simultaneously repealed the gold specie standard. The new gold bullion
standard did not envisage any return to the circulation of gold specie coins.
Instead, the law compelled the authorities to sell gold bullion on demand at a
fixed price, but only in the form of bars containing approximately four hundred
troy ounces of fine gold. This gold bullion standard lasted until 1931 when
speculative attacks on the pound forced Britain off the gold standard. Loans
from American and French Central Banks of Â£50,000,000, were insufficient and
exhausted in a matter of weeks. On September 19, 1931, the United Kingdom left
the revised gold standard, forced to suspend the gold bullion standard due to
large outflows of gold across the Atlantic Ocean. The British benefited from
the departure. They could now use monetary policy to stimulate the economy
through the lowering of interest rates. Australia and New Zealand had already
been forced off the gold standard by the same pressures connected with the
Great Depression, and Canada quickly followed suit with the United Kingdom. The
interwar partially backed gold standard was inherently unstable, because of the
conflict between (a) the expansion of sterling and dollar liabilities to
foreign central banks, and (b) the resulting deterioration in the reserve ratio
of the Bank of England, and U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve Banks. This
instability was enhanced by gold flows out of England, with its overvalued
pound, to other countries such as France, which was attempting to make Paris a
world class financial center, in competition with London and New York. It was
destabilizing speculation, emanating from lack of confidence in authorities'
commitment to currency convertibility that ended the interwar gold standard. In
May 1931 there was a run on Austria's largest commercial bank, and the bank
failed. The run spread to Germany, where an important bank also collapsed. The
countries' central banks lost substantial reserves; international financial
assistance was too late, and in July 1931 Germany adopted exchange control,
followed by Austria in October. These countries were definitively off the gold
standard. The Austrian and German experiences, as well as British budgetary and
political difficulties, were among the factors that destroyed confidence in
sterling, which occurred in mid-July 1931. Runs on sterling ensued, and the
Bank of England lost much of its reserves. Loans from abroad were insufficient,
and in any event taken as a sign of weakness. The gold standard was abandoned
in September, and the pound quickly and sharply depreciated on the foreign-
exchange market, as overvaluation of the pound would imply. Depression and
World War II (1932â€“46). Prolongation of the Great Depression. Some economic
historians, such as American professor Barry Eichengreen, blame the gold
standard of the 1920s for prolonging the Great Depression. Adherence to the
gold standard prevented the Federal Reserve from expanding the money supply in
order to stimulate the economy, fund insolvent banks and fund government
deficits which could "prime the pump" for an expansion. Once the US went off
the gold standard, it became free to engage in such money creation. The gold
standard limited the flexibility of the central banks' monetary policy by
limiting their ability to expand the money supply, and thus their ability to
lower interest rates. In the US, the Federal Reserve was required by law to
have 40% gold backing of its Federal Reserve demand notes, and thus, could not
expand the money supply beyond what was allowed by the gold reserves held in
their vaults. Others including Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Nobel
Prize winning economist Milton Friedman place most or all of the blame for the
severity of the Great Depression at the feet of the Federal Reserve, mostly due
to the deliberate tightening of monetary policy. The US economic contraction in
1937, the last gasp of the Great Depression, is blamed on tightening of
monetary policy by the Federal Reserve resulting in a higher cost of capital
and weaker securities markets, a reduced net government contribution to income,
the undistributed profits tax, and higher labor costs. As a result of the
tighter monetary policy, the money supply peaked in March 1937, with a trough
in May 1938. Higher interest rates intensified the deflationary pressure on the
dollar and reduced investment in U.S. banks. Commercial banks also converted
Federal Reserve Notes to gold in 1931, reducing the Federal Reserve's gold
reserves, and forcing a corresponding reduction in the amount of Federal
Reserve Notes in circulation. This speculative attack on the dollar created a
panic in the U.S. banking system. Fearing imminent devaluation of the dollar,
many foreign and domestic depositors withdrew funds from U.S. banks to convert
them into gold or other assets. As people pulled money from the banking system
due to bank panics, a reverse multiplier effect caused a contraction in the
money supply. Additionally the New York Fed had loaned over $150 million (over
240 tons) to European Central Banks to help them out with their difficulties.
This transfer of gold out of the US acted to contract the US money supply.
These loans became questionable once England, Germany, Austria and other
European countries went off the gold standard in 1931 and weakened confidence
in the dollar. The forced contraction of the money supply caused by people
removing funds from the banking system during the bank panics resulted in
deflation; and even as nominal interest rates dropped, inflation-adjusted real
interest rates remained high, rewarding those that held onto money instead of
spending it, causing a further slowdown in the economy. Recovery in the United
States was slower than in Britain, in part due to Congressional reluctance to
abandon the gold standard and float the U.S. currency as Britain had done. In
the early 1930s, the Federal Reserve defended the fixed price of dollars in
respect to the gold standard by raising interest rates, trying to increase the
demand for dollars. Its commitment and adherence to the gold standard explain
why the U.S. did not engage in expansionary monetary policy. To compete in the
international economy, the U.S. maintained high interest rates. This helped
attract international investors who bought foreign assets with gold. Congress
passed the Gold Reserve Act on 30 January 1934; the measure nationalized all
gold by ordering the Federal Reserve banks to turn over their supply to the
U.S. Treasury. In return the banks received gold certificates to be used as
reserves against deposits and Federal Reserve notes. The act also authorized
the president to devalue the gold dollar so that it would have no more than 60
percent of its existing weight. Under this authority the president, on 31
January 1934, changed the value of the dollar from $20.67 to the troy ounce to
$35 to the troy ounce, a devaluation of over 40%. Other factors in the
prolongation of the Great Depression include trade wars and the reduction in
international trade caused by trade barriers such as Smoot-Hawley Tarriff in
the US and the Imperial Preference policies of Great Britain, the failure of
central banks to act responsibly, government policies designed to prevent wages
from falling, such as the Davis-Bacon Act of 1931, during the deflationary
period resulting in production costs dropping slower then sales prices and
thereby injuring business profitability and increases in taxes to reduce budget
deficits and to support new programs such as Social Security. The US top
marginal income tax rate went from 25% to 63% in 1932 and to 79% in 1936 while
the bottom rate increased over 10 fold from .375% in 1929 to 4% in 1932
Successful attacks on partially backed currencies which forced many countries
off the gold standard and reduced confidence in the financial system, and a
financial system, further damaged by the bank panics of the 1930s were also
factors, as was inclement weather such as the drought resulting in the US Dust
Bowl. Milton Friedman stated that "the severity of each of the major
contractions â€” 1920-1, 1929-33 and 1937-8 is directly attributable to acts of
commission and omission by the Reserve authorities" He further believes that
the US got out of the Great Depression because of the "natural resiliency of
the economy and WW2, and not due to any acts of government, which in general
were "very destructive" and extended the Great Depression. Barry Eichengreen
believes that the Austrian School view that the Great Depression was the result
of a credit bust has much to recommend it. Alan Greenspan wrote that the bank
failures of the 1930s were sparked by Great Britain dropping the gold standard
in 1931. This act "tore asunder" any remaining confidence in the banking
system. Financial historian Niall Ferguson writes that what made the Great
Depression truly 'great' was the European banking crisis of 1931. According to
Fed Chairman M. Eccles, the root cause of the Great Depression was a
concentration of wealth resulting in a stagnating or reduction in the standard
of living for the poor and middle class. In an attempt to maintain and/or
improve their standard of living these classes went into debt, resulting in the
huge credit explosion of the 1920s. Eventually the debt load grew so heavy that
it could not be sustained, resulting in the massive defaults and financial
panics of the 1930s. British hesitate to return to gold standard. John Maynard
Keynes, who had argued against such a gold standard, proposed to put the power
to print money in the hands of the privately owned Bank of England. Keynes, in
warning about the menaces of inflation, said, "By a continuous process of
inflation, governments can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important
part of the wealth of their citizens. By this method, they not only confiscate,
but they confiscate arbitrarily; and while the process impoverishes many, it
actually enriches some". Quite possibly because of this, the 1944 Bretton Woods
Agreement established the International Monetary Fund and an international
monetary system based on convertibility of the various national currencies into
a U.S. dollar that was in turn convertible into gold. Post-war international
gold-dollar standard (1946â€“1971). After the Second World War, a system
similar to a Gold Standard and sometimes described as a "gold exchange
standard" was established by the Bretton Woods Agreements. Under this system,
many countries fixed their exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. The U.S.
promised to fix the price of gold at approximately $35 per ounce. Implicitly,
then, all currencies pegged to the dollar also had a fixed value in terms of
gold. Starting under the administration of the French President Charles de
Gaulle and continuing until 1970, France reduced its dollar reserves, trading
them for gold from the U.S. government, thereby reducing U.S. economic
influence abroad. This, along with the fiscal strain of federal expenditures
for the Vietnam War and persistent balance of payments deficits, led President
Richard Nixon to end the direct convertibility of the dollar to gold on August
15, 1971, resulting in the system's breakdown (the "Nixon Shock"). Theory.
Commodity money is inconvenient to store and transport. Further, it does not
allow a government to manipulate or restrict the flow of commerce within its
dominion with the same ease that a fiat currency does. As such, commodity money
gave way to representative money, and gold and other specie were retained as
its backing. Gold was a common form of money due to its rarity, durability,
divisibility, fungibility, and ease of identification, often in conjunction
with silver. Silver was typically the main circulating medium, with gold as the
metal of monetary reserve. The gold standard variously specified how the gold
backing would be implemented, including the amount of specie per currency unit.
The currency itself is just paper and so has no "intrinsic" value, but is
accepted by traders because it can be redeemed any time for the equivalent
specie. A U.S. silver certificate, for example, could be redeemed for an actual
piece of silver. Representative money and the gold standard protect citizens
from hyperinflation and other abuses of monetary policy, as were seen in some
countries during the Great Depression. However, they were not without their
problems and critics, and so were partially abandoned via the international
adoption of the Bretton Woods System. That system eventually collapsed in 1971,
at which time nearly all nations had switched to full fiat money. According to
Keynesian analysis, the earliness with which a country left the gold standard
reliably predicted its economic recovery from the great depression. For
example, Great Britain and Scandinavia, which left the gold standard in 1931,
recovered much earlier than France and Belgium, which remained on gold much
longer. Countries such as China, which had a silver standard, almost avoided
the depression entirely. The connection between leaving the gold standard as a
strong predictor of that country's severity of its depression and the length of
time of its recovery has been shown to be consistent for dozens of countries,
including developing countries. This may explain why the experience and length
of the depression differed between national economies. Differing definitions. A
100%-reserve gold standard, or a full gold standard, exists when a monetary
authority holds sufficient gold to convert all of the representative money it
has issued into gold at the promised exchange rate. It is sometimes referred to
as the gold specie standard to more easily identify it from other forms of the
gold standard that have existed at various times. Opponents of a 100%-reserve
standard consider a 100%-reserve standard difficult to implement, saying that
the quantity of gold in the world is too small to sustain current worldwide
economic activity at current gold prices; implementation would entail a many-
fold increase in the price of gold. However, proponents of the gold standard
have said that any amount of gold can serve as the reserve: "Once a money is
established, any stock of money becomes compatible with any amount of
employment and real income." According to them the prices of goods and services
will adjust to the supply of gold. In an international gold-standard system
(which is necessarily based on an internal gold standard in the countries
concerned), gold or a currency that is convertible into gold at a fixed price
is used as a means of making international payments. Under such a system, when
exchange rates rise above or fall below the fixed mint rate by more than the
cost of shipping gold from one country to another, large inflows or outflows
occur until the rates return to the official level. International gold
standards often limit which entities have the right to redeem currency for
gold. Under the Bretton Woods system, these were called "SDRs" for special
drawing rights. Advocates of a renewed gold standard. The return to the gold
standard is supported by many followers of the Austrian School of Economics,
Objectivists, free-market libertarians and, in the United States, by strict
constitutionalists largely because they object to the role of the government in
issuing fiat currency through central banks. A significant number of gold-
standard advocates also call for a mandated end to fractional-reserve banking.
Few politicians today advocate a return to the gold standard, other than
adherents of the Austrian school and some supply-siders. However, some
prominent economists have expressed sympathy with a hard-currency basis, and
have argued against politically-controlled fiat money, including former U.S.
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan (himself a former Objectivist), and
macro-economist Robert Barro. Greenspan famously argued the case for returning
to a 'pure' gold standard in his 1966 paper "Gold and Economic Freedom", in
which he described supporters of fiat currencies as "welfare statists"
intending to use monetary policies to finance deficit spending. Barro argues in
favor of adopting some form of "monetary constitution" that will provide
stability to monetary policy rather than allowing decisions about monetary
policy to be made on the basis of politics, but suggests that what form this
constitution takesâ€”for example, a gold standard, some other commodity-based
standard, or a fiat currency with fixed rules for determining the quantity of
moneyâ€”is considerably less important. U.S. Congressman Ron Paul has
continually argued for the reinstatement of the gold standard, but is no longer
a strict advocate, instead supporting a basket of commodities that emerges on
the free markets. For the time being, the global monetary system continues to
rely on the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency by which major transactions, such
as the price of gold itself, are measured. A host of alternatives has been
suggested, including energy-based currencies, and market baskets of currencies
or commodities, gold being one of the alternatives. In 2001, Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad proposed a new currency that would be used
initially for international trade among Muslim nations. The currency he
proposed was called the Islamic gold dinar and it was defined as 4.25Â grams of
pure (24-carat) gold. Mahathir Mohamad promoted the concept on the basis of its
economic merits as a stable unit of account and also as a political symbol to
create greater unity between Islamic nations. The purported purpose of this
move would be to reduce dependence on the United States dollar as a reserve
currency, and to establish a non-debt-backed currency in accord with Islamic
law against the charging of interest. However, to date, Mahathir's proposed
gold-dinar currency has failed to take hold. In 2011, the legislature of the
state of Utah passed a bill to accept federally issued gold and silver coins as
legal tender to pay taxes. Similar legislation is under consideration in a
number of other US states. Gold as a reserve today. The Swiss Franc was based
on a 40% legal gold-reserve requirement from 1936, when it ended gold
convertibility, until 2000. Gold reserves are held in significant quantity by
many nations as a means of defending their currency, and hedging against the
U.S. Dollar, which forms the bulk of liquid currency reserves. Both gold coins
and gold bars are traded in liquid markets and serve as a private store of
wealth.
