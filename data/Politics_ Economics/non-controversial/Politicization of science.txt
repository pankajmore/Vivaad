Politicization of science The politicization of science is the manipulation of
science for political gain. It occurs when government, business, or advocacy
groups use legal or economic pressure to influence the findings of scientific
research or the way it is disseminated, reported or interpreted. The
politicization of science may also negatively affect academic and scientific
freedom. Historically, groups have conducted various campaigns to promote their
interests in defiance of scientific consensus, and in an effort to manipulate
public policy. Overview. Researcher William R. Freudenburg and colleagues have
noted that where decisions and action are required, science can offer valuable
degrees of certainty, however, it can never offer a guarantee. John Horgan
describes how this point is sometimes intentionally ignored as a part of what
he calls an "Orwellian tactic". Organizations sometimes seek to shift all
discussion on some issues away from 'conclusions are most scientifically
likely' to 'even the more probable conclusion is still uncertain.' Chris Mooney
has claimed these tactics are used to gain more attention for views that have
been undermined by scientific evidence. In his view, the media ends up in a
misguided pursuit of "balance" which results in undue weight in reporting. As
examples, Mooney offers the Teach the Controversy campaign that seeks to cast
doubt on some aspects of evolutionary explanations, and other campaigns that
seek to cast doubt on certain aspects of anthropogenic climate change. William
R. Freudenburg and colleagues have written about this rhetorical technique, and
state that this is an attempt to shift the burden of proof in an argument.
Cigarette lobbyists combating laws that would control smoking via triavializing
evidence as uncertain, is offered as an example of a SCAM (Scientific Certainty
Argumentation Method). They maintain that what is needed is a balanced approach
that carefully considers the risks of both Type 1 and Type 2 errors in a
situation while noting that scientific conclusions are always tentative. The
authors conclude that politicians and lobby groups are too often able to make
"successful efforts to argue for full 'scientific certainty' before a
regulation can be said to be 'justified'Â â€” and that, in short, is a SCAM."
Historical examples. Soviet Union. In the Soviet Union, scientific research was
under strict political control. A number of research areas were declared
"bourgeois pseudoscience" and forbidden. This has led to significant setbacks
for the Soviet science, notably in biology due to ban on genetics (see
"Lysenkoism") and in computer science, which drastically influenced the Soviet
economy and technology. Tobacco and cancer. By the mid-1950s there was a
scientific consensus that smoking promotes lung cancer, but the tobacco
industry fought the findings, both in the public eye and within the scientific
community. Tobacco companies funded think tanks and lobbying groups, started
health reassurance campaigns, ran advertisements in medical journals, and
researched alternate explanations for lung cancer, such as pollution, asbestos
and even pet birds. Denying the case against tobacco was "closed," they called
for more research as a tactic to delay regulation. John Horgan, notes a
rhetoric tactic that has been used by tobacco companies. It is summarized in a
line that appeared in a confidential memo from a tobacco company, in 1969, when
they sought to cast doubt on evidence that supports smoking causes cancer. It
read, "Doubt is our product since it is the best means of competing with the
'body of fact' that exists in the mind of the general public. It is also the
means of establishing a controversy." Eugenics. Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler
was well known for Eugenics programs which attempted to maintain a "pure"
German race through a series of programs that ran under the banner of Racial
Hygiene. The Nazis manipulated scientific research in Germany, by forcing some
scholars to emigrate, and by allocating funding for research based on
ideological rather than scientific merit. In the early 20th century, Eugenics
enjoyed substantial international support, from leading politicians and
scientists. The First International Congress of Eugenics in 1912 was supported
by many prominent persons, including: its president Leonard Darwin, the son of
Charles Darwin; honorary vice-president Winston Churchill, then First Lord of
the Admiralty and future Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; Auguste Forel,
famous Swiss pathologist; Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone;
among other prominent people. The level of support for Eugenics research by the
Nazis prompted an American Eugenics advocate to seek an expansion of the
American program, with the complaint that "the Germans are beating us at our
own game". There was a strong connection between American and Nazi Eugenics
research. Nazis based their Eugenics program on the United States' programs of
forced sterilization, especially on the eugenics laws that had been enacted in
California. Recent examples. George W. Bush administration. In 2004, The
"Denver Post" reported that that George W. Bush administration "has installed
more than 100 top officials who were once lobbyists, attorneys or spokespeople
for the industries they oversee." At least 20 of these former industry
advocates helped their agencies write, shape or push for policy shifts that
benefit their former industries. "They knew which changes to make because they
had pushed for them as industry advocates." Also in 2004, the scientific
advocacy group Union of Concerned Scientists issued a report, "Scientific
Integrity in Policymaking: An Investigation into the Bush Administration's
Misuse of Science" which charged the following: "A growing number of
scientists, policy makers, and technical specialists both inside and outside
the government allege that the current Bush administration has suppressed or
distorted the scientific analyses of federal agencies to bring these results in
line with administration policy. In addition, these experts contend that
irregularities in the appointment of scientific advisors and advisory panels
are threatening to upset the legally mandated balance of these bodies." A
petition, signed on February 18, 2004, by more than 9,000 scientists, including
49 Nobel laureates and 63 National Medal of Science recipients, followed the
report. The petition stated: "When scientific knowledge has been found to be in
conflict with its political goals, the administration has often manipulated the
process through which science enters into its decisions. This has been done by
placing people who are professionally unqualified or who have clear conflicts
of interest in official posts and on scientific advisory committees; by
disbanding existing advisory committees; by censoring and suppressing reports
by the governmentâ€™s own scientists; and by simply not seeking independent
scientific advice. Other administrations have, on occasion, engaged in such
practices, but not so systematically nor on so wide a front. Furthermore, in
advocating policies that are not scientifically sound, the administration has
sometimes misrepresented scientific knowledge and misled the public about the
implications of its policies." The same year, Francesca Grifo, executive
director of the Union of Concerned Scientists' Scientific Integrity Program,
stated "We have reports that stay in draft form and don't get out to the
public. We have reports that are changed. We have reports that are ignored and
overwritten." In response to criticisms, President Bush in 2006 unveiled a
campaign in his State of the Union Address to promote scientific research and
education to ensure American competitiveness in the world, vowing to "double
the federal commitment to the most critical basic research programs in the
physical sciences over the next 10 years." Surgeon General. Dr. Richard
Carmona, the first surgeon general appointed by President George W. Bush,
publicly accused the administration in July 2007 of political interference and
muzzling him on key issues like embryonic stem cell research. "Anything that
doesn't fit into the political appointees' ideological, theological or
political agenda is often ignored, marginalized or simply buried," Carmona
testified. Although he did not make personal accusations, the Washington Post
reported on July 29 that the official who blocked at least one of Carmona's
reports was William R. Steiger. Food and Drug Administration. In July 2006 the
Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) released survey results that demonstrate
pervasive political influence of science at the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA). Of the 997 FDA scientists who responded to the survey, nearly one fifth
(18.4 percent) said that they "have been asked, for non-scientific reasons, to
inappropriately exclude or alter technical information or their conclusions in
a FDA scientific document." This is the third survey Union of Concerned
Scientists has conducted to examine inappropriate interference with science at
federal agencies. The Department of Health and Human Services also conducted a
survey addressing the same topic which generated similar findings. According to
"USA Today", a survey of Food and Drug Administration scientists by Public
Employees for Environmental Responsibility and the Union of Concerned
Scientists found that many scientists have been pressured to approve or reject
new drugs despite their scientific findings concerns. In July 2006, the Union
of Concerned Scientists released survey results that they said "demonstrate
pervasive political influence of science" at the Food and Drug Administration.
United States Department of the Interior. On May 1, 2007, deputy assistant
secretary at the United States Department of the Interior Julie MacDonald
resigned after the Interior Department Inspector General, Honorable Earl E.
Devaney, reported that MacDonald broke federal rules by giving non-public,
internal government documents to oil industry and property rights groups, and
manipulated scientific findings to favor Bush policy goals and assist land
developers. On November 29, 2007, another report by the Devaney found that
MacDonald could have also benefitted financially from a decision she was
involved with to remove the Sacramento splittail fish from the federal
endangered species list. MacDonald's conduct violated the Code of Federal
Regulations (CFR) under 5 C.F.R. Â§ 2635.703 Use of nonpublic information and 5
C.F.R. Â§ 2635.101 Basic obligation of public service. MacDonald resigned a
week before a House congressional oversight committee was to hold a hearing on
accusations that she had "violated the Endangered Species Act, censored science
and mistreated staff of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service." Intelligent
design. The intelligent design movement associated with the Discovery
Institute, has been accused of seeking to "defeat materialist world view"
represented by the theory of evolution in favor of "a science consonant with
Christian and theistic convictions". The Discovery Institute portrays evolution
as a "theory in crisis" with scientists criticizing evolution and that
"fairness" and "equal time" requires educating students about "the
controversy." Some scientific community and science education organizations
state that any controversial aspects of evolution are a matter of religion and
politics, not science. The 2005 ruling in the Dover trial, Kitzmiller v. Dover
Area School District, where the claims of intelligent design proponents were
considered by a United States federal court concluded that intelligent design
is not science, that it "cannot uncouple itself from its creationist, and thus
religious, antecedents", and concluded that the school district's promotion of
it therefore violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the
U.S. Constitution. A 2006 article in scientific journal "Science", said the
reason that among the thirty-four developed countries surveyed, the U.S. ranks
second from last in the number of adults who accept the theory of evolution:
"The acceptance of evolution is lower in the United States than in Japan or
Europe, largely because of widespread fundamentalism and the politicization of
science in the United States." Global warming. Both mainstream climatologists
and global warming skeptics have accused each other of politicizing the science
behind climate change. In 1991, a US corporate coalition including the National
Coal Association, the Western Fuels Association and Edison Electrical Institute
created a public relations organization called the "Information Council on the
Environment" (ICE). ICE launched a $500,000 advertising campaign to, in ICE's
own words, "reposition global warming as theory (not fact)." Critics of
industry groups have charged that the claims about a global warming controversy
are part of a deliberate effort to reduce the impact any international treaty,
such as the Kyoto Protocol, might have on their business interests. In June
2005, John Vidal, environment editor of "The Guardian", asserted the existence
of US State Department papers showing that the Bush administration thanked
Exxon executives for the company's "active involvement" in helping to determine
climate change policy, including the US stance on Kyoto. Input from the
industry advocacy group Global Climate Coalition was also a factor. In 2006,
"Guardian" columnist George Monbiot reported that according to data found in
official Exxon documents, 124 organizations have taken money from ExxonMobil or
worked closely with those that have, and that "These organizations take a
consistent line on climate change: that the science is contradictory, the
scientists are split, environmentalists are charlatans, liars or lunatics, and
if governments took action to prevent global warming, they would be endangering
the global economy for no good reason. The findings these organisations dislike
are labelled 'junk science'. The findings they welcome are labelled 'sound
science'." The "selective use of data", cherry picking, is identified as a
notable form of scientific abuse by the Pacific Institute, an organization
created to provide independent research and policy analysis on issues at the
intersection of development, environment, and security. In December 2007, the
"Christian Science Monitor" reported that at least since 2003, and especially
after hurricane Katrina, the George W. Bush administration has broadly
attempted to control which climate scientists could speak with reporters, as
well as edited scientists' congressional testimony on climate science and key
legal opinions. Those who have studied organizations set up to delay action and
manufacture uncertainty about well established scientific consensus have
divided their tactics into three basic categories: first deny there is a
problem, second, make the case that it's not a problem and may actually be
beneficial, and failing that to admit it's a problem but insist there's nothing
anyone can do about it. Waxman report. In August 2003, United States,
Democratic Congressman Henry A. Waxman and the staff of the Government Reform
Committee released a report concluding that the administration of George W.
Bush had politicized science and sex education. The report accuses the
administration of modifying performance measures for abstinence-based programs
to make them look more effective. The report also found that the Bush
administration had appointed Dr. Joseph McIlhaney, a prominent advocate of
abstinence-only program, to the Advisory Committee to the director of the
Centers for Disease Control. According to the report, information about
comprehensive sex education was removed from the CDC's website. Other issues
considered for removal included agricultural pollution, the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge and breast cancer; the report found that a National Cancer
Institute website has been changed to reflect the administration view that
there may be a risk of breast cancer associated with abortions. The website was
updated after protests and now holds that no such risk has been found in
recent, well-designed studies. Abortionâ€“breast cancer hypothesis. The
abortion-breast cancer hypothesis is the belief that induced abortions increase
the risk of developing breast cancer. This belief is in contrast to the
scientific consensus that there is no evidence suggesting that abortions can
cause breast cancer. Despite the scientific community rejecting the hypothesis,
many pro-life advocates continue to argue that a link between abortions and
breast cancer exists, in an effort to influence public policy and opinion to
further restrict abortions and discourage women from having abortions. While
historically a controversial hypothesis, the debate now is almost entirely
political rather than scientific. The most notable example of the
politicization of this topic was the modification of the National Cancer
Institute (NCI) fact sheet by the George W. Bush administration from concluding
no link to a more ambiguous assessment regarding the abortion-breast cancer
hypothesis, despite the NCI's scientifically-based assessment to the contrary.
US House of Representatives Science Oversight and Investigation subcommittee.
In January 2007, the House Committee on Science and Technology announced the
formation of a new subcommittee, the Science Subcommittee on Investigations and
Oversight, which handles investigative and oversight activities on matters
covering the committee's entire jurisdiction. The subcommittee has authority to
look into a whole range of important issues, particularly those concerning
manipulation of scientific data at Federal agencies. In an interview,
subcommitte chairman Rep. Brad Miller pledged to "look into...scientific
integrity issues under the Bush Administration. There have been lots of reports
in the press of manipulating science to support policy, rigging advisory
panels, and suppressing research by federal employees or with federal dollars.
I've written about that here before, and you interviewed me a year ago about
the manipulation of science. In addition to the published reports, the
committee staff has been collecting accounts, some confidential, of
interference by political appointees. I hope that more folks will come forward
now that Democrats are in the majority and we show we're really going to pursue
the issue." Scholarly studies of the politics of science. The politicization of
science is a subset of a broader topic, the politics of science, which has been
studied by scholars in a variety of fields, including most notably Science and
Technology Studies; history of science; political science; and the sociology of
science, knowledge, and technology. Increasingly in recent decades, these
fields have examined the process through which science and technology are
shaped. Some of the scholarly work in this area is reviewed in "The Handbook of
Science & Technology Studies" (1995, 2008), a collection of literature reviews
published by the Society for Social Studies of Science. There is an annual
award for books relevant to the politics of science given by the Society for
Social Studies of Science called the Rachel Carson Prize.
