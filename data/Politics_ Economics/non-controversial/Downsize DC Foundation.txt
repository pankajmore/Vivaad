Downsize DC Foundation Downsize DC (formerly known as the American Liberty
Foundation) is a policy advocacy organization which aims to limit the size of
government in the United States through awareness and petitioning. Though it
claims to be non-partisan, it does have strong political ties to the
libertarian movement. It was founded by two-time Libertarian presidential
candidate Harry Browne, his former campaign staff members Perry Willis and Jim
Babka, and former National Chair of the Libertarian Party Steve Dasbach. It is
split into two organizations, the Downsize DC Foundation and DownsizeDC.org,
for tax purposes. The President of Downsize DC is Jim Babka. Harry Browne
served for over a year as the Director of Public Policy. The Chair of
DownsizeDC.org is Gary Nolan. Mark Cenci and David Page both also serve on the
Board of Directors. The chair of the Downsize DC Foundation is Jack Mullen.
Along with Jim Babka, Laura Carno, John McAlister, and David Ruprecht also
serve on the Downsize DC Foundation Board of Directors. DownsizeDC.org focuses
both on preventing what it considers "bad" legislation - generally, legislation
that grows government - from passing through Congress and on pushing for
legislation that would reduce the size of or constrain the growth of
government.
