Section 28 Section 28 of the Local Government Act 1988 caused the controversial
addition of Section 2A to the Local Government Act 1986 (affecting England,
Wales and Scotland), enacted on 24 May 1988 and repealed on 21 June 2000 in
Scotland, and on 18 November 2003 in the rest of Great Britain by section 122
of the Local Government Act 2003. The amendment stated that a local authority
"shall not intentionally promote homosexuality or publish material with the
intention of promoting homosexuality" or "promote the teaching in any
maintained school of the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family
relationship". Because it did not create a criminal offence, no prosecution was
ever brought under this provision, but its existence caused many groups to
close or limit their activities or self-censor. For example, a number of
lesbian, gay and bisexual student support groups in schools and colleges across
Britain were closed owing to fears by council legal staff that they could
breach the Act. While going through Parliament, the amendment was constantly
relabelled with a variety of clause numbers as other amendments were added to
or deleted from the Bill, but by the final version of the Bill, which received
Royal Assent, it had become Section 28. Section 28 is sometimes referred to as
Clause 28 â€“ in the United Kingdom, Acts of Parliament have sections, whereas
in a Bill (which is put before Parliament to pass) those sections are called
clauses. Since the effect of the amendment was to insert a new section '2A'
into the previous Local Government Act, it was also sometimes referred to as
Section 2A. History. Background. Section 28 originated in the social transition
in British society from homosexuality as "illegal-but-discussed", to "legal-
but-not-always approved", following debate in the 1950s and the 1967
decriminalisation of homosexual acts for those over the age of 21 in the Sexual
Offences Act 1967. The 1980s was the era of Margaret Thatcher's Government,
which brought large-scale social changes ("see: Thatcherism"); it was also the
era in which AIDS was first reported. The spread of AIDS brought about
widespread fear, much of which was directed at homosexuals and bisexuals. The
first recorded victims of the disease were a group of homosexual men, and the
disease became associated in the media, and at first even in medical circles,
with homosexuals in particular. This encouraged negative sentiments toward
homosexuals, which intensified already-existing opposition to school policies,
activities, and practices, which supporters claimed were efforts to be
inclusive of sexual minorities, and which opponents deemed as the promotion of
homosexuality. Given the domination of central government by conservative
thinking, most gay rights activists were to be found in the Labour Party or the
Liberal Party. These campaigners and their supporters progressively managed to
raise these issues in local party meetings, resulting in a number of local
authorities changing their policies to include the words "sexual orientation"
in a list of unacceptable discriminations. The large Metropolitan Borough
councils outside the capital, the Inner London Education Authority and the
Greater London Council (GLC) regularly took out job adverts in the national
press and elsewhere making a very public statement about the unacceptability of
homophobic behaviour within their organisations.The GLC also directly started
funding gay groups. Between 1981 and 1984 grants totalling at least Â£292,548
were given by the GLC to a variety of small gay groups and another Â£751,000
was committed towards the setting up of the London Lesbian and Gay Community
Centre in Islington. About ten of the 32 local authorities in London, most
prominently Islington and Haringey were also funding gay groups at that time,
one report estimating that these boroughs and the GLC together donated more
than Â£600,000 to gay projects and groups during 1984. In 1983 the "Daily
Mail", a British tabloid newspaper, reported that a copy of a book entitled
"Jenny lives with Eric and Martin"â€”portraying a little girl who lives with
her father and his homosexual partnerâ€”was provided in a school library run by
the Labour-controlled Inner London Education Authority. More and more councils
began to adopt wide-ranging anti-discrimination policies (particularly Ealing,
Islington, Camden and Manchester who employed officers to counter homophobia).
The attention to this, and work within the political parties by activists, led
to the adoption at the Labour Party Annual Conference in 1985 of a resolution
calling for the end of all legal discrimination against homosexuals. In
addition, the election to Manchester City Council of Margaret Roff (November
1985) as the UK's first openly homosexual Mayor and the publication of Changing
The World by the GLC in 1985 all fuelled a heightened public awareness of the
issues. But it was not until 1986 that major controversy arose and widespread
protest demonstrations made a major contribution towards the subsequent passing
of Section 28.Susanne Bosche Jenny, Eric, Martin ... and me, "The Guardian",
January 31, 2000. Accessed online July 1, 2006. Legislation. As a consequence,
many Conservative backbench MPs became concerned that left-wing councils were
indoctrinating young children with what they considered to be homosexual
propaganda. In 1986 Lord Halsbury first tabled a Private Member's Bill in the
House of Lords entitled "An act to refrain local authorities from promoting
homosexuality". At the time, the incumbent Conservative government considered
Halsbury's bill to be too misleading and risky. The bill successfully passed
the House of Lords and was adopted by then-Conservative MP Jill Knight.
However, overshadowed by the 1987 general election, Halsbury's bill failed. On
2 December 1987 in Committee, Conservative MP David Wilshire re-introduced an
amendment to the 1988 Local Government Bill for a similar clause, entitled
"Clause 28". The government agreed to support the tabling of the amendment in
exchange for Knight forgoing her place on the Health and Medicines Bill
standing committee, and the amendment received the support of the then-Minister
for Local Government, Michael Howard. After being debated on 8 December 1987 it
was presented to the House of Commons on 15 December 1987, shortly before the
parliamentary Christmas recess. Section 28 became law on 24 May 1988. The night
before, several protests were staged by lesbian women, including abseiling into
Parliament and a famous invasion of the BBC's Six O'Clock News, during which
one woman managed to chain herself to Sue Lawley's desk and was sat on by the
newscaster Nicholas Witchell. Controversy over applicability. After Section 28
was passed, there was some debate as to whether it actually applied in schools
or whether it applied only to local authorities. Whilst head teachers and
Boards of Governors were specifically exempt, schools and teachers became
confused as to what was actually permitted and tended to err on the side of
caution. A National Union of Teachers (NUT) statement remarked that "While
Section 28 applies to local authorities and not to schools, many teachers
believe, albeit wrongly, that it imposes constraints in respect of the advice
and counselling they give to pupils. Professional judgement is therefore
influenced by the perceived prospect of prosecution." In response to these
criticisms, supporters claimed that the NUT and Department of Education were
mistaken, and the section did affect schools. Some local authorities continued
to deliver training to their staff in their education system on how to deliver
their services without discrimination against homosexuals. Manchester City
Council continued to sustain four officer posts directly involved in policy
making and implementation, contributing to the 1992 report ("Section 28 of the
Local Government Act 1988: a Guide for Workers in the Education Service,
produced by Manchester City Council, May 1992.") which proved that Section 28
did not prevent this work. Their pioneering work was never once challenged by
the act. Before its repeal, Section 28 was already largely redundant: sex
education in England and Wales has been regulated solely by the Secretary of
State for Education since the Learning and Skills Act 2000 and the Education
Act 1996. Nevertheless, many liberal and conservative campaigners still saw
Section 28 as a symbolic issue and continued to fight their own particular
causes over it until its repeal. Political response. The introduction of
Section 28 served to galvanise the disparate British gay rights movement into
action. The resulting protest saw the rise of now famous groups like Stonewall,
started by, amongst other people, Ian McKellen, and OutRage!, subsequently led
by Peter Tatchell.Schools OUT which had been formed back in 1974 worked
tirelessly both against the act and supported and trained teachers on how to
counter homophobia and make LGBT people visible in schools. While the gay
rights movement was united over Section 28, the issue began to divide the
Conservative party, heightening divisions between party modernists and
traditionalists. In 1999 Conservative leader William Hague controversially
sacked frontbencher Shaun Woodward for refusing to support the party line that
Section 28 should not be repealed, prompting pro-gay rights Conservatives, such
as Steve Norris, to speak out against the decision. 2000 saw gay Conservative
advisor Ivan Massow defect to the Labour Party in response to the Conservative
Party's continued support of Section 28. There is only one case of Section 28
being used to bring a case to the courts against a council. In May, 2000â€”the
first and last case of its kindâ€”the Christian Institute unsuccessfully took
Glasgow City Council to court for funding an AIDS support charity which the
Institute alleged promoted homosexuality. Repeal. On 7 February 2000, the first
attempted legislation to repeal Section 28 was introduced by the Labour
Government as part of the Local Government Act 2000, but was defeated by a
House of Lords campaign led by Baroness Young. In the newly devolved Scottish
Parliament the repeal process was more successful. Various groups campaigned
against the repeal. The Scottish millionaire businessman Brian Souter privately
funded a postal ballot as part of his Keep the Clause campaign, which returned
an apparent 86% support for keeping the clause, from a response from slightly
less than one third of the 3.9Â million registered Scottish voters Despite
this, Section 28 (although, more accurately, it was Section 2A of the relevant
Scottish legislation) was repealed by MSPs as part of the Ethical Standards in
Public Life etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 on 21 June 2000 with a 99 to 17 majority
vote with only two abstentions. On 24 July 2000 the Local Government Act 2000
was sent back to the Lords with an amendment re-introducing repeal. Concessions
were made in the form of the new Learning and Skills Act 2000 which emphasised
family values and which was hoped would win over opponents. However, the repeal
was again defeated in the House of Lords. Despite these successive defeats in
the House of Lords of attempts to repeal Section 28 in England and Wales, the
Labour government passed legislation to repeal this section as part of the
Local Government Act 2003 by a vote of MPs. In a part of the legal process
(Standing Committee A) Edward Davey said "In a liberal democracy, the need to
protect minorities properly sometimes means that protection cannot be achieved
through the ballot box and that some things are not appropriate for a vote."
This passed the Lords, received Royal Assent on 18 September 2003, and the
repeal became effective on 18 November 2003. The Conservative-run Kent County
Council, however, decided to create their own version of Section 28 to keep the
effect of the now repealed law in their schools. This was replaced on 16
December 2004 with provisions stating that heterosexual marriage and family
relationships are the only firm foundations for society. The statement now
says: "We will ensure that sex education values family and marriage as the
foundation of a civilised society, and a firm basis for the nurturing of
children." Support. Section 28 was supported by religious groups such as the
Salvation Army, the Christian Institute, the African and Caribbean Evangelical
Association, Christian Action Research and Education, the Muslim Council of
Britain, and groups within the Catholic Church and the Church of England. The
Conservative Party, despite dissent within its ranks on the issue, whipped its
members in support of Section 28 in 2000, but in 2003, after further dissent
from within the party, allowed a free vote. In the House of Lords, the campaign
against the repeal of Section 28 was led by the late Baroness Janet Young.
Newspapers that strongly supported Section 28 included "The Daily Mail", "The
Sun" and "The Daily Telegraph". In Scotland the most visible supporters of
Section 28 were Brian Souter and the "Daily Record" newspaper. Opposition. Gay
rights advocates, such as Stonewall, OutRage!, "The Pink Paper" and the "Gay
Times" formed the major opposition to Section 28 and led the campaign for its
repeal. Prominent individuals who spoke out for the repeal of Section 28
included Sir Ian McKellen, Michael Cashman, Ivan Massow, Mo Mowlam, Simon
Callow, Annette Crosbie, Michael Grade, Jane Horrocks, Michael Mansfield QC,
Helen Mirren, Claire Rayner, Ned Sherrin and Alan Moore. A coalition of comic
book creators, including Moore, Frank Miller, Robert Crumb, Art Spiegelman,
Neil Gaiman, and many others, produced a magazine called "AARGH (Artists
Against Rampant Government Homophobia)" and raised at least Â£20,000 to
contribute to the fight against the legislation, according to Moore. Boy George
wrote a song opposed to Section 28, entitled "No Clause 28". The band
Chumbawamba recorded a single entitled "Smash Clause 28! Fight The Alton Bill!"
which was an attack on Clause/Section 28 and a benefit for a gay rights group;
it also featured 12 pages of hand printed notes relating to gay rights. The
legislation was also opposed by some religious groups and leaders, such as
Richard Harries, Bishop of Oxford. Newspapers that came out in opposition
included "The Guardian", "The Independent" and "The Daily Mirror". Political
parties that were opposed to Section 28 included the Labour Party, the Liberal
Democrats and the Green Party. In the House of Lords the campaign for repeal
was led by openly-gay peer Waheed Alli. Perhaps the most famous act of
opposition to Section 28 came when Shaun Woodward, a Conservative MP with a
transgender sister, defected from the Conservative Party and his seat and
joined the ruling Labour Party in opposition to the Conservatives' continued
support of Section 28. In retrospect. Some prominent MPs who supported the bill
when it was first introduced have since either expressed regret over their
support, changed their stance due to different circumstances which have evolved
over time, or have argued that the legislation is no longer necessary. In
February, 2006, Conservative Party Chairman Francis Maude told Pinknews.co.uk
that the policy, which he had voted for, was wrong and a mistake. In 2000,
David Cameron (at that time an unelected Conservative party member) repeatedly
attacked the Labour government's plans to abolish Section 28, publicly
criticising then-Prime Minister Tony Blair as being "anti-family" and accused
him of wanting the "promotion of homosexuality in schools". In 2003, once
Cameron had been elected as Conservative MP for Witney, he continued to support
Section 28. As the Labour government were determined to remove Section 28 from
law, Cameron voted in favour of a Conservative amendment that retained certain
aspects of the clause, which gay rights campaigners described as "Section 28 by
the back door". This was unsuccessful, and Section 28 was repealed by the
Labour government without concession (Cameron was absent for the vote on its
eventual repeal). However, in June 2009, Cameronâ€”then leader of the
Conservative Party whilst campaigning to be the next Prime Ministerâ€”formally
apologised for his party introducing the law, stating that it was a mistake and
had been offensive to gay people. He restated this belief in January 2010 and
proposed to alter the policy of the Conservative Party to reflect his belief
that equality should be taught in British schools though he has yet to further
this proposal since he became Prime Minister in May 2010. Model Funding
Agreement for academies and free schools. The stipulation that the benefits of
marriage be taught in academies and free schools was put forward by Michael
Gove in Clause 28 of the Model Funding Agreement. Although the clause does not
explicitly mention sexual orientation, same-sex marriage is not currently
possible in the UK, which prompted "The Daily Telegraph" (traditionally
supportive of the Conservative Party) to draw comparisons between the two
clauses.
