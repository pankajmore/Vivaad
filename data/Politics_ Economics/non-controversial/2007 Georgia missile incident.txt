2007 Georgia missile incident The 2007 Georgia missile incident refers to the
landing of a missile in the Georgian village of Tsitelubani in the Gori
district near the Georgian-Ossetian conflict zone, some north-west of Tbilisi,
the capital of Georgia, on 7 August 2007. Georgian officials said that two
Russian combat aircraft violated its airspace and fired a missile, which fell
on the edge of a village but did not explode. Russia denied this allegation and
said that Georgia may have fired the missile on its own territory as a way of
provoking tensions in the region. Several expert teams were sent to Georgia to
investigate the incident. While two international investigation teams confirmed
Georgia's claims, the Russian team dismissed them. The Organization for
Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) stated that it was "extremely
difficult to have a clear picture", given the conflicting nature of the
experts' findings. The organization decided not to launch its own probe into
the incident. The Portuguese ambassador to the OSCE has issued a statement on
behalf of the EU, which refrained from supporting either Georgian or Russian
version of the events. Background. The missile incident occurred amids rising
tensions between Georgia and Russia since the 2003 Rose Revolution, which
brought Mikhail Saakashvili, a pro-western president to power. Among others,
his wish for Georgia to join NATO and the EU, as well as seeking greater
economic and military ties with the West, irked Russia as it marked a loss of
Russian influence in the region. Since then, several crises, incidents and
accusations have succeeded each other: the 2004 Adjara crisis, the 2006 North
Ossetia sabotages, the 2006 Russian ban of Moldovan and Georgian wines, the
2006 Kodori crisis, the 2006 Georgian-Russian espionage controversy and the
March 2007 Georgia helicopter attack incident. Incident. Vano Merabishvili,
Georgiaâ€™s interior minister, said that two Sukhoi attack aircraft entered
Georgian airspace from Russia at 7.30Â pm on 7 August and fired at least one
air-to-surface missile at the village of Tsitelubani. The missile left a 16-
foot crater in a field but failed to detonate. Sappers later defused the
missile. Reactions and views. Georgia. Georgian experts have identified the
missile as a Soviet-designed Kh-58 ARM. The remains of the missile were
destroyed by the Georgian authorities before its identity could be confirmed by
the Joint Control Commission. Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili said the
incident was part of a pattern of Russian aggression against its neighbors and
urged European states to condemn Moscow. Georgia claimed to have radar evidence
proving that the invading aircraft flew in from Russia and said that the strike
had aimed, unsuccessfully, at destroying radar equipment recently installed
near the South Ossetian conflict zone. The Georgian experts suggested the pilot
did not fire but jettisoned the missile and fled after friendly forces of South
Ossetia mistakenly fired an anti-aircraft missile at his jet. Former President
of Georgia Eduard Shevardnadze, said that during his time in office, Russian
jets on a regular basis bombed Georgian forces during the wars in the 1990s
when Abkhazia and South Ossetia broke from central government control. "I won't
be revealing any great secrets if I say that that such violations of Georgia's
air space and bombings were common during my presidency. But Russian forces
never acknowledged any of this," Shevardnadze said. The Georgian opposition
politicians Salome Zourabichvili and Shalva Natelashvili suggested that the
Georgian authorities might have been behind the incident, intended as a
provocation. On 22 August, after the conclusions of the two international and
the Russian investigations (see below), Georgia's UN ambassador, Irakli
Alasania, accused Russia of attempting to "intimidate Georgia and assess
Georgian military readiness." He further added that Georgia had to "take an
absolutely resolute and non-negotiable stance in the face of efforts to use
military force to destabilize a democratic state, and to attempt to influence
its domestic and foreign policy". South Ossetia. South Ossetian President
Eduard Kokoity described the incident as "a provocation staged by the Georgian
side, aimed at discrediting Russia", claiming that another bomb fell in South
Ossetia. In his words, "a Georgian military plane crossed into South Ossetia on
Monday, performed manoeuvres above Ossetian villages and dropped two bombs." On
9 August 2007, South Ossetian President Eduard Kokoity announced that he
intends to request that Russia deploys air-defense systems in the republic, to
discourage any such future incidents. Russia. Russia also denied the Georgian
claim. Later that day, Russia's foreign ministry said that Georgian jets may
have fired the missile on their own territory as a way of provoking tensions in
the region and derailing a session of the Joint Control Commission on Georgian-
South Ossetian Conflict Resolution. Georgia immediately denounced the claim as
absurdity. Pavel Akulyonok, a Russian Air Force engineer working for the
Russian team investigating the incident, said that "the Georgian side has
forged facts". He said many parts of the missile which usually remain after an
impact could not be found. Other. The U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State
for European Affairs Matthew Bryza rejected the Russian allegations, advising
Moscow to tone down its rhetoric on Georgia. European Commission spokeswoman
Christiane Hohmann urged Georgia and Russia to show restraint and said it is
not possible to further comment on the incident until the full facts are known.
She added a team from the OSCE is looking into the affair. The OSCE has also
appealed for both sides to show restraint. Adrian Blomfield reported in "The
Daily Telegraph" that some commentators suggested that a group of Kremlin
hardliners were intent on provoking a military confrontation to provide an
excuse to change the Russian constitution and allow Russian president Vladimir
Putin to stay in power. Alexei Malashenko, an expert on the Caucasus at the
Moscow Carnegie Centre, said it was possible that this faction had ordered the
firing of a dummy missile in a bid to fuel the crisis. But he said it was more
likely that the missile attack could have been carried out by local Russian
army units without the knowledge of the Russian government. Stratfor, a private
intelligence agency based in the United States, speculates that "considering
regional developments in the past few weeks, this "bomb" was far more likely a
Georgian ploy than a Russian one. (And it is even more likely that it was
accidentally dropped by an under-loved and under-maintained Georgian aircraft
rather than deliberately targeted.)". Aftermath. OSCE report. According to the
Georgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Organization for Security and Co-
operation in Europe (OSCE) spokeswoman in Vienna, the OSCE mission reported
"one aircraft flying from north-east" though the report has not yet been
publicly released. The spokeswoman stressed that it was "an internal report
that does not represent the position of the OSCE". The Georgian state minister
Davit Bakradze added that "there is no other country than Russia to the north-
east." On 17 August 2007, OSCE Chairman-in-Office, Spanish Foreign Minister
Miguel Angel Moratinos, appointed Croatian diplomat and ex-minister Miomir
Å½uÅ¾ul, "to be his personal representative in a mission to Georgia on (a)
missile incident that took place on 6 August," alleged to be a Russian missile
strike on Georgian territory. Å½uÅ¾ul will reportedly travel to Georgia and the
Russian Federation early on the week of 20 August. He will reportedly be joined
by the Charge dÂ´Affaires of the Spanish Permanent Mission to the OSCE, Arturo
Perez Martinez. On 30 August, the OSCE's chairman-in-office, Spanish Foreign
Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos, met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei
Lavrov in Moscow. The ministers discussed among others the missile incident and
Moratinos outlined the contents of the report prepared by his special envoy
Å½uÅ¾ul on meetings he had the week before in Moscow and Tbilisi. The report,
which is not yet publicly available, will be presented by Å½uÅ¾ul at the OSCE
Permanent Council meeting in Vienna on 6 September. An OSCE spokesman said that
"the key point here is that it's not the OSCE's role to pass judgment, or point
the finger. It's to listen to all sides, and to recommend and seek ways to
avoid similar incidents and tensions in the future. So this is not about trying
to establish who was responsible, or what exactly happened, but to look to the
future to try to find ways to ensure that this kind of thing does not happen
again." On 6 September 2007, a months after the incident, a closed-door OSCE
Council session was held. Julie Finley, the US ambassador to the OSCE,
dismissed the report of the Russian experts and called for the OSCE to launch
its own investigation. This motion was not supported by Å½uÅ¾ul; there will be
no OSCE probe into the incident. Instead, the organization will focus on
preventing similar incidents in the future, promptly intervening in the event
of a crisis. UN Security Council. The Georgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs
tried to secure the holding of a UN Security Council session to discuss the
incident and to encourage the international involvement into the investigation
of the attack. Former Georgian president Shevardnadze dismissed efforts to
involve the United Nations, as Russia would use its veto as a permanent member
of the Security Council to thwart any real investigation or criticism. On 16
August, the United States, which backed Georgia's call for a special session,
attempted to have the Security Council issue a statement on the alleged
incident. Russia, however, blocked the move, calling it "premature."
International investigation. On 15 August, the group of defense specialists
from the United States, Sweden, Latvia, and Lithuania, involved in the
international investigation at Georgia's request, released their findings in
Tbilisi. The group confirmed that the plane flew from Russia into Georgian
airspace and back three times and described the missile as a Russian-designed
KH-58, which is intended to take out radar systems. The team added that
Georgian Air Force "does not possess aircraft equipped with or able to launch"
that missile. A team of Russian investigators also arrived in Georgia on 16
August to conduct its own probe. Speaking at a news conference in Tbilisi,
Russian ambassador Valery Kenyaikin said on 16 August that Moscow did not find
the evidence of the international team convincing. He also said the Russian
team presented evidence that refuted the team's findings, commenting that: "The
documents handed to the Georgian side show â€“ and I hope prove â€“ the absence
of any information or elements information testifying to the violation of
Georgian airspace by Russia." A Russian Air Force official also claimed that
Georgian authorities presented the Russian investigators with parts of several
different missiles, some of which had traces of rust on them. An envoy
appointed by the OSCE to investigate the incident met Georgian officials in
Tbilisi, and traveled to Moscow. A group of experts from Britain, Poland, and
Estonia corroborated the results of the previous international investigation
that a military jet illegally entered its airspace from Russia and dropped or
jettisoned a missile before flying back to Russia.
