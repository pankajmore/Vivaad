Affair An affair is a sexual relationship or a romantic friendship or
passionate attachment between two people. The term "affair" could also refer to
a political scandal. The common theme between the two meanings is that a
personal affair might also arouse a scandal if discovered, especially when it
is extramarital. Romantic affair. A romantic affair, also called an affair of
the heart, may refer to sexual liaisons among unwed parties, or to various
forms of nonmonogamy. Unlike a casual relationship, which is a physical and
emotional relationship between two people who may have sex without expecting a
more formal romantic relationship, an affair is by its nature romantic. Affair
may also describe part of an agreement within an open marriage or open
relationship, such as swinging, dating, or polyamory, in which some forms of
sex with one's non-primary partner(s) are permitted and other forms are not.
Participants in open relationships, including unmarried couples and polyamorous
families, may consider sanctioned affairs the norm, but when a non-sanctioned
affair occurs, it is described as infidelity and may be experienced as
adultery, or a betrayal both of trust and integrity, even though to most people
it would not be considered "illicit". When a romantic affair lacks both overt
and covert sexual behaviour and yet exhibits intense or enduring emotional
intimacy it may be referred to as an emotional affair, platonic love, or a
romantic friendship. Extramarital affair. Extramarital affairs are
relationships outside of marriage where an illicit romantic or sexual
relationship or a romantic friendship or passionate attachment occurs. An
extramarital affair that continues in one form or another for years, even as
one of the partners to that affair passes through marriage, divorce and
remarriage, could be considered the primary relationship and the marriages
secondary to it. This may be serial polygamy or other forms of nonmonogamy. The
ability to pursue serial and clandestine extramarital affairs whilst
safeguarding the secrets and conflict of interest inherent in the practice,
requires skill in deception and duplicitous negotiation. Even to hide one
affair requires a degree of skill or malicious gaslighting. All these behaviors
are more usually called lying. Deception can be defined as the "covert
manipulation of perception to alter thoughts, feeling, or beliefs". The
presence of deception may indicate the degree to which the deceiver has
breached fundamental conditions of fidelity, of reciprocal vulnerability and of
transparency. Sometimes these are explicit or assumed pre-conditions of a
committed intimate relationships. Individuals having affairs with married men
or women can be prosecuted for adultery in some jurisdictions and can be sued
by the jilted spouses in others, or named as 'co-respondent' in divorce
proceedings. As of 2009, eight U.S.Â states permitted such alienation of
affections lawsuits. Online affair. The appearance of computer-mediated
communication introduces a new type of communication and consequently a new
type of "affair". There are various kinds of computer-mediated communication
that differ in some significant aspects: one-to-one or group communication
formats, interrelating with anonymous or identified people, and communicating
in synchronous or asynchronous formats. Online affairs combine features of
close and remote relationships. Ben Ze'ef argues that an online affair is a
unique kind of affairâ€”termed "detached attachment", or just
"detachment"â€”that includes opposing features whose presence in a face-to-face
affair would be paradoxical. Like direct, face-to-face affairs, online affairs
can be spontaneous and casual and show intensive personal involvement. However,
online affairs can also be more of a planned discourse than spontaneous talk;
like written letters, online messages can be stored and thus have permanent
presence, which is absent from face-to-face affairs. People participating in
online affairs may be strangers to each other in the sense that they have never
actually met each other. However, they are also close to each other since they
share intimate information. In online affairs, people try to enjoy the benefits
of both close and remote affairs, while avoiding their flaws. People enjoy the
highly valued products of close affairs while paying the low cost of remote
affairs. As one woman wrote: 'He constantly told me that he can not provide me
with what I would want and I would always respond with: "I'm not asking
anything from you, but simply enjoy your company".
