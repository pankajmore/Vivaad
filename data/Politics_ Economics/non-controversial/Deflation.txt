Deflation In economics, deflation is a decrease in the general price level of
goods and services. Deflation occurs when the inflation rate falls below 0% (a
negative inflation rate). This should not be confused with disinflation, a
slow-down in the inflation rate (i.e. when inflation declines to lower levels).
Inflation reduces the real value of money over time; conversely, deflation
increases the real value of money â€“ the currency of a national or regional
economy. This allows one to buy more goods with the same amount of money over
time. Economists generally believe that deflation is a problem in a modern
economy because they believe it may lead to a deflationary spiral. Historically
not all episodes of deflation correspond with periods of poor economic growth.
Deflation occurred in the U.S. during most the 19th century (the most important
exception was during the Civil War). This deflation was caused by technological
progress that created significant economic growth. Causes and corresponding
types. In the IS/LM model (Investment and Saving equilibrium/ Liquidity
Preference and Money Supply equilibrium model), deflation is caused by a shift
in the supply-and-demand curve for goods and services, particularly a fall in
the aggregate level of demand. That is, there is a fall in how much the whole
economy is willing to buy, and the going price for goods. Because the price of
goods is falling, consumers have an incentive to delay purchases and
consumption until prices fall further, which in turn reduces overall economic
activity. Since this idles the productive capacity, investment also falls,
leading to further reductions in aggregate demand. This is the deflationary
spiral. An answer to falling aggregate demand is stimulus, either from the
central bank, by expanding the money supply, or by the fiscal authority to
increase demand, and to borrow at interest rates which are below those
available to private entities. In more recent economic thinking, deflation is
related to risk: where the risk-adjusted return on assets drops to negative,
investors and buyers will hoard currency rather than invest it, even in the
most solid of securities. This can produce a liquidity trap. A central bank
cannot, normally, charge negative interest for money, and even charging zero
interest often produces less stimulative effect than slightly higher rates of
interest. In a closed economy, this is because charging zero interest also
means having zero return on government securities, or even negative return on
short maturities. In an open economy it creates a carry trade, and devalues the
currency. A devalued currency produces higher prices for imports without
necessarily stimulating exports to a like degree. In monetarist theory,
deflation must be associated with either a reduction in the money supply, a
reduction in the velocity of money or an increase in the number of
transactions. But any of these may occur separately without deflation. It may
be attributed to a dramatic contraction of the money supply, or to adherence to
a gold standard or other external monetary base requirement. However, deflation
is the natural condition of hard currency economies when the supply of money is
not increased as much as positive population growth and economic growth. When
this happens, the available amount of hard currency per person falls, in effect
making money more scarce; and consequently, the purchasing power of each unit
of currency increases. Deflation occurs when improvements in production
efficiency lower the overall price of goods. Competition in the marketplace
often prompts those producers to apply at least some portion of these cost
savings into reducing the asking price for their goods. When this happens,
consumers pay less for those goods; and consequently deflation has occurred,
since purchasing power has increased. Rising productivity and reduced
transportation cost created structural deflation during the acceleration
productivity era of from 1870â€“1900, but there was mild inflation for about a
decade before the establishment of the Federal Reserve in 1913. There was
inflation during World War I, but deflation returned again after that war and
during the 1930s depression. Most nations abandoned the gold standard in the
1930s. There is less reason to expect deflation, aside from the collapse of
speculative asset classes, under a fiat monetary system with low productivity
growth. In mainstream economics, deflation may be caused by a combination of
the supply and demand for goods and the supply and demand for money,
specifically the supply of money going down and the supply of goods going up.
Historic episodes of deflation have often been associated with the supply of
goods going up (due to increased productivity) without an increase in the
supply of money, or (as with the Great Depression and possibly Japan in the
early 1990s) the demand for goods going down combined with a decrease in the
money supply. Studies of the Great Depression by Ben Bernanke have indicated
that, in response to decreased demand, the Federal Reserve of the time
decreased the money supply, hence contributing to deflation. Debt deflation.
Debt deflation is a complicated phenomenon associated with the end of long-term
credit cycles. It was proposed as a theory by Irving Fisher (1933) to explain
the deflation of the Great Depression. Money supply side deflation. From a
monetarist perspective, deflation is caused primarily by a reduction in the
velocity of money and/or the amount of money supply per person. A historical
analysis of money velocity and monetary base shows an inverse correlation: for
a given percentage decrease in the monetary base the result is nearly equal
percentage increase in money velocity. This is to be expected because monetary
base (MB), velocity of base money (VB), price level (P) and real output (Y) are
related by definition: MB*VBÂ =Â P*Y. However, it is important to note that the
monetary base is a much narrower definition of money than M2 money supply.
Additionally, the velocity of the monetary base is interest rate sensitive, the
highest velocity being at the highest interest rates. In the early history of
the United States there was no national currency and an insufficient supply of
coinage. Banknotes were the majority of the money in circulation. During
financial crises many banks failed and their notes became worthless. Also,
banknotes were discounted relative to gold and silver, the discount depending
on the financial strength of the bank. In recent years changes in the money
supply have historically taken a long time to show up in the price level, with
a rule of thumb lag of at least 18 months. More recently Alan Greenspan cited
the time lag as taking between 12 and 13 quarters. Bonds, equities and
commodities have been suggested as reservoirs for buffering changes in money
supply. Credit deflation. In modern credit-based economies, deflation may be
caused by the central bank "initiating" higher interest rates (i.e., to
'control' inflation), thereby possibly popping an asset bubble. In a credit-
based economy, a fall in money supply leads to markedly less lending, with a
further sharp fall in money supply, and a consequent sharp fall-off in demand
for goods. The fall in demand causes a fall in prices as a supply glut
develops. This becomes a deflationary spiral when prices fall below the costs
of financing production. Businesses, unable to make enough profit no matter how
low they set prices, are then liquidated. Banks get assets which have fallen
dramatically in value since their mortgage loan was made, and if they sell
those assets, they further glut supply, which only exacerbates the situation.
To slow or halt the deflationary spiral, banks will often withhold collecting
on non-performing loans (as in Japan, and most recently America and Spain).
This is often no more than a stop-gap measure, because they must then restrict
credit, since they do not have money to lend, which further reduces demand, and
so on. Historical examples of credit deflation. In the early economic history
of the United States, cycles of inflation and deflation correlated with capital
flows between regions, with money being loaned from the financial center in the
Northeast to the commodity producing regions of the -West and South. In a
procyclical manner, prices of commodities rose when capital was flowing in,
that is, when banks were willing to lend, and fell in the depression years of
1818 and 1839 when banks called in loans. Also, there was no national currency
at the time and there was a scarcity of coins. Most money circulated as
banknotes, which typically sold at a discount according to distance from the
issuing bank and the bank's perceived financial strength. When banks failed
their notes were redeemed for bank reserves, which often did not result in
payment at par value, and sometimes the notes became worthless. Notes of weak
surviving banks traded at steep discounts. During the Great Depression, people
who owed money to a bank whose deposits had been frozen would sometimes buy
bank books (deposits of other people at the bank) at a discount and use them to
pay off their debt at par value. A financial crisis in England in 1818 caused
banks to call in loans and curtail new lending, draining specie out of the U.S.
The Bank of the United States also reduced its lending. Prices for cotton and
tobacco fell. The price of agricultural commodities also were pressured by a
return of normal harvests following 1816, the "year without a summer", that
caused large scale famine and high agricultural prices. There were several
causes of the deflation of the severe depression of 1839-43, which included an
oversupply of agricultural commodities (importantly cotton) as new cropland
came into production following large federal land sales a few years earlier,
banks requiring payment in gold or silver, the failure of several banks,
default by several states on their bonds and British banks cutting back on
specie flow to the U.S. This cycle has been traced out on the broad scale
during the Great Depression. Partly because of overcapacity and market
saturation and partly as a result of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, international
trade contracted sharply, severely reducing demand for goods, thereby idling a
great deal of capacity, and setting off a string of bank failures. A similar
situation in Japan, beginning with the stock and real estate market collapse in
the early 1990s, was arrested by the Japanese government preventing the
collapse of most banks and taking over direct control of several in the worst
condition. Scarcity of official money. The United States had no national paper
money until 1862 (greenbacks used to fund the Civil War), but these notes were
discounted to gold until 1877. There was also a shortage of U.S. minted coins.
Foreign coins, such as Mexican silver, were commonly used. At times banknotes
were as much as 80% of currency in circulation before the Civil War. In the
financial crises of 1818-19 and 1837â€“41, many banks failed, leaving their
money to be redeemed below par value from reserves. Sometimes the notes became
worthless, and the notes of weak surviving banks were heavily discounted. The
Jackson administration opened branch mints, which over time increased the
supply of coins. Following the 1848 discovery of gold in California, enough
gold came to market to devalue gold relative to silver. To equalize the value
of the two metals in coinage, the U.S. mint slightly reduced the silver content
of new coinage in 1853. When structural deflation appeared in the years
following 1870, a common explanation given by various government inquiry
committees was a scarcity of gold and silver, although they usually mentioned
the changes in industry and trade we now call productivity. However, David A.
Wells (1890) notes that the U. S. money supply during the period 1879-1889
actually rose 60%, the increase being in gold and silver, which rose against
the percentage of national bank and legal tender notes. Furthermore, Wells
argued that the deflation only lowered the cost of goods that benefited from
recent improved methods of manufacturing and transportation. Goods produced by
craftsmen did not decrease in price, nor did many services, and the cost of
labor actually increased. Also, deflation did not occur in countries that did
not have modern manufacturing, transportation and communications. By the end of
the 19th century, the deflation ended and turned to mild inflation. William
Stanley Jevons predicted rising gold supply would cause inflation decades
before it actually did. Irving Fisher blamed the world wide inflation of the
pre WW I years on rising gold supply. In economies with an unstable currency,
barter and other alternate currency arrangements such as dollarization are
common, and therefore when the 'official' money becomes scarce (or unusually
unreliable), commerce can still continue (e.g., most recently in Zimbabwe).
Since in such economies the central government is often unable, even if it were
willing, to adequately control the internal economy, there is no pressing need
for individuals to acquire official currency except to pay for imported goods.
In effect, barter acts as a protective tariff in such economies, encouraging
local consumption of local production. It also acts as a spur to mining and
exploration, because one easy way to make money in such an economy is to dig it
out of the ground. Effects. Deflation was present during most economic
depressions in US history Deflation is generally regarded negatively, as it
causes a transfer of wealth from borrowers and holders of illiquid assets, to
the benefit of savers and of holders of liquid assets and currency, and because
confused pricing signals cause malinvestment, in the form of under-investment.
In this sense it is the opposite of the more usual scenario of inflation, whose
effect is to tax currency holders and lenders (savers) and use the proceeds to
subsidize borrowers, including governments, and to cause malinvestment as
overinvestment. Thus inflation encourages short term consumption and can
similarly over-stimulate investment in projects that may not be worthwhile in
real terms (for example the housing or dot.com bubbles), while deflation
retards investment even when there is a real-world demand not being met. In
modern economies, deflation is usually caused by a drop in aggregate demand,
and is associated with economic depression, as occurred in the Great Depression
and the Long Depression. While an increase in the purchasing power of one's
money benefits some, it amplifies the sting of debt for others: after a period
of deflation, the payments to service a debt represent a larger amount of
purchasing power than they did when the debt was first incurred. Consequently,
deflation can be thought of as an effective increase in a loan's interest rate.
If, as during the Great Depression in the United States, deflation averages 10%
per year, even an interest-free loan is unattractive as it must be repaid with
money worth 10% more each year. Under normal conditions, the Fed and most other
central banks implement policy by setting a target for a short-term interest
rate â€” the overnight federal funds rate in the US â€” and enforcing that
target by buying and selling securities in open capital markets. When the
short-term interest rate hits zero, the central bank can no longer ease policy
by lowering its usual interest-rate target. With interest rates near zero, debt
relief becomes an increasingly important tool in managing deflation. Some
believe that, in the absence of large amounts of debt, deflation would be a
welcome effect because the lowering of prices increases purchasing power. Since
deflationary periods disfavor debtors (including most farmers), they are often
periods of rising populist backlash. For example, in the late 19th century,
populists in the US wanted debt relief or to move off the new gold standard,
and onto: a silver standard (the supply of silver was increasing relatively
faster than the supply of gold making silver less deflationary than gold),
bimetal standard, or paper money like the recently-ended Greenbacks.
Deflationary spiral. A "deflationary spiral" is a situation where decreases in
price lead to lower production, which in turn leads to lower wages and demand,
which leads to further decreases in price. Since reductions in general price
level are called deflation, a deflationary spiral is when reductions in price
lead to a vicious circle, where a problem exacerbates its own cause. The Great
Depression was regarded by some as a deflationary spiral. A deflationary spiral
is the modern macroeconomic version of the general glut controversy of the 19th
century. Another related idea is Irving Fisher's theory that excess debt can
cause a continuing deflation. Whether deflationary spirals can actually occur
is controversial, with its possibility being disputed by freshwater economists
(including the Chicago school of economics) and Austrian School economists.
Counteracting deflation. During severe deflation, targeting an interest rate
(the usual method of determining how much money to create) may be ineffective,
because even lowering the short-term interest rate to zero may result in a real
interest rate which is too high to attract credit-worthy borrowers. Thus the
central bank must directly set a target for the quantity of money (called
"quantitative easing") and may use extraordinary methods to increase the supply
of money, e.g. purchasing financial assets of a type not usually used by the
central bank as reserves (such as mortgage backed securities). Before he was
Chairman of the United States Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke claimed in 2002,
"...sufficient injections of money will ultimately always reverse a deflation",
although Japan's deflationary spiral was not broken by this very sort of
quantitative easing. Until the 1930s, it was commonly believed by economists
that deflation would cure itself. As prices decreased, demand would naturally
increase and the economic system would correct itself without outside
intervention. This view was challenged in the 1930s during the Great
Depression. Keynesian economists argued that the economic system was not self-
correcting with respect to deflation and that governments and central banks had
to take active measures to boost demand through tax cuts or increases in
government spending. Reserve requirements from the central bank were high
compared to recent times. So were it not for redemption of currency for gold
(in accordance with the gold standard), the central bank could have effectively
increased money supply by simply reducing the reserve requirements and through
open market operations (e.g., buying treasury bonds for cash) to offset the
reduction of money supply in the private sectors due to the collapse of credit
(credit is a form of money). With the rise of monetarist ideas, the focus in
fighting deflation was put on expanding demand by lowering interest rates
(i.e., reducing the "cost" of money). This view has received a setback in light
of the failure of accommodative policies in both Japan and the US to spur
demand after stock market shocks in the early 1990s and in 2000â€“2002,
respectively. Austrian economists worry about the inflationary impact of
monetary policies on asset prices. Sustained low real rates can cause higher
asset prices and excessive debt accumulation. Therefore, lowering rates may
prove to be only a temporary palliative, aggravating an eventual debt deflation
crisis. With interest rates near zero, debt relief becomes an increasingly
important tool in managing deflation. Special borrowing arrangements. When the
central bank has lowered nominal interest rates to zero, it can no longer
further stimulate demand by lowering interest rates. This is the famous
liquidity trap. When deflation takes hold, it requires "special arrangements"
to lend money at a zero nominal rate of interest (which could still be a very
high "real" rate of interest, due to the "negative" inflation rate) in order to
artificially increase the money supply. Historical examples. In Hong Kong.
Following the Asian financial crisis in late 1997, Hong Kong experienced a long
period of deflation which did not end until the 4th quarter of 2004 [http://
www.info.gov.hk/censtatd/eng/hkstat/fas/cpi/cpi_adjust_index.html]. Many East
Asian currencies devalued following the crisis. The Hong Kong dollar however,
was pegged to the US Dollar, leading to an adjustment instead by a deflation of
consumer prices. The situation was worsened by the increasingly cheap exports
from Mainland China, and weak consumer confidence in Hong Kong. This deflation
was accompanied by an economic slump that was more severe and prolonged than
those of the surrounding countries that devalued their currencies in the wake
of the Asian financial crisis. In Ireland. In February 2009, Ireland's Central
Statistics Office announced that during January 2009, the country experienced
deflation, with prices falling by 0.1% from the same time in 2008. This is the
first time deflation has hit the Irish economy since 1960. Overall consumer
prices decreased by 1.7% in the month. Brian Lenihan, Ireland's Minister for
Finance, mentioned deflation in an interview with RTÃ‰ Radio. According to
RTÃ‰'s account, "Minister for Finance Brian Lenihan has said that deflation
must be taken into account when Budget cuts in child benefit, public sector pay
and professional fees are being considered. Mr Lenihan said month-on-month
there has been a 6.6% decline in the cost of living this year." This interview
is notable in that the deflation referred to is not discernibly regarded
negatively by the Minister in the interview. The Minister mentions the
deflation as an item of data helpful to the arguments for a cut in certain
benefits. The alleged economic harm caused by deflation is not alluded to or
mentioned by this member of government. This is a notable example of deflation
in the modern era being discussed by a senior financial Minister without any
mention of how it might be avoided, or whether it should be. In Japan.
Deflation started in the early 1990s. The Bank of Japan and the government
tried to eliminate it by reducing interest rates and 'quantitative easing', but
did not create a sustained increase in broad money and deflation persisted. In
July 2006, the zero-rate policy was ended. In November 2009 Japan has returned
to deflation, according to the Wall Street Journal. Bloomberg L.P. reports that
consumer prices fell in October 2009 by a near-record 2.2%. In the United
States. Major deflations in the US. There have been four significant periods of
deflation in the United States. The first and most severe was during the
depression from 1818-21 when prices of agricultural commodities declined by
almost 50%. A credit contraction caused by a financial crisis in England
drained specie out of the U.S. The Bank of the United States also contracted
its lending. The price of agricultural commodities fell by almost 50% from the
high in 1815 to the low in 1821, and did not recover until the late 1930s,
although to a significantly lower price level. Most damaging was the price of
cotton, the U.S.'s main export. Food crop prices, which had been high because
of the famine of 1816 that was caused by the year without a summer, fell after
the return of normal harvests in 1818. Improved transportation, mainly from
turnpikes, and to a minor extent the introduction of steamboats, significantly
lowered transportation costs. The second was the depression of the late 1830s
to 1843, following the Panic of 1837, when the currency in the United States
contracted by about 33%, a contraction which is only matched by the Great
Depression. (See: Historical examples of credit deflation) This "deflation"
satisfies both definitions, that of a decrease in prices and a decrease in the
available quantity of money. Despite the deflation and depression, GDP rose 16%
from 1839-43. The third was after the Civil War, sometimes called The Great
Deflation. It was possibly spurred by return to a gold standard, retiring paper
money printed during the Civil War. http://www.grantspub.com/articles/
inflation/ The fourth was between 1930â€“1933 when the rate of deflation was
approximately 10 percent/year, part of the United States' slide into the Great
Depression, where banks failed and unemployment peaked at 25%. The deflation of
the Great Depression occurred partly because there was an enormous contraction
of credit (money), bankruptcies creating an environment where cash was in
frantic demand, and when the Federal Reserve was supposed to accommodate that
demand, it instead contracted the money supply by 30% in enforcement of its new
real bills doctrine, so banks toppled one-by-one (because they were unable to
meet the sudden demand for cashâ€” see Fractional-reserve banking). From the
standpoint of the Fisher equation (see above), there was a concomitant drop
both in money supply (credit) and the velocity of money which was so profound
that price deflation took hold despite the increases in money supply spurred by
the Federal Reserve. Minor deflations in the US. Throughout the history of the
United States, inflation has approached zero and dipped below for short periods
of time (negative inflation is deflation). This was quite common in the 19th
century, and in the 20th century until the permanent abandonment of the gold
standard for the Bretton Woods System in 1948. There has only been one period
of deflation since, in 2008-9. Some economists believe the United States may be
currently experiencing deflation as part of the Financial crisis of
2007â€“2010; compare the theory of debt-deflation. Year-on-year, consumer
prices dropped for six months in a row to end-August 2009, largely due to a
steep decline in energy prices. Consumer prices dropped 1 percent in October,
2008. This was the largest one-month fall in prices in the US since at least
1947. That record was again broken in November, 2008 with a 1.7% decline. In
response, the Federal Reserve decided to continue cutting interest rates, down
to a near-zero range as of December 16, 2008. In late 2008 and early 2009, some
economists feared the US could enter a deflationary spiral. Economist Nouriel
Roubini predicted that the United States would enter a deflationary recession,
and coined the term "stag-deflation" to describe it. It is the opposite of
stagflation, which was the main fear during the spring and summer of 2008. The
United States then began experiencing measurable deflation, steadily decreasing
from the first measured deflation of -0.38% in March, to July's deflation rate
of -2.10%. On the wage front, in October 2009 the state of Colorado announced
that its state minimum wage, which is indexed to inflation, is set to be cut,
which would be the first time a state has cut its minimum wage since 1938. In
the United Kingdom. During World War I the British pound sterling was removed
from the gold standard. The motivation for this policy change was to finance
World War I; one of the results was inflation, and a rise in the gold price,
along with the corresponding drop in international exchange rates for the
pound. When the pound was returned to the gold standard after the war it was
done on the basis of the pre-war gold price, which, since it was higher than
equivalent price in gold, required prices to fall to realign with the higher
target value of the pound. The UK experienced deflation of approx 10% in 1921,
14% in 1922, and 3 to 5% in the early 1930s.
