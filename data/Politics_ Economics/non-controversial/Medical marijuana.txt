Medical cannabis Medical cannabis refers to the parts of the herb cannabis used
as a physician-recommended form of medicine or herbal therapy, or to synthetic
forms of specific cannabinoids such as THC as a physician-recommended form of
medicine. The "Cannabis" plant has a long history of use as medicine, with
historical evidence dating back to 2737 BCE. Cannabis is one of the 50
"fundamental" herbs of traditional Chinese medicine, and is prescribed for a
broad range of indications. Use. Medical cannabis is illegal in most countries.
A number of governments, including the U.S. Federal Government, allow treatment
with one or more specific low doses of synthetic cannabinoids for one or more
disorders. Supporters of medical cannabis argue that cannabis does have several
well-documented beneficial effects. Among these are: the amelioration of nausea
and vomiting, stimulation of hunger in chemotherapy and AIDS patients, lowered
intraocular eye pressure (shown to be effective for treating glaucoma), as well
as gastrointestinal illness. Its effectiveness as an analgesic has been
suggested‚Äîand disputed‚Äîas well. There are several methods for
administration of dosage, including vaporizing or smoking dried buds, drinking,
or eating extracts, and taking capsules. The comparable efficiency of these
methods was the subject of an investigative study conducted by the National
Institutes of Health. Synthetic cannabinoids are available as prescription
drugs in some countries. Examples are Marinol (The United States and Canada)
and Cesamet (Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States). While
utilizing cannabis for recreational purposes is illegal in many parts of the
world, many countries are beginning to entertain varying levels of
decriminalization for medical usage (the medical marijuana movement), including
Canada, Austria, Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Czech Republic, Spain,
Israel, Italy, Finland, and Portugal. In the United States, federal law outlaws
all use of herb parts from Cannabis, while some states have approved use of
herb parts from Cannabis as medical cannabis in conflict with federal law. The
United States Supreme Court has ruled in "United States v. Oakland Cannabis
Buyers' Coop" and "Gonzales v. Raich" that the federal government has a right
to regulate and criminalize cannabis, even for medical purposes. A person can
therefore be prosecuted for a cannabis-related crime even if it is medical
cannabis that is legal according to the laws of this state. Clinical
applications. A 2002 review of medical literature by Franjo Grotenhermen states
that medical cannabis has established effects in the treatment of nausea,
vomiting, premenstrual syndrome, unintentional weight loss, insomnia, and lack
of appetite. Other "relatively well-confirmed" effects were in the treatment of
"spasticity, painful conditions, especially neurogenic pain, movement
disorders, asthma, glaucoma". Preliminary findings indicate that cannabis-based
drugs could prove useful in treating adrenal disease, inflammatory bowel
disease, migraines, fibromyalgia, and related conditions. Medical cannabis has
also been found to relieve certain symptoms of multiple sclerosis and spinal
cord injuries by exhibiting antispasmodic and muscle-relaxant properties as
well as stimulating appetite. Other studies state that cannabis or cannabinoids
may be useful in treating alcohol abuse, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,
collagen-induced arthritis, asthma, atherosclerosis, bipolar disorder,
colorectal cancer, HIV-Associated Sensory Neuropathy, depression, dystonia,
epilepsy, digestive diseases, gliomas, hepatitis C, Huntington's disease,
leukemia, skin tumors, methicillin-resistant "Staphylococcus aureus" (MRSA),
Parkinson's disease, pruritus, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), psoriasis,
sickle-cell disease, sleep apnea, and anorexia nervosa. Controlled research on
treating Tourette syndrome with a synthetic version of tetrahydrocannabinol,
(brand name Marinol) (the main psychoactive chemical found in cannabis), showed
the patients taking Marinol had a beneficial response without serious adverse
effects; other studies have shown that cannabis "has no effects on tics and
increases the individuals inner tension". Case reports found that cannabis
helped reduce tics, but validation of these results requires longer, controlled
studies on larger samples. A study done by Craig Reinarman surveyed among why
people in California used cannabis and it found many reasons why people had
used cannabis. It was used to relieve pain, muscle spasms, headaches, anxiety,
nausea, vomiting, depression, cramps, panic attacks, diarrhea, and itching.
Others used cannabis to improve sleep, relaxation, appetite, concentration or
focus, and energy. Some patients used it to prevent medication side effects,
anger, involuntary movements, and seizures, while others used it as a
substitute for other prescription medications and alcohol. Recent studies.
Safety of cannabis. Cannabis smoke contains thousands of organic and inorganic
chemical compounds. This tar is chemically similar to that found in cigarette
smoke and includes many of the same carcinogens. Deaths attributed directly to
cannabis usage are infrequent but have been documented. Cannabis related deaths
are more widespread. [http://www.samhsa.gov/data/DAWN/files/ME2003/
ME03FullReport.pdf] From January 1997 to June 2005, the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) reported zero deaths caused by the primary use of
cannabis. In contrast, common FDA-approved drugs which are often prescribed in
lieu of cannabis (such as anti-emetics and anti-psychotics), were the primary
cause of 10,008 deaths. The cannabinoid THC has an extremely low toxicity and
the amount that can enter the body through the consumption of cannabis plants
poses no threat of death. Cannabis smoke contains substances that can damage
DNA and increase the risk of cancer just like tobacco smoke, though no
definitive link between cannabis and cancer has been found. Cancer causing
chemicals in cannabis smoke have been found in amounts 50% higher than those
found in tobacco smoke. According to the British Lung Foundation, smoking three
to four joints (cannabis cigarettes) a day has been found to be associated with
the same degree of damage to tissue in the airways of the lung as 20 or more
tobacco cigarettes a day. The Journal of the American Medical Association
released findings from a 20-year study that bolstered evidence that cannabis
doesn't do the kind of damage tobacco does. Analysis of over 5,000 smokers
showed that cannabis did not appear to harm lung function, although cigarettes
did. Cigarette smokers' scores worsened steadily over the course of the study.
Participants who smoked up to 1 joint daily for 7 years, or 1 joint weekly for
20 years, were not linked with worse scores. Dr Donald Tashkin suggested the
reason for this might be that cannabis helps fight inflammation and may
counteract the effects of irritating chemicals in the drug. The study
concluded: "Occasional and low cumulative marijuana use was not associated with
adverse effects on pulmonary function". Cannabis usage has been shown to
negatively affect the ability to drive safely. The British Medical Journal
recently indicated that "Drivers who consume cannabis within three hours of
driving are nearly twice as likely to cause a vehicle collision as those who
are not under the influence of drugs or alcohol" Glaucoma. In glaucoma,
cannabis and THC have been shown to reduce intra-ocular pressure (IOP) by an
average of 24% in people with normal IOP who have visual-field changes. In
studies of healthy adults and glaucoma patients, IOP was reduced by an average
of 25% after smoking a cannabis "cigarette" that contained approximately 2%
THC‚Äîa reduction as good as that observed with most other medications
available today, according to a review by the Institute of Medicine. In a
separate study, the use of cannabis and glaucoma was tested and found that the
duration of smoked or ingested cannabis or other cannabinoids is very short,
averaging 3 to 3.5 hours. Their results showed that for cannabis to be a viable
therapy, the patient would have to take in cannabis in some form every 3 hours.
They said that for ideal glaucoma treatment it would take two times a day at
most for compliance purposes from patients. Spasticity in multiple sclerosis. A
review of six randomized controlled trials of a combination of THC and CBD
extracts for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) related muscle spasticity
reported, "Although there was variation in the outcome measures reported in
these studies, a trend of reduced spasticity in treated patients was noted."
The authors postulated that "cannabinoids may provide neuroprotective and anti-
inflammatory benefits in MS." A small study done on whether or not cannabis
could be used to control tremors of MS patients was conducted. The study found
that there was no noticeable difference of the tremors in the patients.
Although there was no difference in the tremors the patients felt as if their
symptoms had lessened and their quality of life had improved. The researchers
concluded that the mood enhancing or cognitive effects that cannabis has on the
brain could have given the patients the effect that their tremors were getting
better. Alzheimer's disease. Research done by the Scripps Research Institute in
California shows that the active ingredient in marijuana, THC, prevents the
formation of deposits in the brain associated with Alzheimer's disease. THC was
found to prevent an enzyme called acetylcholinesterase from accelerating the
formation of "Alzheimer plaques" in the brain more effectively than
commercially marketed drugs. THC is also more effective at blocking clumps of
protein that can inhibit memory and cognition in Alzheimer‚Äôs patients, as
reported in Molecular Pharmaceutics. Cannabinoids can also potentially prevent
or slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease by reducing tau protein
phosphorylation, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. Breast cancer.
According to a 2007 and a 2010 study at the California Pacific Medical Center
Research Institute, cannabidiol (CBD) stops breast cancer from spreading
throughout the body by downregulating a gene called ID1. This may provide a
non-toxic alternative to chemotherapy while achieving the same results without
the painful and unpleasant side effects. The research team says that CBD works
by blocking the activity of a gene called ID1, which is believed to be
responsible for a process called metastasis, which is the aggressive spread of
cancer cells away from the original tumor site. HIV/AIDS. Investigators at
Columbia University published clinical trial data in 2007 showing that HIV/AIDS
patients who inhaled cannabis four times daily experienced substantial
increases in food intake with little evidence of discomfort and no impairment
of cognitive performance. They concluded that smoked cannabis has a clear
medical benefit in HIV-positive patients. In another study in 2008, researchers
at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine found that
marijuana significantly reduces HIV-related neuropathic pain when added to a
patient's already-prescribed pain management regimen and may be an "effective
option for pain relief" in those whose pain is not controlled with current
medications. Mood disturbance, physical disability, and quality of life all
improved significantly during study treatment. Despite management with opioids
and other pain modifying therapies, neuropathic pain continues to reduce the
quality of life and daily functioning in HIV-infected individuals. Cannabinoid
receptors in the central and peripheral nervous systems have been shown to
modulate pain perception. No serious adverse effects were reported, according
to the study published by the American Academy of Neurology. A study examining
the effectiveness of different drugs for HIV associated neuropathic pain found
that smoked Cannabis was one of only three drugs that showed evidence of
efficacy. Brain cancer. A study by Complutense University of Madrid found the
chemicals in cannabis promote the death of brain cancer cells by essentially
helping them feed upon themselves in a process called autophagy. The research
team discovered that cannabinoids such as THC had anticancer effects in mice
with human brain cancer cells and in people with brain tumors. When mice with
the human brain cancer cells received the THC, the tumor shrank. Using electron
microscopes to analyze brain tissue taken both before and after a 26- to 30-day
THC treatment regimen, the researchers found that THC eliminated cancer cells
while leaving healthy cells intact. The patients did not have any toxic effects
from the treatment; previous studies of THC for the treatment of cancer have
also found the therapy to be well tolerated. However, the mechanisms which
promote THC's tumor cell‚Äìkilling action are unknown. Opioid dependence.
Injections of THC eliminate dependence on opiates in stressed rats, according
to a research team at the "Laboratory for Physiopathology of Diseases of the
Central Nervous System" (France) in the journal "Neuropsychopharmacology".
Deprived of their mothers at birth, rats become hypersensitive to the rewarding
effect of morphine and heroin (substances belonging to the opiate family), and
rapidly become dependent. When these rats were administered THC, they no longer
developed typical morphine-dependent behavior. In the striatum, a region of the
brain involved in drug dependence, the production of endogenous enkephalins was
restored under THC, whereas it diminished in rats stressed from birth which had
not received THC. Researchers believe the findings could lead to therapeutic
alternatives to existing substitution treatments. In humans, drug treatment
subjects who use cannabis intermittently are found to be more likely to adhere
to treatment for opioid dependence. Historically, similar findings were
reported by Edward Birch, who, in 1889, reported success in treating opiate and
chloral addiction with cannabis. Controlling ALS symptoms. Recent research has
been conducted on if the use of cannabis could control some of the symptoms of
ALS or Lou Gehrig's Disease. A survey was conducted on 131 people who suffered
from ALS. The survey asked if the subjects had used cannabis in the last 12
months to control some of their symptoms. The survey resulted in 13 people who
had used the drug in some form to control symptoms. The survey results found
that cannabis was moderately effective in reducing symptoms of appetite loss,
depression, pain, spasticity, drooling and weakness and the longest relief
reported was for depression. The pattern of symptom relief was consistent with
those reported by people with other conditions, including multiple sclerosis
(Amtmann et al. 2004). Medicinal compounds. Cannabis contains 483 compounds. At
least 80 of these are cannabinoids, which are the basis for medical and
scientific use of cannabis. This presents the research problem of isolating the
effect of specific compounds and taking account of the interaction of these
compounds. Cannabinoids can serve as appetite stimulants, antiemetics,
antispasmodics, and have some analgesic effects. Six important cannabinoids
found in the cannabis plant are tetrahydrocannabinol, tetrahydrocannabinolic
acid, cannabidiol, cannabinol, Œ≤-caryophyllene, and cannabigerol.
Tetrahydrocannabinol. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the primary compound
responsible for the psychoactive effects of cannabis. The compound is a mild
analgesic, and cellular research has shown the compound has antioxidant
activity. THC is believed to interact with parts of the brain normally
controlled by the endogenous cannabinoid neurotransmitter, anandamide.
Anandamide is believed to play a role in pain sensation, memory, and sleep.
Cannabidiol. Cannabidiol (CBD) is a major constituent of medical cannabis. CBD
represents up to 40% of extracts of medical cannabis. Cannabidiol has been
shown to relieve convulsion, inflammation, anxiety, cough, congestion and
nausea, and it inhibits cancer cell growth. Recent studies have shown
cannabidiol to be as effective as atypical antipsychotics in treating
schizophrenia. Because cannabidiol relieves the aforementioned symptoms,
cannabis strains with a high amount of CBD may benefit people with multiple
sclerosis, frequent anxiety attacks and Tourette syndrome. Cannabinol.
Cannabinol (CBN) is a therapeutic cannabinoid found in "Cannabis sativa" and
"Cannabis indica". It is also produced as a metabolite, or a breakdown product,
of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). CBN acts as a weak agonist of the CB1 and CB2
receptors, with lower affinity in comparison to THC. Œ≤-Caryophyllene. Part of
the mechanism by which medical cannabis has been shown to reduce tissue
inflammation is via the compound Œ≤-caryophyllene. A cannabinoid receptor
called CB2 plays a vital part in reducing inflammation in humans and other
animals. Œ≤-Caryophyllene has been shown to be a selective activator of the CB2
receptor. Œ≤-Caryophyllene is especially concentrated in cannabis essential
oil, which contains about 12‚Äì35% Œ≤-caryophyllene. Cannabigerol. Like
cannabidiol, cannabigerol is not psychoactive. Cannabigerol has been shown to
relieve intraoccular pressure, which may be of benefit in the treatment of
glaucoma. Pharmacologic THC and THC derivatives. In the USA, the FDA has
approved several cannabinoids for use as medical therapies: dronabinol
(Marinol) and nabilone. These medicines are taken orally. These medications are
usually used when first line treatments for nausea and vomiting associated with
cancer chemotherapy fail to work. In extremely high doses and in rare cases
"psychotomimetic" side effects are possible. The other commonly used antiemetic
drugs are not associated with these side effects. Canasol is a cannabis-based
medication for glaucoma that relieves intraocular pressure symptoms associated
with late-stage glaucoma. It was created by an ophthalmologist, Dr. Albert
Lockhart and Dr. Manley E. West, and began distribution in 1987. As of 2003, it
was still being distributed in the United Kingdom, several US states, and
several Caribbean nations. It is notable for being one of the first cannabis-
containing pharmaceuticals to be developed for the modern pharmaceutical market
and being one of the few such pharmaceuticals to have ever been legally
marketed in the United States. The prescription drug Sativex, an extract of
cannabis administered as a sublingual spray, has been approved in Canada for
the adjunctive treatment (use along side other medicines) of both multiple
sclerosis and cancer related pain. Sativex has also been approved in the United
Kingdom, New Zealand, and the Czech Republic, and is expected to gain approval
in other European countries. William Notcutt is one of the chief researchers
that has developed Sativex, and he has been working with GW and founder
Geoffrey Guy since the company's inception in 1998. Notcutt states that the use
of MS as the disease to study "had everything to do with politics." Difference
between "Cannabis indica" and "Cannabis sativa". "Cannabis indica" may have a
CBD:THC ratio 4‚Äì5 times that of "Cannabis sativa". Cannabis strains with
relatively high CBD:THC ratios are less likely to induce anxiety than vice
versa. This may be due to CBD's antagonistic effects at the cannabinoid
receptors, compared to THC's partial agonist effect. CBD is also a 5-HT1A
receptor agonist, which may also contribute to an anxiolytic effect. This
likely means the high concentrations of CBD found in "Cannabis indica" mitigate
the anxiogenic effect of THC significantly. The effects of "sativa" are well
known for its cerebral high, hence used daytime as medical cannabis, while
"indica" are well known for its sedative effects and preferred night time as
medical cannabis. Criticism. One of the major criticisms of cannabis as
medicine is opposition to smoking as a method of consumption. However, smoking
is no longer necessary due to the development of healthier methods. Today,
medicinal cannabis patients can use vaporizers, where the essential cannabis
compounds are extracted and inhaled. In addition, edible cannabis, which is
produced in various baked goods, is also available, and has demonstrated longer
lasting effects. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an
advisory against "smoked" medical cannabis stating that, "marijuana has a high
potential for abuse, has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the
United States, and has a lack of accepted safety for use under medical
supervision. The National Institute on Drug Abuse NIDA state that "Marijuana
itself is an unlikely medication candidate for several reasons: (1) it is an
unpurified plant containing numerous chemicals with unknown health effects; (2)
it is typically consumed by smoking further contributing to potential adverse
effects; and (3) its cognitive impairing effects may limit its utility". The
Institute of Medicine, run by the United States National Academy of Sciences,
conducted a comprehensive study in 1999 to assess the potential health benefits
of cannabis and its constituent cannabinoids. The study concluded that smoking
cannabis is not recommended for the treatment of any disease condition, but did
conclude that nausea, appetite loss, pain and anxiety can all be mitigated by
marijuana. While the study expressed reservations about smoked cannabis due to
the health risks associated with smoking, the study team concluded that until
another mode of ingestion was perfected that could provide the same relief as
smoked cannabis, there was no alternative. In addition, the study pointed out
the inherent difficulty in marketing a non-patentable herb. Pharmaceutical
companies will not substantially profit unless there is a patent. For those
reasons, the Institute of Medicine concluded that there is little future in
smoked cannabis as a medically approved medication. The report also concluded
that for certain patients, such as the terminally ill or those with
debilitating symptoms, the long-term risks are not of great concern. Marinol
was less effective than the steroid megestrol in helping cancer patients regain
lost appetites. A phase III study found no difference in effects of an oral
cannabis extract or THC on appetite and quality of life (QOL) in patients with
cancer-related anorexia-cachexia syndrome (CACS) to placebo. "Citing the
dangers of cannabis and the lack of clinical research supporting its medicinal
value" the American Society of Addiction Medicine in March 2011 issued a white
paper recommending a halt to using marijuana as a medicine in U.S. states where
it has been declared legal. Mental disorders. A study of 50,000 Swedish
soldiers who had smoked at least once were twice as likely to develop
schizophrenia as those who had not smoked. The study concluded that either
smoking caused a higher rate of schizophrenia, or that those with schizophrenia
were more likely to be drawn to cannabis. A study by Keele University
commissioned by the British government found that between 1996 and 2005 there
had been significant reductions in the incidence and prevalence of
schizophrenia. From 2000 onwards there were also significant reductions in the
prevalence of psychoses. The authors say this data is "not consistent with the
hypothesis that increasing cannabis use in earlier decades is associated with
increasing schizophrenia or psychoses from the mid-1990s onwards". Method of
consumption. The harm caused by smoking can be minimized or eliminated by the
use of a vaporizer or ingesting the drug in an edible form. Vaporizers are
devices that heat the active constituents to a temperature below the ignition
point of the cannabis, so that their vapors can be inhaled. Combustion of plant
material is avoided, thus preventing the formation of carcinogens such as
polyaromatic hydrocarbons, benzene and carbon monoxide. A pilot study led by
Donald Abrams of UC San Francisco showed that vaporizers eliminate the release
of irritants and toxic compounds, while delivering equivalent amounts of THC
into the bloodstream. According to Matthew Seamon and his co-authors
‚ÄúVaporizers are the optimal route of administration because they allow for
rapid and complete absorption with minimal combustible byproducts, often
considered the major health risk associated with smoking tobacco.‚Äù In order
to kill microorganisms, especially the molds "A. fumigatus", "A. flavus" and
"A. niger", Levitz and Diamond suggested baking marijuana at for five minutes.
They also found that tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) was not degraded by this
process. Organizational positions. Other medical organizations recommend a halt
to using marijuana as a medicine in U.S. History. Ancient China and Taiwan.
Cannabis, called "m√°" (meaning "hemp; cannabis; numbness") or "d√ m√°" (with
"big; great") in Chinese, was used in Taiwan for fiber starting about 10,000
years ago. The botanist Li Hui-Lin wrote that in China, "The use of Cannabis in
medicine was probably a very early development. Since ancient humans used hemp
seed as food, it was quite natural for them to also discover the medicinal
properties of the plant." The oldest Chinese pharmacopeia, the (ca. 100 CE)
"Shennong Bencaojing" Á•ûËæ≤Êú¨ËçâÁ∂ì ("Shennong's Materia Medica Classic"),
describes "dama" "cannabis". Bretschneider, Emil (1895). "Botanicon Sinicum:
Notes on Chinese Botany from Native and Western Sources. Part III, Botanical
Investigations in the Materia Medica of the Ancient Chinese". Kelly & Walsh. p.
378. In the early 3rd century CE, Hua Tuo was the first person known to use
cannabis as an anesthetic. He reduced the plant to powder and mixed it with
wine for administration. In China, the era of Han Western, the 3rd century the
great surgeon Hua Tuo conducts operations under anesthesia using Indian hemp.
The Chinese term for anesthesia (È∫ªÈÜâ: m√° zui ) is also composed of the
ideogram which means hemp, followed by means of intoxication. Elizabeth Wayland
Barber says the Chinese evidence "proves a knowledge of the narcotic properties
of "Cannabis" at least from the 1st millennium B.C." when "ma" was already used
in a secondary meaning of "numbness; senseless." "Such a strong drug, however,
suggests that the Chinese pharmacists had now obtained from far to the
southwest not THC-bearing "Cannabis sativa" but "Cannabis indica", so strong it
knocks you out cold. Cannabis is one of the 50 "fundamental" herbs in
traditional Chinese medicine, and is prescribed to treat diverse indications.

Shanghai: American Presbyterian Mission Press. pp. 90‚Äì91. ‚ÄúMedical use of
cannabis included, rheumatism, intestinal constipation, female reproductive
system disorders, malaria, and other uses‚Äù (Zuardi, 2006, 4). Ancient Egypt.
The Ebers Papyrus (ca. 1550 BCE) from Ancient Egypt describes medical cannabis.
Other ancient Egyptian papyri that mention medical cannabis are the Ramesseum
III Papyrus (1700 BC), the Berlin Papyrus (1300 BC) and the Chester Beatty
Medical Papyrus VI (1300 BC). The ancient Egyptians even used hemp (cannabis)
in suppositories for relieving the pain of hemorrhoids. Around 2,000 B.C., the
ancient Egyptians used cannabis to treat sore eyes. The egyptologist Lise
Manniche notes the reference to "plant medical cannabis" in several Egyptian
texts, one of which dates back to the eighteenth century BCE. Ramesseum III

from ancient India confirm that cannabis' psychoactive properties were
recognized, and doctors used it for treating a variety of illnesses and
ailments. These included insomnia, headaches, a whole host of gastrointestinal
disorders, and pain: cannabis was frequently used to relieve the pain of
childbirth. In India, the use of cannabis was widely disseminated, both as a
medicine and as a recreational drug. Such a broad use may be due to the fact
that cannabis maintained a straight association with religion, which assigned
sacred virtues to the plant‚Äù (Zuardi, 2006, 3). Ancient Greece. [[File:
Cavalcade frieze Parthenon (1) BM.jpg|thumb|right|The Ancient Greeks used
cannabis not only for human medicine, but also in veterinary medicine to dress
wounds and sores on their horses. ]] The Ancient Greeks used cannabis to dress
wounds and sores on their horses. In humans, dried leaves of cannabis were used
to treat nose bleeds, and cannabis seeds were used to expel tapeworms. The most
frequently described use of cannabis in humans was to steep green seeds of
cannabis in either water or wine, later taking the seeds out and using the warm
extract to treat inflammation and pain resulting from obstruction of the ear.
In the 5th century BCE Herodotus, a Greek historian, described how the
Scythians of the Middle East used cannabis in steam baths. South East Asia.
Patani from Asia are primary natural producers of the diuretic, antiemetic,
antiepileptic, anti-inflammatory, pain killing and antipyretic properties of
"Cannabis sativa", and used it extensively for 'Kopi Kapuganja' and 'Pecel
Ganja', as recreation food, drinks and relaxing medication for centuries.
Medieval Islamic world. In the medieval Islamic world, Arabic physicians made
use of the diuretic, antiemetic, antiepileptic, anti-inflammatory, pain killing
and antipyretic properties of "Cannabis sativa", and used it extensively as
medication from the 8th to 18th centuries. Modern history. An Irish physician,
William Brooke O'Shaughnessy, is credited with introducing the therapeutic use
of cannabis to Western medicine. He was Assistant-Surgeon and Professor of
Chemistry at the Medical College of Calcutta, and conducted a cannabis
experiment in the 1830s, first testing his preparations on animals, then
administering them to patients in order to help treat muscle spasms, stomach
cramps or general pain. Cannabis as a medicine became common throughout much of
the Western world by the 19th century. It was used as the primary pain reliever
until the invention of aspirin. Modern medical and scientific inquiry began
with doctors like O'Shaughnessy and Moreau de Tours, who used it to treat
melancholia and migraines, and as a sleeping aid, analgesic and anticonvulsant.
At the local level authorities introduced various laws that required the
mixtures that contained cannabis, that was not sold on prescription, must be
marked with warning labels under the so-called poison laws. A Swedish lexicon
printed in 1912 describes cannabis drug and cannabis extract as a now with us
deserted method for medical treatment. There were at least 2000 cannabis
medicines prior to 1937 with over 280 manufacturers. Later in the century,
researchers investigating methods of detecting cannabis intoxication discovered
that smoking the drug reduced intraocular pressure. In 1955 the antibacterial
effects were described at the Palack√Ω University of Olomouc. Since 1971 Lum√≠r
Ond≈ôej Hanu≈° was growing cannabis for his scientific research on two large
fields in authority of the University. The marijuana extracts were then used at
the University hospital as a cure for aphthae and haze. In 1973 physician Tod
H. Mikuriya reignited the debate concerning cannabis as medicine when he
published "Marijuana Medical Papers". High intraocular pressure causes
blindness in glaucoma patients, so he hypothesized that using the drug could
prevent blindness in patients. Many Vietnam War veterans also found that the
drug prevented muscle spasms caused by spinal injuries suffered in battle.
Later medical use focused primarily on its role in preventing the wasting
syndromes and chronic loss of appetite associated with chemotherapy and AIDS,
along with a variety of rare muscular and skeletal disorders. In 1964, Dr.
Albert Lockhart and Manley West began studying the health effects of
traditional cannabis use in Jamaican communities. They discovered that
Rastafarians had unusually low glaucoma rates and local fishermen were washing
their eyes with cannibis extract in the belief that it would improve their
sight. Lockhart and West developed, and in 1987 gained permission to market,
the pharmaceutical Canasol: one of the first to cannabis extracts. They
continued to work with cannabis throughout the years, developing more
pharmaceuticals and eventually receiving the Jamaican Order of Merit for their
work. Later, in the 1970s, a synthetic version of THC was produced and approved
for use in the United States as the drug Marinol. It was delivered as a
capsule, to be swallowed. Patients complained that the violent nausea
associated with chemotherapy made swallowing capsules difficult. Further, along
with ingested cannabis, capsules are harder to dose-titrate accurately than
smoked cannabis because their onset of action is so much slower. Smoking has
remained the route of choice for many patients because its onset of action
provides almost immediate relief from symptoms and because that fast onset
greatly simplifies titration. For these reasons, and because of the
difficulties arising from the way cannabinoids are metabolized after being
ingested, oral dosing is probably the least satisfactory route for cannabis
administration. Relatedly, some studies have indicated that at least some of
the beneficial effects that cannabis can provide may derive from synergy among
the multiplicity of cannabinoids and other chemicals present in the dried plant
material. Such synergy is, by definition, impossible with respect to the use of
single-cannabinoid drugs like Marinol. During the 1970s and 1980s, six U.S.
states' health departments performed studies on the use of medical cannabis.
These are widely considered some of the most useful and pioneering studies on
the subject. Voters in eight states showed their support for cannabis
prescriptions or recommendations given by physicians between 1996 and 1999,
including Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Maine, Michigan, Nevada,
Oregon, and Washington, going against policies of the federal government. In
May 2001, "The Chronic Cannabis Use in the Compassionate Investigational New
Drug Program: An Examination of Benefits and Adverse Effects of Legal Clinical
Cannabis" (Russo, Mathre, Byrne et al.) was completed. This three-day
examination of major body functions of four of the five living US federal
cannabis patients found "mild pulmonary changes" in two patients. National and
international regulations. Medical use of cannabis or preparation containing
THC as the active substance is legalized in Canada, Belgium, Austria,
Netherlands, UK, Spain, Israel, Finland and some states in the U.S., although
it is still illegal under U.S. federal law. The convention thus allows
countries to outlaw cannabis for all non-research purposes but lets nations
choose to allow medical and scientific purposes if they believe total
prohibition is not the most appropriate means of protecting health and welfare.
The convention requires that states that permit the production or use of
medical cannabis must operate a licensing system for all
cultivators,manufacturers and distributors and ensure that the total cannabis
market of the state shall not exceed that required "for medical and scientific
purposes." Africa. Cannabis has been used in Africa since at least the 15th
century. Its use was introduced by Arab traders, somehow connected to India.
‚ÄúIn Africa, the plant was used for snake bite, to facilitate childbirth,
malaria, fever, blood poisoning, anthrax, asthma, and dysentery.‚Äù (Zuardi,
2006, 4) Though African governments have tried to limit and stop its use, it
still seems to be deeply ingrained, mostly through religious rituals. Austria.
In Austria both Œî9-THC and pharmaceutical preparations containing Œî9-THC are
listed in annex V of the Narcotics Decree ("Suchtgiftverordnung"). Compendial
formulations are manufactured upon prescription according to the German "Neues
Rezeptur-Formularium". On July 9, 2008, the Austrian Parliament approved
cannabis cultivation for scientific and medical uses. Cannabis cultivation is
controlled by the Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety ("√ñsterreichische
Agentur f√ºr Gesundheit und Ern√§hrungssicherheit, AGES"). Canada. Category 2
is for applicants who have debilitating symptom(s) of medical condition(s),
other than those described in Category 1. The application of eligible patients
must be supported by a medical practitioner. The cannabis distributed by Health
Canada is provided under the brand CannaMed by the company Prairie Plant
Systems Inc. In 2006, 420¬ kg of CannaMed cannabis was sold, representing an
increase of 80% over the previous year. However, patients complain of the
single strain selection as well as low potency, providing a pre-ground product
put through a wood chipper (which deteriorates rapidly) as well as gamma
irradation and foul taste and smell. It is also legal for patients approved by
Health Canada to grow their own cannabis for personal consumption, and it's
possible to obtain a production license as a person designated by a patient.
Designated producers were permitted to grow a cannabis supply for only a single
patient, however. That regulation and related restrictions on supply were found
unconstitutional by the Federal Court of Canada in January, 2008. The court
found that these regulations did not allow a sufficient legal supply of medical
cannabis, and thus forced many patients to purchase their medicine from
unauthorized, black market sources. This was the eighth time in the previous
ten years that the courts ruled against Health Canada's regulations restricting
the supply of the medicine. In Canada there are four forms of medical cannabis.
The first one is a cannabis extract called Sativex that contains THC and
cannabidiol in a spray form. The second is a synthetic or manmade THC called
dronabinol marketed as Marinol. The third also a synthetic version of THC
called nabilone that is called Cesamet on the markets. The fourth product is
the herbal form of cannabis often referred to as marijuana. Germany. In
February 2008, seven German patients could legally be treated with medicinal
cannabis, distributed by prescription in pharmacies. To regulate therapeutic
use, Germany modeled on Dutch neighbor who distributes this way since in 2003
(120¬ kg in 2008). In Germany dronabinol was rescheduled in 1994 from annex I
to annex II of the Narcotics Law ("Bet√§ubungsmittelgesetz") in order to ease
research; in 1998 dronabinol was rescheduled from annex II to annex III and
since then has been available by prescription, whereas Œî9-THC is still listed
in annex I. Manufacturing instructions for dronabinol containing compendial
formulations are described in the "Neues Rezeptur-Formularium". Israel.
Marijuana for medical use has been permitted in Israel since the early 1990s
for cancer patients and those with pain-related illnesses such as Parkinson's,
multiple sclerosis, Crohn‚Äôs Disease, other chronic pain and post-traumatic
stress disorder. Patients can smoke the drug, ingest it in liquid form, or
apply it to the skin as a balm. The numbers of patients authorized to use
marijuana in Israel in 2012 is about 10,000. There are eight government-
sanctioned cannabis growing operations in Israel, which distribute it for
medical purposes to patients who have a prescription from a doctor, via either
a company's store, or in a medical center. THC, the psychoactive chemical
component in marijuana that causes a high, was first isolated by Israeli
scientists Raphael Mechoulam of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem‚Äôs Center
for Research on Pain and Yechiel Gaoni of the Weizmann Institute in 1964. The
Tikkin Olam company has developed a variety of marijuana that is reported to
provide the medical benefits of cannabis, but without THC. The cannabis is
instead made with high quantities of CBD, a substance that is believed to be an
anti-inflammatory ingredient, which helps alleviate pain. Netherlands. Since
2003, the country's pharmacies distribute medicinal cannabis (pharmaceutical
form of the natural plant) by prescription, in addition to other drugs
containing cannabinoids (dronabinol, Sativex). The Office of Medicinal Cannabis
(BMC), which reports to the Ministry of Health and Sports of the Netherlands,
is responsible for ensuring control of the distribution of these new medicines.
In 2008, 120¬ kg of medical marijuana were sold through the network of
pharmacies at a price of about 7 ‚Ç¨ / g. Spain. In Spain, since the late 1990s
and early 2000s, medical cannabis underwent a process of progressive
decriminalization and legalisation. The parliament of the region of Catalonia
was the first in Spain to have voted unanimously in 2001 legalizing medical
marijuana; it was quickly followed by parliaments of Aragon and the Balearic
Islands. The Spanish Penal Code prohibits the sale of cannabis but it does not
prohibit consumption (although consumption on the street is fined). Until early
2000, the Penal Code did not distinguish between therapeutic use of cannabis
and recreational use, however, several court decisions show that this
distinction is increasingly taken into account by judges. From 2006, the sale
of seed is legalized, the sale and public consumption remains illegal, and
private cultivation and use are permitted. Several studies have been conducted
to study the effects of cannabis on patients suffering from diseases like
cancer, AIDS, multiple sclerosis, seizures or asthma. This research was
conducted by various Spanish agencies at the Universidad Complutense de Madrid
headed by Manuel Guzman, the hospital of La Laguna in Tenerife led neurosurgeon
Luis Gonz√°lez Feria or the University of Barcelona. Several cannabis
consumption clubs and user associations have been established throughout Spain.
These clubs, the first of which was created in 1991, are non-profit
associations who grow cannabis and sell it at cost to its members. The legal
status of these clubs is uncertain: in 1997, four members of the first club,
the Barcelona Ram√≥n Santos Association of Cannabis Studies, were sentenced to
4 months in prison and a 3000 euro fine, while at about the same time, the
court of Bilbao ruled that another club was not in violation of the law. The
Andalusian regional government also commissioned a study by criminal law
professors on the "Therapeutic use of cannabis and the creation of
establishments of acquisition and consumption. The study concluded that such
clubs are legal as long as they distribute only to a restricted list of legal
adults, provide only the amount of drugs necessary for immediate consumption,
and not earn a profit. The Andalusian government never formally accepted these
guidelines and the legal situation of the clubs remains insecure. In 2006 and
2007, members of these clubs were acquitted in trial for possession and sale of
cannabis and the police were ordered to return seized crops. United Kingdom. In
England and Wales, the use of cannabis medicinally is accepted as a mitigating
factor under Sentencing Council guidelines, if it is being cultivated or found
in possession of someone. However, in the United Kingdom, possession of small
quantities of cannabis does not usually warrant an arrest or court appearance
(street cautions or fines are often given out instead). Under UK law, certain
cannabinoids are permitted medically, but these are strictly controlled with
many provisos under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (in the 1985 amendments). The
British Medical Association's official stance is "users of cannabis for medical
purposes should be aware of the risks, should enroll for clinical trials, and
should talk to their doctors about new alternative treatments; but we do not
advise them to stop." United States. In the United States federal level of
government, cannabis "" has been made criminal by implementation of the
Controlled Substances Act which classifies cannabis as a Schedule I drug, the
strictest classification on par with heroin, LSD and ecstasy, and the Supreme
Court ruled in 2005 that the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution allowed
the government to ban the use of cannabis, including medical use. The United
States Food and Drug Administration states "marijuana has a high potential for
abuse, has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States,
and has a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision". Two
American (for-profit) companies, Cannabis Science Inc., and Medical Marijuana,
Inc., are working towards getting FDA approval for cannabis based medicines
(including smoked cannabis). Cannabis Science Inc. wants to have medical
cannabis approved by the FDA so anyone, regardless of state, will have access
to the medicine. Also, there is one non-profit organization, the
Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) working towards
getting Cannabis approved by the FDA for PTSD. Since the medical marijuana
movement began, twenty states and the District of Columbia, starting with
California in 1996, have legalized medical cannabis or effectively
decriminalized it: Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut,
Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey,
New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Washington; and Washington
D.C. Maryland allows for reduced or no penalties if cannabis use has a medical
basis. Despite its legality in Washington, and Michigan, an employee can still
be fired if they test positive on a drug test, despite having a doctor's
recommendation. California, Colorado, New Mexico, Maine, Rhode Island, Montana,
and Michigan are currently the only states to utilize dispensaries to sell
medical cannabis. Connecticut will be the eighth but has yet to issue any
licenses. California's medical cannabis industry took in about $2 billion a
year and generated $100 million in state sales taxes during 2008 with an
estimated 2,100 dispensaries, co-operatives, wellness clinics and taxi delivery
services in the sector colloquially known as ‚Äúcannabusiness‚Äù. On 19 October
2009 the US Deputy Attorney General issued a US Department of Justice
memorandum to "All United States Attorneys" providing clarification and
guidance to federal prosecutors in US States that have enacted laws authorizing
the medical use of marijuana. The document is intended solely as "a guide to
the exercise of investigative and prosecutorial discretion and as guidance on
resource allocation and federal priorities." The US Deputy Attorney General
David W. Ogden provided seven criteria, the application of which acts as a
guideline to prosecutors and federal agents to ascertain whether a patient's
use, or their caregiver's provision, of medical cannabis "represents part of a
recommended treatment regiment consistent with applicable state law", and
recommends against prosecuting patients using medical cannabis products
according to state laws. Not applying those criteria, the Dep. Attorney General
Ogden concludes, would likely be "an inefficient use of limited federal
resources". The memorandum does not change any laws. Sale of cannabis remains
illegal under federal law. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's position,
that marijuana has no accepted value in the treatment of any disease in the
United States, has also remained the same. The Health and Human Services
Division of the federal government holds a patent for medical cannabis. The
patent, "Cannabinoids as antioxidants and neuroprotectants", issued October
2003 reads:
