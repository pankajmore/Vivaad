University of Texas at Austin The University of Texas at Austin (informally
University of Texas, UT Austin or UT) is a state research university, and is
the flagship institution of the University of Texas¬ System. Founded in 1883,
its campus is approximately from the Texas State Capitol in Austin. The
institution has the fifth-largest single-campus enrollment in the nation as of
fall 2010 (and had the largest enrollment in the country from 1997 to 2003),
with over 50,000 undergraduate and graduate students and over 24,000 faculty
and staff. It currently holds the second largest enrollment in Texas behind
Texas A&M University. The University of Texas at Austin was named one of the
original eight Public Ivy institutions and was inducted into the American
Association of Universities in 1929. The university is a major center for
academic research, with research expenditures exceeding $640 million for the
2009‚Äì2010 school year. The university houses seven museums and seventeen
libraries, including the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum and the
Blanton Museum of Art, and operates various auxiliary research facilities, such
as the J. J. Pickle Research Campus and the McDonald Observatory. Among
university faculty are recipients of the Nobel Prize, Pulitzer Prize, the Wolf
Prize, and the National Medal of Science, as well as many other awards. UT
Austin student athletes compete as the Texas Longhorns and are members of the
Big 12 Conference. The university has won four NCAA Division I National
Football Championships, and has claimed more titles in men's and women's sports
than any other school in the Big 12 since the league was founded in 1996.
Current and former UT Austin athletes have won 117 Olympic medals, including 14
in Beijing in 2008. The university was recognized by "Sports Illustrated" as
"America's Best Sports College" in 2002. History. Establishment. The first
mention of a public university in Texas can be traced to the 1827 constitution
for the Mexican state of Coahuila y Tejas. Although an article promised to
establish public education in the arts and sciences, no action was taken by the
Mexican government. But after Texas obtained its independence from Mexico in
1836, the Congress of Texas adopted the Constitution of the Republic, which
included a provision to establish public education in the republic, including
two universities or colleges. On January 26, 1839, the Congress of Texas agreed
to eventually set aside fifty leagues of land towards the effort; in addition,
in the new capital of Austin were reserved and designated "College Hill." In
1845, Texas was annexed into the United States of America. The state
legislature passed the Act of 1858, which set aside $100,000 in United States
bonds towards construction of a university. In addition, the legislature
designated land, previously reserved for the encouragement of railroad
construction, toward the universities' fifty leagues. But Texas's secession
from the Union and the American Civil War prevented further action on these
plans. After the war, the 1862 Morrill Act facilitated the creation of what is
now Texas A&M University, which was established in 1876 as the Agricultural &
Mechanical College of Texas. The Texas Constitution of 1876 mandated that the
state establish a university "at an early day," calling for the creation of a
"university of the first class," styled "The University of Texas." It revoked
the endowment of the railroad lands of the Act of 1858 but appropriated in West
Texas. In 1883, another two million were granted, with income from the sale of
land and grazing rights going to The University of Texas and Texas A&M. In
1881, Austin was chosen as the site of the main university, and Galveston was
designated the location of the medical department. On the original "College
Hill," an official ceremony began construction on what is now referred to as
the old Main Building in late 1882. The university opened its doors on
September 15, 1883. Expansion and growth. The old Victorian-Gothic Main
Building served as the central point of the campus's site, and was used for
nearly all purposes. But by the 1930s, discussions arose about the need for new
library space, and the Main Building was razed in 1934 over the objections of
many students and faculty. The modern-day tower and Main Building were
constructed in its place. In 1910, George Brackenridge donated on the Colorado
River to the university . A vote by the regents to move the campus to the
donated land was met with outrage, and the land has only been used for
auxiliary purposes such as graduate student housing. Part of the tract was sold
in the late-1990s for luxury housing, and there are controversial proposals to
sell the remainder of the tract. The Brackenridge Field Laboratory was
established on of the land in 1967. As a result of the controversy, in 1921,
the legislature appropriated $1,350,000 for the purchase of land adjacent to
the main campus. But expansion was hampered by the constitutional restriction
against funding the construction of buildings. With the discovery of oil on
university-owned grounds in 1923, the institution was able to put its new
wealth towards its general endowment fund. These savings allowed the passing of
amendments to make way for bond issues in 1931 and 1947, with the latter
expansion necessary from the spike in enrollment following World War II. The
university built 19 permanent structures between 1950 and 1965, when it was
given the right of eminent domain. With this power, the university purchased
additional properties surrounding the original . During World War II, the
University of Texas was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that
took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a
path to a Navy commission. 1966 shooting spree. On August 1, 1966, Texas
student Charles Whitman barricaded the observation deck in the tower of the
Main Building. With two rifles, a sawed-off shotgun and various other weapons,
he killed 16 people on campus from the observation deck, below the clocks on
the tower and three more in the tower, as well as wounding two more inside the
observation deck. Whitman had been a patient at the University Health Center,
and on March 29, preceding the shootings, had conveyed to psychiatrist Maurice
Heatley his feelings of overwhelming hostilities and that he was thinking about
"going up on the tower with a deer rifle and start shooting people." Following
the Whitman event, the observation deck was closed until 1968, and then closed
again in 1975 following a series of suicide jumps during the 1970s. In 1999,
after installation of security fencing and other safety precautions, the tower
observation deck reopened to the public. Recent history. The first presidential
library on a university campus was dedicated on May 22, 1971 with former
President Johnson, Lady Bird Johnson and then-President Richard Nixon in
attendance. Constructed on the eastern side of the main campus, the Lyndon
Baines Johnson Library and Museum is one of 13 presidential libraries
administered by the National Archives and Records Administration. The
University of Texas has experienced a wave of new construction recently with
several significant buildings. On April 30, 2006, the school opened the Blanton
Museum of Art. In August 2008, the AT&T Executive Education and Conference
Center opened, with the hotel and conference center forming part of a new
gateway to the university. Also in 2008, Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium
was expanded to a seating capacity of 100,119, making it the largest stadium
(by capacity) in the state of Texas. On the morning of September 28, 2010, 19-
year-old Colton Tooley opened fire on campus with an AK-47 semi-automatic
rifle, resulting in a lockdown of the university campus. He then walked into
the Perry-Casta√±eda Library and committed suicide. On January 19, 2011, the
university announced the creation of a 24-hour television network in
partnership with ESPN, dubbed the Longhorn Network. ESPN will pay a $300
million guaranteed rights fee over 20 years to the university and to IMG
College, UT Austin's multimedia rights partner. The network covers the
university's intercollegiate athletics, music, cultural arts and academics
programs. The channel first aired in September 2011. Campus. The University's
property totals , comprising the for the Main Campus in central Austin and
other the J. J. Pickle Research Campus in north Austin and the other properties
throughout Texas. The main campus has 150 buildings totalling over . One of the
University's most visible features is the Beaux-Arts Main Building, including a
tower designed by Paul Philippe Cret. Completed in 1937, the Main Building is
in the middle of campus. The tower usually appears illuminated in white light
in the evening but is lit orange for various special occasions, including
athletic victories and academic accomplishments; it is conversely darkened for
solemn occasions. At the top of the tower is a carillon of 56 bells, the
largest in Texas. Songs are played on weekdays by student carillonneurs, in
addition to the usual pealing of Westminster Quarters every quarter hour
between 6¬ am and 9¬ pm In 1998, after the installation of security and safety
measures, the observation deck reopened to the public indefinitely for weekend
tours. The university's seven museums and seventeen libraries hold over nine
million volumes, making it the seventh-largest academic library in the country.
The holdings of the university's Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center
include one of only 21 remaining complete copies of the Gutenberg Bible and the
first permanent photograph, "View from the Window at Le Gras", taken by
Nic√©phore Ni√©pce. The newest museum, the Blanton Museum of Art, is the
largest university art museum in the United States and hosts approximately
17,000 works from Europe, the United States, and Latin America. The University
of Texas has an extensive underground tunnel system that links all of the
buildings on campus. Constructed in the 1930s under the supervision of creator
Carl Eckhardt, then head of the physical plant, the tunnels have grown along
with the university campus. They currently measure approximately six miles in
total length. The tunnel system is used for communications and utility service.
It is closed to the public and is guarded by silent alarms. Since the late
1940s the university has generated its own electricity. Today its natural gas
cogeneration plant has a capacity of 123 MW. The university also operates a 1.1
megawatt TRIGA nuclear reactor at the J.J. Pickle Research Campus. The
university continues to expand its facilities on campus. In 2010, the
university opened the state-of-the-art Norman Hackerman building (on the
location of the former Experimental Sciences Building) housing chemistry and
biology research and teaching laboratories. In 2010, the university broke
ground on the $120 million Bill & Melinda Gates Computer Science Complex and
Dell Computer Science Hall and the $51 million Belo Center for New Media, both
of which are slated to open in 2012. The new LEED gold-certified, Student
Activity Center (SAC) opened in January 2011, housing study rooms, lounges and
food vendors. The SAC was constructed as a result of a student referendum
passed in 2006 which raised student fees by $65 per semester. The university
operates a public radio station, KUT, which provides local FM broadcasts as
well as live streaming audio over the Internet. The university uses Capital
Metro to provide bus transportation for students around the campus and
throughout Austin. Academic profile. UT Austin is consistently ranked as one of
the top public universities in the country, with highly prestigious programs in
a variety of fields. Nationally, UT Austin ranked 45th amongst all universities
according to "U.S. News and World Report", and tied for 13th place among public
universities in 2011. The University of Texas School of Architecture was ranked
second among national undergraduate programs in 2012. Additionally, the McCombs
School of Business was ranked seventh among undergraduate business programs in
2010, and the Cockrell School of Engineering was ranked ninth among
undergraduate engineering programs in 2009. Internationally, UT Austin was
ranked 67th in the "World's Best Universities" ranking presented by "U.S. News
and World Report", and ranked 35th in the world by Shanghai Jiao Tong
University, based on factors such as Nobel laureate affiliation and number of
highly cited researchers. In 2009, The Economist ranked the school 49th
worldwide. In 2012, Times Higher Education ranked the university 25th in the
world, while Human Resources & Labor Review ranked the university 43th
internationally. As of 2010, "U.S. News and World Report" ranked forty-three UT
graduate programs and specialties in the top ten nationally, and another fifty-
three others ranked in the top 25. Among these programs include the number two-
ranked College of Education, the fourth-ranked College of Pharmacy, the eighth-
ranked Cockrell School of Engineering, the and the 14th-ranked School of Law.
Four UT graduate programs were ranked first in the nation, including Accounting
and Petroleum Engineering. The MBA program in the McCombs School of Business
was ranked 16th nationally in 2010. A 2005 Bloomberg survey ranked the school
5th among all business schools and first among public business schools for the
largest number of alumni who are S&P 500 CEOs. Similarly, a 2005 "USA Today"
report ranked the university as "the number one source of new Fortune 1000
CEOs." A "payback" analysis published by SmartMoney in 2011 comparing
graduates' salaries to tuition costs concluded that the school was the second-
best value of all colleges in the nation, behind only Georgia Tech. Colleges
and schools. In addition, the university has seven honors programs that span a
variety of academic fields: Liberal Arts Honors, the Business Honors Program,
the Turing Scholars Program in Computer Sciences, Engineering Honors, the
Health Science Honors Program in Natural Sciences, the Dean's Scholars Honors
Program in Natural Sciences, and the interdisciplinary Plan II Honors program.
The university also offers innovative programs for promoting academic
excellence and leadership development such as the Freshman Research Initiative
and Texas Interdisciplinary Plan. The University of Texas at Austin offers more
than 100 undergraduate and 170 graduate degrees. In the 2009‚Äì2010 academic
year, the university awarded a total of 13,215 degrees: 67.7% bachelor's
degrees, 22.0% master's degrees, 6.4% doctoral degrees, and 3.9% Professional
degrees. Admission. As a state public university, the University of Texas at
Austin was, until recently, subject to Texas House Bill 588, which guarantees
graduating Texas high school seniors in the top 10% of their class admission to
any public Texas university. A new state law granting UT (but no other state
university) a partial exemption from the top 10% rule, Senate Bill 175, was
passed by the 81st Legislature in 2009. It modifies this admissions policy by
limiting automatically admitted freshmen to 75% of the entering in-state
freshman class, starting in 2011. The university will admit the top one
percent, the top two percent and so forth until the cap is reached; the
university expects to automatically admit students in the top 8% of their
graduating class for 2011. Furthermore, students admitted under Texas House
Bill 588 are not guaranteed their choice of college or major, but rather only
guaranteed admission to the university as a whole. Many colleges, such as the
Cockrell School of Engineering, have secondary requirements that must be met
for admission. For others who go through the traditional application process,
selectivity is deemed "more selective" according to the Carnegie Foundation for
the Advancement of Teaching. For Fall 2009, 31,362 applied and 45.6% were
accepted, and of those accepted, 51.0% enrolled. The university's freshman
retention rate in 2009 was 92.5% and the six-year graduation rate was 81.0%.
The Fall 2011 entering class had an average ACT composite score of 28 and an
average SAT composite score of 1858. Faculty and research. In Fall 2009, the
school employed 2,770 full-time faculty members (88.3% of whom hold the
terminal degree in their field), with a student-to-faculty ratio of 17.3 to 1.
The university's faculty includes 63 members of the National Academy, winners
of the Nobel Prize, the Pulitzer Prize, the National Medal of Science, the
National Medal of Technology, the Turing Award and other various awards. Nine
Nobel Laureates are or have been affiliated with UT Austin. Except for MIT, UT
Austin attracts more federal research grants than any American university
without a medical school. For the 2009‚Äì2010 school year, the university
exceeded $640 million in research funding (up from $590 million the previous
year) and has earned more than 300 patents since 2003. UT Austin houses the
Office of Technology Commercialization, a technology transfer center which
serves as the bridge between laboratory research and commercial development. In
2009, UT Austin created nine new start-up companies to commercialize technology
developed at the university and has created 46 start-ups in the past seven
years. UT Austin license agreements generated $10.9 million in revenue for the
university in 2009. Research at UT Austin is largely focused in the engineering
and physical sciences, and is a world-leading research institution in fields
such as computer science. Energy is a major research thrust of the university,
with major federally funded projects on biofuels, battery and solar cell
technology, and geological carbon dioxide storage, among others. In 2009, UT
founded the Energy Institute, led by former Under Secretary for Science Raymond
L. Orbach, to organize and advance multi-disciplinary energy research at the
university. While the university does not have a medical school, it houses
medical programs associated with other campuses and allied health professional
programs, as well as major research programs in pharmacy, biomedical
engineering, and neuroscience and others. UT Austin opened the $100 million
Dell Pediatric Research Institute in 2010 as part of an effort to increase
medical research at the university and establish a medical research complex,
and associated medical school, in the city of Austin. UT Austin operates
several major auxiliary research centers. The world's third-largest telescope,
the Hobby-Eberly Telescope, and three other large telescopes are part of UT's
McDonald Observatory, west of Austin. The university manages nearly of
biological field laboratories, including the Brackenridge Field Laboratory in
Austin. The Center for Agile Technology focuses on software development
challenges. The J.J. Pickle Research Campus (PRC) is home to the Texas Advanced
Computing Center which operates the Ranger supercomputer, one of the most
powerful supercomputers in the world, as well as the Microelectronics Research
Center which houses micro- and nanoelectronics research and features a
cleanroom for device fabrication. Founded in 1946, UT's Applied Research
Laboratories at the PRC has been responsible for the development or testing of
the vast majority of high-frequency sonar equipment used by the Navy, and in
2007, was granted a research contract by the Navy funded up to $928 million
over ten years. The Center for Transportation Research UT Austin is a
nationally recognized research institution focusing on transportation research,
education, and public service. Established in 1963 as the Center for Highway
Research, its current and ongoing projects address virtually all aspects of
transportation, including economics, multimodal systems, traffic congestion
relief, transportation policy, materials, structures, transit, environmental
impacts, driver behavior, land use, geometric design, accessibility, and
pavements. Endowment. The university has an endowment of $7.2 billion, out of
the $16.11 billion (according to 2008 estimates) available to the University of
Texas System. This figure reflects the fact that the school has the largest
endowment of any public university in the nation. Thirty percent of the
university's endowment comes from Permanent University Fund (PUF), with nearly
$15 billion in assets as of 2007. Proceeds from lands appropriated in 1839 and
1876, as well as oil monies, comprise the majority of PUF. At one time, the PUF
was the chief source of income for Texas's two university systems, The
University of Texas System and the Texas A&M University System; today, however,
its revenues account for less than 10 percent of the universities' annual
budgets. This has challenged the universities to increase sponsored research
and private donations. Privately funded endowments contribute over $2 billion
to the University's total endowment value. The university is one of only two
public universities in the U.S. that have a triple-A credit rating from all
three major credit rating agencies, along with the University of Virginia.
Student life. Student profile. For Fall 2011, the university enrolled 38,437
undergraduate, 11,497 graduate and 1,178 law students. Out-of-state and
international students comprised 9.1% of the undergraduate student body and
20.1% of the total student body, with students from all 50 states and more than
120 foreign countries‚Äîmost notably, South Korea, followed by the People's
Republic of China, India, Mexico and Taiwan. For Fall 2010, the undergraduate
student body was 48.7% male and 51.3% female. The three largest undergraduate
majors in 2009 were Biological Sciences, Unspecified Business, and Psychology,
while the three largest graduate majors were Business Administration (MBA),
Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Pharmacy (PharmD). Residential life.
The campus is currently home to fourteen residence halls, the newest of which
opened for residence in Spring 2007. On-campus housing can hold more than 7,100
students. Jester Center is the largest residence hall with its capacity of
2,945. Academic enrollment exceeds the on-campus housing capacity; as a result,
most students must live in private residence halls, housing cooperatives,
apartments, or with Greek organizations and other off-campus residences. The
Division of Housing and Food Service, which already has the largest market
share of 7,000 of the estimated 27,000 beds in the campus area, plans to expand
to 9,000 beds in the near future. Student organizations. The university
recognizes more than 1,000 student organizations. In addition, it supports
three official student governance organizations that represent student
interests to faculty, administrators, and the Texas Legislature. Student
Government, established in 1902, is the oldest governance organization and
represents student interests in general. The Senate of College Councils
represents students in academic affairs and coordinates the college councils,
and the Graduate Student Assembly represents graduate student interests. The
University Unions Student Events Center serves as the hub for student
activities on campus. The Friar Society serves as the oldest honor society at
the university. The Texas 4000 for Cancer student organization is the longest
annual charity bicycle ride in the world and has raised over $1.4 million
dollars for cancer research from its founding in 2004 to April, 2009. Greek
life. The University of Texas at Austin is home to an active Greek community.
Approximately 14 percent of undergraduate students are in fraternities or
sororities. With more than 65 national chapters, the university's Greek
community is one of the nation's largest. These chapters are under the
authority of one of the school's six Greek council communities, Interfraternity
Council, National Pan-Hellenic Council, Texas Asian Pan-Hellenic Council,
Latino Pan-Hellenic Council, Multicultural Greek Council and University
Panhellenic Council. Other registered student organizations also name
themselves with Greek letters and are called affiliates. They are not a part of
one of the six councils but have all of the same privileges and
responsibilities of any other organization. According to the Office of the Dean
of Students' mission statement, Greek life promotes cultural appreciation,
scholarship, leadership, and service. Most Greek houses are west of the Drag in
the West Campus neighborhood. Media. Students express their opinions in and out
of class through periodicals including "Study Breaks Magazine", Longhorn Life,
"The Daily Texan" (the most award-winning daily college newspaper in the United
States), and the "Texas Travesty". Over the airwaves students' voices are heard
through K09VR and KVRX. The Computer Writing and Research Lab of the
university's Department of Rhetoric and Writing also hosts "the Blogora", a
blog for "connecting rhetoric, rhetorical methods and theories, and
rhetoricians with public life" by the Rhetoric Society of America. The
university has a yearbook. In the 1980s it annually sold 14,000 copies. In 1997
it sold 1,700, an all-time low. Kathy Lawrence, the media adviser at UT Austin,
said that yearbook sales declined once the school switched from in-person
registration to telephone-based registration. During in-person registrations,
the university often asked students to buy student yearbooks. Lawrence said
that other factors leading to a decline in yearbook sales at UT Austin included
increasing student numbers and declining participation in campus life. As of
2008, about 2,500 copies sell annually. To salvage the yearbook, Lawrence
introduced personalized pages. When Lawrence concluded that social networking
sites lead to a decline in yearbook sales, Sarah Viren of the "Houston
Chronicle" said that Lawrence "eventually opted to hold off on the personalized
pages." Traditions. Traditions at the University of Texas are perpetuated
through several school symbols and mediums. At athletic events, students
frequently sing "Texas Fight", the university's fight song while displaying the
Hook 'em Horns hand gesture‚Äîthe gesture mimicking the horns of the school's
mascot, Bevo the Texas longhorn. Athletics. The University of Texas offers a
wide variety of varsity and intramural sports programs. As of 2008, the
university's athletics program ranked fifth in the nation among Division I
schools according to the National Association of Collegiate Directors of
Athletics. Due to the breadth of sports offered and the quality of the
programs, Texas was selected as "America's Best Sports College" in a 2002
analysis by "Sports Illustrated." Texas was also listed as the number one
Collegiate Licensing Company client for the second consecutive year in regards
to the amount of annual trademark royalties received from fan merchandise
sales. But this ranking is based only on clients of the Collegiate Licensing
Company, which does not handle licensing for approximately three-dozen large
schools including Ohio State, USC, UCLA, Michigan State, and Texas A&M. Varsity
sports. The University's men's and women's athletics teams are nicknamed the
Longhorns. A charter member of the Southwest Conference until it dissolved in
1996, Texas now competes in the Big 12 Conference of the NCAA's Division I-FBS.
Texas has won 47 total national championships, 39 of which are NCAA national
championships. The University of Texas has traditionally been considered a
college football powerhouse. At the start of the 2007 season, the Longhorns
were ranked third in the all-time list of both total wins and winning
percentage. The team experienced its greatest success under coach Darrell
Royal, winning three national championships in 1963, 1969, and 1970. It won a
fourth title under head coach Mack Brown in 2005 after a 41‚Äì38 victory over
previously undefeated Southern California in the 2006 Rose Bowl. In recent
years, the men's basketball team has gained prominence, advancing to the NCAA
Tournament Sweet Sixteen in 2002, the Final Four in 2003, the Sweet Sixteen in
2004, and the Elite Eight in 2006 and 2008. The University's baseball team is
one of the nation's best. It has made more trips to the College World Series
(34) than any other school, and it posted wins in 1949, 1950, 1975, 1983, 2002,
and 2005. Additionally, the University's highly successful men's and women's
swimming and diving teams lay claim to sixteen NCAA Division I titles. The swim
team was first developed under Coach Tex Robertson. In particular, the men's
team is led by Eddie Reese, who served as the head men's coach at the 1992
Summer Olympics in Barcelona, the 2004 Games in Athens and the 2008 Games in
Beijing. Rivalries. The Longhorns had one of the most heated rivalries in all
sports with the Texas A&M Aggies. Up until the 2012 season when the Aggies left
the Big 12 for SEC, the two schools have acknowledged the rivalry's importance
by creating the State Farm Lone Star Showdown series, which encompasses all
sports in which the schools field varsity teams. The football game played
between the two schools is the third-oldest rivalry in the nation and is the
longest-running rivalry for both schools. It ended in 2011 with the 118th game.
The Longhorns led the "showdown," 76‚Äì37‚Äì5. The game was traditionally
played on Thanksgiving day. Both schools held a rally before the annual
football game ‚Äì Texas hosted the Hex Rally, and students at Texas A&M hosted
the Aggie Bonfire (although it is no longer an officially sanctioned Texas A&M
event after 12 students died in 1999). The Longhorns also have a long standing
football rivalry with the Oklahoma Sooners and hold a 59‚Äì41‚Äì5 edge in that
series. Since 1932, the teams have played annually at the Cotton Bowl in
Dallas, Texas, in the Red River Rivalry game. The rivalry has grown in recent
years, as the winner has gone to the Big 12 Conference championship and BCS
National championship games. Other schools, such as University of Arkansas and
Texas Tech, also count Texas among their rivals. But each of these schools also
trail Texas by significant margins in overall series records, 56‚Äì21‚Äì0 and
45‚Äì15‚Äì0, respectively. Alumni. Texas Exes is the official UT alumni
organization. The Alcalde, founded in 1913 and pronounced ‚Äúall-call-day,‚Äù
is the university's alumni magazine. Over 15 graduates have served in the U.S.
Senate and U.S. House of Representatives, such as Lloyd Bentsen '42, who served
as both a U.S. Senator and U.S. Representative, as well as being the 1988
Democratic Party Vice Presidential nominee. Presidential cabinet members
include former United States Secretary of State James Baker '57, former United
States Secretary of Education William J. Bennett, and former United States
Secretary of Commerce Donald Evans '73. Former First Lady Laura Bush '73 and
daughter Jenna '04 both graduated from Texas, as well as former First Lady Lady
Bird Johnson '33 & '34 and her eldest daughter Lynda. In foreign governments,
the university has been represented by Fernando Bela√∫nde Terry '36 (42nd
President of Peru), Mostafa Chamran (former Minister of Defense for Iran), and
Abdullah al-Tariki (co-founder of OPEC). Additionally, the Prime Minister of
the Palestinian National Authority, Salam Fayyad, graduated from the university
with a PhD in economics. Alumni in academia include the 26th President of The
College of William & Mary Gene Nichol '76, the 10th President of Boston
University Robert A. Brown '73 & '75, and the 8th President of the University
of Southern California John R. Hubbard. The University also graduated Alan Bean
'55, the fourth man to walk on the Moon. Additionally, alumni who have served
as business leaders include ExxonMobil Corporation CEO Rex Tillerson '75, Dell
founder and CEO Michael Dell, and Gary C. Kelly, Southwest Airlines's CEO. In
literature and journalism, the school has produced Pulitzer Prize winners Gail
Caldwell and Ben Sargent '70. Walter Cronkite, the former CBS Evening News
anchor once called the most trusted man in America, attended the University of
Texas at Austin, as did CNN anchor Betty Nguyen '95. Alumnus J. M. Coetzee also
received the 2003 Nobel Prize in Literature. Novelist Raymond Benson ('78) was
the official author of James Bond novels between 1996‚Äì2002, the only American
to be commissioned to pen them. Donna Alvermann, a distinguished research
professor at the University of Georgia, Department of Education also graduated
from the University of Texas, as did Wallace Clift ('49) and Jean Dalby Clift
('50, J.D. '52), authors of several books in the fields of psychology of
religion and spiritual growth. Alireza Jafarzadeh the author of "The Iran
