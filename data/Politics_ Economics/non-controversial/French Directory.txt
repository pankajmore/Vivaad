French Directory The Directory () was a body of five "Directors" that held
executive power in France following the Convention and preceding the Consulate.
The period of this regime (2 November 1795 until 10 November 1799), commonly
known as the Directory (or Directoire) era, constitutes the second to last
stage of the French Revolution. The Directory era itself is further split into
two eras, the First Directory and the Second Directory, divided by the Coup of
18 Fructidor. Directoire style refers to the Neoclassical styles in the
decorative arts and fashion that characterize the period. The directory system
of government was also used in several French client republics and modern
Switzerland; see directorial system. Constitution of Year III. Under the French
Constitution of 1795, qualified property holders elected 750 legislators, who
divided themselves into the Council of Five Hundred and the Council of
Ancients. This bicameral legislature had a term of three years, with one-third
of the members renewed every year. The Ancients held a suspensory veto, but
possessed no initiative in legislation. The constitution specified the
executive as consisting of five directors, chosen by the Ancients out of a list
sent to them by the Five Hundred. One director faced retirement each year.
Ministers for the various departments of State aided the directors. These
ministers did not form a council or cabinet and had no general powers of
government. The system made provision for the stringent control of all local
authorities by the central government. Since the new constitution sought to
create a separation of powers, the directors had no voice in legislation or
taxation, nor could directors or ministers sit in either house. The law
guaranteed freedom of religion, freedom of the press, and freedom of labour,
but forbade armed assemblies and even public meetings of political societies.
Only individuals or public authorities could tender petitions. From the
beginning, however, circumstances restricted the free play of the constitution.
The Convention had acquired so much unpopularity that, if its members had
retired into private life, they would have courted danger and risked the
undoing of their work. Therefore a decree required that two-thirds of the first
legislature must come from among the members of the Convention. When the
constitution went before the primary assemblies, most electors held aloof,
voting for and voting against it. On 23 September it officially became law.
Then all the parties which resented the limit upon freedom of election combined
in Paris to rise in revolt. The government entrusted its defense to Barras, but
on 13 Vend√©miaire (5 October 1795) the young General Napol√©on Bonaparte
quelled ill-equipped and ill-led Parisian insurgents with a few thousand
regular troops and well-placed artillery. Further resistance seemed impossible.
The Convention dissolved itself on 26 October 1795. After the selection of the
Council of the Ancients by lot, it remained to name the directors. For its own
security the Left resolved that all five must be old members of the Convention
and regicides. The Ancients chose Rewbell, Barras and La R√©velli√®re L√©peaux
had a full measure of the Jacobin spirit; Carnot and Le Tourneur favoured a
more temperate policy. Unpopularity of the Directory. With the establishment of
the Directory, the Revolution seemed on the verge of ending. The nation was
tired of the violence of the Terror and needed time to recover. Those who
wished to restore Louis XVIII of France and the "Ancien R√©gime" and those who
would have renewed the Reign of Terror were insignificant in number. The
possibility of foreign interference had vanished with the failure of the First
Coalition. Nevertheless, the four years of the Directory were a time of chronic
disquiet and the late atrocities had made goodwill between parties impossible.
The same instinct of self-preservation which had led the members of the
Convention to claim so large a part in the new legislature and the whole of the
Directory impelled them to keep their predominance. As the majority of
Frenchmen wanted to be rid of them, they could achieve their purpose only by
extraordinary means. They disregarded the terms of the constitution, and, when
the elections went against them, they prolonged the war to stay in power. They
were thus driven to rely upon the armies, which also desired war and were
becoming less and less civic in temper. Other reasons influenced them in this
direction. The finances had been so thoroughly ruined that the government could
not have met its expenses without the plunder and the tribute of foreign
countries. If peace were made, the armies would return home and the directors
would have to face the exasperation of the rank-and-file who had lost their
livelihood, as well as the ambition of generals who could, in a moment, brush
them aside. Barras and Rewbell were notoriously corrupt themselves and screened
corruption in others. The patronage of the directors was ill-bestowed, and the
general maladministration heightened their unpopularity. The constitutional
party in the legislature desired toleration of the nonjuring clergy, the repeal
of the laws against the relatives of the √©migr√©s, and some merciful
discrimination toward the √©migr√©s themselves. The directors baffled all such
endeavours. On the other hand, the socialist conspiracy of Babeuf was easily
quelled. Little was done to improve the finances, and the assignats continued.
Military successes. However, the Directory was sustained by the military
successes of 1796. Hoche again suppressed the Revolt in the Vend√©e.
Bonaparte's victories in Italy more than compensated for the reverses of
Jourdan and Moreau in Germany. The king of Sardinia made peace in May 1796,
ceding Nice and Savoy to the French Republic and consenting to receive French
garrisons in his Piedmontese fortresses. By the Treaty of San Ildefonso,
concluded in August, Spain became the ally of France. In October 1796, the
Kingdom of Naples made peace. In 1797, Bonaparte finished the conquest of
northern Italy and forced Austria to make the Treaty of Campo Formio (October),
whereby the emperor ceded Lombardy and the Austrian Netherlands to the French
Republic in exchange for Venice and undertook to urge upon the Diet the
surrender of the lands beyond the Rhine. Notwithstanding the victory of Cape St
Vincent, the United Kingdom was brought into such extreme peril by the mutinies
in its fleet that it offered to acknowledge the French conquest of the
Netherlands and to restore the French colonies. The selfishness of the three
Directors threw away this golden opportunity. In March and April, the election
of a new third of the Councils had been held. It gave a majority to the
constitutional party. Among the directors, the lot fell on Le Tourneur to
retire, and he was succeeded by Barth√©lemy, an eminent diplomatist, who allied
himself with Carnot. The political disabilities imposed upon the relatives of
√©migr√©s were repealed. Priests who would declare their submission to the
Republic were restored to their rights as citizens. It seemed likely that peace
would be made and that moderate men would gain power. 18 Fructidor. Barras,
Rewbell, and La R√©velli√®re-L√©peaux then sought help from the armies.
Although Royalists formed but a petty fraction of the majority, they accused
that fraction of seeking to restore monarchy and to undo the work of the
Revolution. Hoche, then in command of the Army of Sambre-et-Meuse, visited
Paris and sent troops. Bonaparte sent General Augereau, who executed the "coup
d'√©tat" of 18 Fructidor (4 September 1797). The councils were purged, the
elections in forty-nine departments were cancelled, and many deputies and other
men of note were arrested. Some of them, including Barth√©lemy, Pichegru,
Barb√©-Marbois and Laffon de Ladebat were deported to Cayenne. Carnot made good
his escape. The two vacant places in the Directory were filled by Merlin de
Douai and Nicolas-Louis Fran√ßois de Neufch√¢teau. Then the government frankly
returned to Jacobin methods. The law against the relatives of "√©migr√©s" was
reenacted, and military tribunals were established to condemn "√©migr√©s" who
should return to France. The nonjuring priests were again persecuted. Many
hundreds were either sent to Cayenne or imprisoned in the hulks of R√© and
Ol√©ron. La R√©velli√®re L√©peaux seized the opportunity to propagate his
religion. Many churches were turned into Theophilanthropic temples. The
government strained its power to secure the recognition of the "d√©cadi" as the
day of public worship and the non-observance of Sunday. Liberty of the press
ceased. Newspapers were confiscated and journalists were deported wholesale. It
was proposed to banish from France all members of the old "noblesse". Although
the proposal was dropped, they were all declared to be foreigners and were
forced to obtain naturalisation if they would enjoy the rights of other
citizens. A formal bankruptcy of the state, the cancelling of two-thirds of the
interest on the public debt, crowned the misgovernment of this disastrous time.
1798. In the spring of 1798, not only a new third of the legislature had to be
chosen, but the places of the members expelled by the revolution of Fructidor
had to be filled. The constitutional party had been rendered helpless, and the
mass of the electors were indifferent. However, among the Jacobins themselves,
there had arisen an extreme party hostile to the directors. With the support of
many who were not Jacobins but detested the government, it bade fair to gain a
majority. Before the new deputies could take their seats, the directors forced
through the councils the law of 22 Flor√©al, annulling or perverting the
elections in thirty departments and excluding forty-eight deputies by name.
Even this "coup d'√©tat" did not secure harmony between the executive and the
legislature. In the councils, the directors were loudly charged with corruption
and misgovernment. The retirement of Fran√ßois de Neufch√¢teau and the choice
of Treilhard as his successor (15 May 1798) made no difference in the position
of the Directory. While France was thus inwardly convulsed, its rulers were
doubly bound to husband the national strength and practise moderation towards
other states. Since December 1797, a congress had been sitting at Rastatt to
regulate the future of Germany. That it should be brought to a successful
conclusion was of the utmost importance for France. However, the directors were
driven by self-interest to new adventures abroad. Bonaparte was resolved not to
sink into obscurity, and the directors were anxious to keep him as far as
possible from Paris. They, therefore, sanctioned the expedition to Egypt which
deprived the Republic of its best army and most renowned captain. Coveting the
treasures of Bern, the Directors sent Brune to invade Switzerland and remodel
its constitution. In revenge for the murder of General Duphot (28 December
1797), they sent Berthier to invade the Papal States and erect the Roman
Republic. They also occupied and virtually annexed Piedmont. In all these
countries, they organised such an effective pillage that the French became
universally hated. As the armies were far below the strength required by the
policy of unbounded conquest and rapine, the first permanent law of
conscription was passed in the summer of 1798. The attempt to enforce it caused
a revolt of the peasants in the Belgian departments. The priests were held
responsible and some eight thousand were condemned to deportation "en masse",
although the much greater part escaped by the goodwill of the people. Few
soldiers were obtained by the conscription, for the government was as weak as
it was tyrannical. Under these circumstances, Horatio Nelson's victory of
Aboukir (1 August 1798), which gave the British full command of the
Mediterranean and isolated Bonaparte in Egypt, was the signal for a second
coalition. Naples, Austria, Russia and Turkey joined Great Britain against
France. Ferdinand IV of Naples, rashly taking the offensive before his allies
were ready, was defeated and forced to seek a refuge in Sicily. 1799. In
January 1799, the French occupied Naples along with Togar and set up the
Parthenopaean Republic. But the consequent dispersion of their weak forces only
exposed them to greater peril. At home, the Directory was in a most critical
position. In the elections of April 1799, a large number of Jacobins gained
seats. A little later Rewbell retired. It was imperative to fill his place with
a man of ability and influence. The choice fell upon Siey√®s, who had kept
aloof from office and retained not only his immeasurable self-conceit but the
respect of the public. Siey√®s felt that the Directory had bankrupted its own
reputation, and he intended to do far more than merely serve as a member of a
board. He hoped to concentrate power in his own hands, to bridle the Jacobins,
and to remodel the constitution. With the help of Barras, he proceeded to rid
himself of the other directors. An irregularity having emerged in Treilhard's
election, he retired, and Gohier took his place (30 Prairial, 18 June 1799).
Merlin de Douai and La R√©velli√®re L√©peaux were driven to resign in June
1799; Moulin and Ducos replaced them. The three new directors so lacked
significance that they could give no trouble, but for the same reason they
could give little service. Such a government proved ill-fitted to cope with the
dangers then gathering round France. The directors resolved on a French
offensive in Germany. The French crossed the Rhine early in March, but Archduke
Charles of Austria defeated them, first at Ostrach on 23¬ March and then at
Stockach on 25 March 1799. Jourdan's Army of the Danube withdrew to the Rhine
under the command of Lecourbe, while Jourdan himself returned to Paris to plea
for more and better soldiers. The congress at Rastatt, which had sat for
fifteen months without actually accomplishing anything, broke in April, and
Austrian hussars murdered the French envoys. In Italy, the allies took the
offensive with an army partly Austrian, partly Russian, under the command of
the Russian field marshal (future generalissimo) Suvorov. After defeating
Moreau at Cassano d'Adda on 27 April 1799, he occupied Milan and Turin. The
puppet republics established by the French in Italy collapsed, and Suvorov
defeated the French army on the Trebbia as it retreated from Naples. Thus
threatened with invasion on her German and Italian frontiers, France seemed
disabled by anarchy within. The finances stood in the last distress; the anti-
religious policy of the government kept many "d√©partements" on the verge of
revolt; and commerce almost ground to a halt due to the decay of roads and the
increase of bandits. The French lacked any real political freedom, yet also
lacked the ease or security which enlightened despotism can bestow. The
Terrorists lifted their heads in the Council of Five Hundred. A Law of
Hostages, which was really a new Law of Suspects, and a progressive income tax
showed the temper of the majority. The Jacobin Club re-opened and became once
more the focus of disorder. The Jacobin press renewed the licence of H√©bert
and Marat. Never since the outbreak of the Revolution had the public temper
seemed so gloomy. In this extremity, Siey√®s chose as minister of police the
old Terrorist Joseph Fouch√©, who best understood how to deal with his
brethren. Fouch√© closed the Jacobin Club and deported a number of journalists.
However, like his predecessors, Siey√®s felt that for the revolution which he
meditated, he must have the help of a soldier. As his man of action, he chose
General Joubert, one of the most distinguished among French officers. The
Directory sent Joubert to restore the fortunes of the war in Italy. At Novi, on
15 August 1799, he encountered Suvorov. He was killed at the outset of the
battle and his men suffered defeat. After this disaster, the French held
scarcely any territory south of the Alps save Genoa. The Russian and Austrian
governments then agreed to drive the enemy out of Switzerland and to invade
France from the east. At the same time, the joint forces of Great Britain and
Russia assailed the Netherlands. However, the narrow views and conflicting
interests of the members of the second coalition doomed it to failure like the
first. Lack of co-ordination between Austrians and Russians, and Andr√©
Mass√©na's victory at Z√ºrich (25‚Äì26 September 1799) stalled the invasion of
Switzerland. In October, the British and the Russians had to evacuate the
Netherlands. All immediate danger to France ended, but the issue of war
remained in suspense. The Directors had felt forced to recall Bonaparte from
Egypt. He anticipated their order and on 9 October 1799 landed at Fr√©jus. End
of the Directory. The Directory and the French Revolution itself came to an end
with the "coup d'√©tat" of 18 Brumaire (9 November 1799) in which General
Napol√©on Bonaparte overthrew the Directory and replaced it with the Consulate.
In November 1799, France was suffering the effects of military reverses brought
on by Bonaparte's adventurism in the Middle East. The looming threat of
opportunistic invasion by the Second Coalition had provoked internal unrest,
with Bonaparte stuck in Egypt. A return to Jacobinism seemed possible. The coup
was first prepared by the Abb√© Siey√®s, then one of the five Directors.
Bonaparte returned from Egypt a hero to the public despite his reverses.
Siey√®s believed he had found the general indispensable to his coup. However,
Bonaparte promptly began a coup within the coup. Ultimately, the coup brought
to power Bonaparte, not Siey√®s. The plan was, through the use of troops
conveniently arrayed around Paris, first to persuade the Directors to resign,
then to persuade the two Councils to appoint a pliant commission to draw up a
new constitution. On the morning of 18 Brumaire, members of the Council of
Ancients sympathetic to the coup warned their colleagues of a Jacobin
conspiracy and persuaded them to relocate to Saint-Cloud, west of Paris.
Bonaparte was charged with the safety of the two Councils. Three directors,
including Siey√®s himself resigned, destroying quorum. However, the two Jacobin
Directors, Gohier and Moulin, refused to resign. Moulin escaped, Gohier was
taken prisoner, and the two Councils were not immediately intimidated and
continued to meet. By the following day, the deputies had worked out that they
were facing an attempted coup rather than being protected from a Jacobin
rebellion. Faced with their recalcitrance, Bonaparte stormed into the chambers
accompanied by a small escort of grenadiers. He met with heckling in both
houses; he was first jostled, then outright assaulted. His brother Lucien,
President of the Council, called upon the grenadiers to defend their leader.
Napoleon escaped, but only through the use of military force. Ultimately,
military force also dispersed the legislature. The Consulate was declared, with
Bonaparte, Siey√®s, and Roger Ducos as consuls. The lack of reaction from the
streets proved that the revolution was, indeed, over. In the words of the 1911
Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, "A shabby compound of brute force and imposture, the
18th Brumaire was nevertheless condoned, nay applauded, by the French nation.
Weary of revolution, men sought no more than to be wisely and firmly governed."
Resistance by Jacobin officeholders in the provinces was quickly crushed,
twenty Jacobin legislators were exiled, and others were arrested. Bonaparte
completed his "coup" within a "coup" by the adoption of a constitution under
which the First Consul, a position he was sure to hold, had greater power than
the other two.
