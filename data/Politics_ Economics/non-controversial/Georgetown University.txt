Georgetown University Georgetown University is a private research university in
Washington, D.C. Founded in 1789, it is the oldest Jesuit and Catholic
university in the United States. Georgetown's main campus, located in
Washington's Georgetown neighborhood, is noted for Healy Hall, a National
Historic Landmark in the Romanesque revival style. Georgetown operates a law
center on Capitol Hill and auxiliary campuses in Italy, Turkey, and Qatar.
Georgetown's founding by John Carroll, America's first Catholic bishop,
realized efforts to establish a Roman Catholic college in the province of
Maryland that were repeatedly thwarted by religious persecution. The university
expanded after the American Civil War under the leadership of Patrick Francis
Healy, who came to be known as Georgetown's "second founder" despite having
been born a slave. Jesuits have participated in the university's administration
since 1805, a heritage Georgetown celebrates, but the university has always
been governed independently of the Society of Jesus and of church authorities.
The university has around 7,000 undergraduate and over 8,000 post-graduate
students from a wide variety of religious, ethnic, and geographic backgrounds,
including 130 foreign countries. The university's most notable alumni are
prominent in public life in the United States and abroad. Among them are former
U.S. President Bill Clinton, U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonin
Scalia, dozens of U.S. governors and members of Congress, heads of state or
government of more than a dozen countries, royalty and diplomats. Campus
organizations include the country's oldest student theater group and largest
student-run business. Georgetown's athletic teams, called the Hoyas, include a
men's basketball team that has won a record-tying seven Big East championships,
appeared in five Final Fours, and won a national championship in 1984. History.
Founding. Jesuit settlers from England founded the Province of Maryland in
1634. However, the 1646 defeat of the Royalists in the English Civil War led to
stringent laws against Roman Catholic education and the extradition of known
Jesuits from the colony, including Andrew White, and the destruction of their
school at Calverton Manor. During most of the remainder of Maryland's colonial
period, Jesuits conducted Catholic schools clandestinely. It was not until
after the end of the American Revolution that plans to establish a permanent
Catholic institution for education in the United States were realized. Because
of Benjamin Franklin's recommendation, Pope Pius VI appointed former Jesuit
John Carroll as the first head of the Roman Catholic Church in America, even
though the papal suppression of the Jesuit order was still in effect. Carroll
began meetings of local clergy in 1783 near Annapolis, Maryland, where they
orchestrated the development of a new university. On January 23, 1789, Carroll
finalized the purchase of the property on which Dahlgren Quadrangle was later
built. Future Congressman William Gaston was enrolled as the school's first
student on November 22, 1791, and instruction began on January 2, 1792. During
its early years, Georgetown College suffered from considerable financial
strain, relying on private sources of funding and the limited profits from
local lands owned by ex-Jesuits. The Maryland Society of Jesus began its
restoration in 1805, and Jesuit affiliation, in the form of teachers and
administrators, bolstered confidence in the college. The United States Congress
issued Georgetown the first federal university charter in 1815, which allowed
it to confer degrees, and the first Bachelor degrees were awarded two years
later. In 1844, the school received a corporate charter, under the name "The
President and Directors of Georgetown College", affording the growing school
additional legal rights. In response to the demand for a local option for Roman
Catholic students, the Medical School was founded in 1851. Civil War. The U.S.
Civil War greatly affected Georgetown as 1,141¬ students and alumni enlisted
and the Union Army commandeered university buildings. By the time of President
Abraham Lincoln's May 1861 visit to campus, 1,400¬ troops were stationed in
temporary quarters there. Due to the number of lives lost, enrollment levels
remained low until well after the war was over. Only seven students graduated
in 1869, down from over 300 in the previous decade. Lincoln assassination
conspirator, David Herold attended Georgetown from 1855 through 1858 and
received a certificate in pharmacology in 1860. At its founding in 1876, the
Georgetown College Boat Club, the school's rowing team, adopted blue, used for
Union uniforms, and gray, used for Confederate uniforms, as its colors to
signify the peaceful unity among students. Subsequently, the school adopted
these as its official colors. Enrollment did not recover from the war until the
presidency of Patrick Francis Healy from 1873 to 1881. Born a slave by law,
Healy was the first acknowledged head of a predominantly white American
university with African heritage. He is credited with reforming the
undergraduate curriculum, lengthening the medical and law programs, and
creating the Alumni Association. One of his largest undertakings was the
construction of a major new building, subsequently named Healy Hall in his
honor. For his work, Healy is known as the school's "second founder."
Expansion. After the founding of the Law Department in 1870, Healy and his
successors hoped to bind the professional schools into a university, and focus
on higher education. The School of Medicine added a dental school in 1901 and
the undergraduate School of Nursing in 1903. Georgetown Preparatory School
relocated from campus in 1919 and fully separated from the University in 1927.
The School of Foreign Service (SFS) was founded in 1919 by Edmund A. Walsh, to
prepare students for leadership in foreign commerce and diplomacy. The School
of Business was created out of the SFS in 1957, and in 1998 was renamed the
McDonough School of Business in honor of alumnus Robert E. McDonough. Besides
expansion of the University, Georgetown also aimed to expand their resources
and their student body. The School of Nursing has admitted female students
since its founding, and most of the university was made available on a limited
basis by 1952. With the College of Arts and Sciences welcoming its first female
students in the 1969‚Äì1970 academic year, Georgetown became fully
coeducational. Georgetown ended its bicentennial year of 1989 by electing Leo
J. O'Donovan as president. He subsequently launched the Third Century Campaign
to build the school's endowment. In December 2003, Georgetown completed the
campaign after raising over $1¬ billion for financial aid, academic chair
endowment, and new capital projects. John J. DeGioia, Georgetown's first lay
president, has led the school since 2001, and has continued its financial
modernization and sought to "expand opportunities for intercultural and
interreligious dialogue", such as by opening a campus in Qatar. Jesuit
tradition. Georgetown University was founded by former Jesuits in the tradition
of Ignatius of Loyola and is a member of the Association of Jesuit Colleges and
Universities. Georgetown is not a pontifical university, though three Jesuits
serve on the forty member Board of Directors, the school's highest governance.
Fifty-nine members of the Society of Jesus live on campus, and are mostly
employed by Georgetown as professors or administrators. Jesuit Heritage Week
has been held every year since 2001 to celebrate the contributions of Jesuits
to the Georgetown tradition. The role that Georgetown's Catholic heritage has
played in its policies has been controversial at times, even as its influence
is relatively limited. Stores in University-owned buildings are not allowed to
sell or distribute birth control products. Georgetown University Medical Center
and Georgetown University Hospital, operated by MedStar Health, are prohibited
from performing abortions. As recently as 2004, the hospital did perform
research using embryonic stem cells. Georgetown has drawn criticism from
religious groups such as the Cardinal Newman Society for hosting speeches from
prominent pro-choice politicians, including John Kerry and Barack Obama, and
from Washington's Archbishop, Donald Wuerl, for inviting Kathleen Sebelius to
be a commencement speaker. The university does host the Cardinal O'Connor
Conference on Life every January to discuss the pro-life movement. Between 1996
and 1999, crucifixes were added to many classroom walls, attracting national
attention. Before 1996, crucifixes had hung only in hospital rooms and historic
classrooms. Some of these crucifixes are historic works of art, and are noted
as such. According to Imam Yahya Hendi, the school's on-campus Muslim cleric,
pressure to remove the crucifixes comes from within the Catholic community,
while he and other campus faith leaders have defended their placement. The
Intercultural Center is an exception to this controversy, rotating displays of
various faith and culture symbols in the lobby. Academics. , the University has
7,553¬ undergraduate students, and 5,832¬ graduate students. Bachelor's
programs are offered through Georgetown College, the School of Nursing and
Health Studies, the Robert Emmett McDonough School of Business, the School of
Continuing Studies, and the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service, which
includes the Qatar campus. Some high school students from Georgetown Visitation
are permitted to attend classes for Advanced Placement credit. Georgetown
University offers undergraduate degrees in forty-eight majors in the four
undergraduate schools, as well as the opportunity for students to design their
own individualized courses of study. All majors in the College are open as
minors to students in the College, the School of Nursing and Health Studies,
and the School of Business. Students in the School of Foreign Service cannot
receive minors, but can complete certificates instead. All courses are on a
credit hour system. Georgetown offers many opportunities to study abroad, and
58.7% of the undergraduate student body spends time at an institution overseas.
Master's and doctoral programs are offered through the Graduate School of Arts
and Sciences, the Law Center, the School of Medicine, and the School of
Continuing Studies. The McDonough School of Business and the Edmund A. Walsh
School of Foreign Service both offer masters programs. The Center for
Contemporary Arab Studies and the Public Policy Institute are both research
centers which also offer masters degrees. Masters students occasionally share
some advanced seminars with undergraduates, and most undergraduate schools
offer abbreviated bachelors and masters programs following completion of the
undergraduate degree. Each graduate school offers at least one double degree
with another graduate school. Additionally, the Law Center offers a joint
degree with the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. The School of
Continuing Studies includes the Center for Continuing and Professional
Education, and operates four types of degree programs, over thirty professional
certificates and non-degree courses, undergraduate and graduate degrees in
Liberal Studies, as well as summer courses for graduates, undergraduates, and
high school students. Faculty. , Georgetown University employed 1,291¬ full-
time and 882¬ part-time faculty members across its three Washington, D.C.
campuses, with additional staff at SFS-Qatar. The faculty comprises leading
academics and notable political and business leaders, and are predominantly
male by a two-to-one margin. Politically, Georgetown University's faculty
members give more support to liberal candidates, and while their donation
patterns are generally consistent with those of other American university
faculties, they gave more than average to Barack Obama's presidential campaign.
The current faculty includes scholars such as the former President of the
American Philological Association James J. O'Donnell, theologian John Haught,
political theorist James V. Schall, social activists Sam Marullo and Chai
Feldblum, and preeminent hip-hop scholar Michael Eric Dyson. Many former
politicians choose to teach at Georgetown, including the former Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, U.S. Agency for International Development
administrator Andrew Natsios, National Security Advisor Anthony Lake, and CIA
director George Tenet. Internationally, the school attracts numerous former
ambassadors and heads of state, such as Saudi Ambassador Prince Turki bin
Faisal Al Saud, Prime Minister of Spain Jos√© Mar√≠a Aznar, and President of
Colombia √Ålvaro Uribe. Research. Georgetown University is a self-described
"student-centered research university" considered by the Carnegie
Classification of Institutions of Higher Education to have "very high research
activity". , Georgetown's libraries held 2,778,526¬ printed items and
73,496¬ serials in seven buildings, with most in Lauinger Library. The Blommer
Science Library, located in the Reiss Science Building on campus, houses most
of the Science collection. Additionally, the Law School campus includes the
nation's fifth largest law library. Georgetown faculty conduct research in
hundreds of subjects, but have priorities in the fields of religion, ethics,
science, public policy, and cancer medicine. Cross-institutional research is
performed with Columbia University and Virginia Tech. In 2008, Georgetown spent
$143 million on research, ranking it 111th nationwide. In 2007, it received
about $14.8 million in federal funds for research, with 64% from the National
Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, the United States Department
of Energy, and the Department of Defense. In 2010, the school received $5.6
million from the Department of Education to fund fellowships in several
international studies fields. Georgetown University Medical Center received an
additional $118.4 million from these and other government sources. Georgetown's
Vincent Lombardi Cancer Center is one of 41 research-intensive comprehensive
cancer centers in the United States, and developed the breakthrough HPV vaccine
for cervical cancer in 2006. Centers which conduct and sponsor research at
Georgetown include the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs,
the Prince Alwaleed Center for Muslim‚ÄìChristian Understanding and the
Woodstock Theological Center. Regular publications include the "Georgetown
Journal on Poverty Law and Policy", the "Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal",
the "Georgetown Law Journal", the "Georgetown Journal of International
Affairs", and the "Georgetown Public Policy Review". Admissions. With over
20,100 applications and 3,316 admitted for the class of 2016, Georgetown has an
overall undergraduate acceptance rate of 16%, their lowest ever. "The Fiske
Guide to Colleges" states that "only Stanford and a handful of Ivy League
schools are tougher to get into than Georgetown." , Georgetown's graduate
schools have acceptance rates of 3.6% to the School of Medicine, 19% to the Law
Center, 25% to the MSFS, and 34.9% to the MBA program. In 2004, a National
Bureau of Economic Research study on revealed preference of U.S. colleges
showed that Georgetown was the 16th most-preferred choice. The undergraduate
schools maintain a restrictive Early Action admissions program, as students who
have applied through an Early Decision process at another school are not
permitted to apply early to Georgetown. 94% of students accepted for the class
of 2014 were in the top 10% of their class and had SAT scores ranging from
660‚Äì760 in Critical Reading, and 670‚Äì770 in Math. Georgetown accepts both
the SAT and ACT, though does not consider the writing portion of either. Over
55% of undergraduates receive financial aid, and the university meets 100% of
demonstrated need, with an average financial aid package of $23,500 and about
70% of aid distributed in the forms of grants or scholarships. Campuses.
Georgetown University has three campuses in Washington, D.C.: the undergraduate
campus, the Medical Center, and the Law Center. The undergraduate campus and
Medical Center are together in the Georgetown neighborhood and form the main
campus. Other centers are located around Washington, D.C., including the Center
for Continuing and Professional Education at Clarendon in Arlington, Virginia.
Transit between these locations and the Washington Metro is supplied by a
system of shuttles, known as GUTS buses. Georgetown also operates a facility in
Doha, Qatar, and villas in Alanya, Turkey and Fiesole, Italy. In their campus
layout, Georgetown's administrators consistently used the traditional
quadrangle design. Main campus. Georgetown University's undergraduate campus
and medical school campus are situated on an elevated site above the Potomac
River, overlooking Northern Virginia. The main gates, known as the "Healy
Gates", are located at the intersection of 37th and O Streets, NW. The main
campus is just over in area and includes fifty-four buildings, student
residences capable of accommodating 80% of undergraduates, and various athletic
facilities. Most buildings employ collegiate Gothic architecture and Georgian
brick architecture. Campus green areas include fountains, a cemetery, large
clusters of flowers, groves of trees, and open quadrangles. Georgetown received
a B grade on the 2011 College Sustainability Report Card, and new buildings and
major renovations are required to meet LEED Sliver criteria. The main campus
has traditionally centered on Dahlgren Quadrangle, although Red Square has
replaced it as the focus of student life. Healy Hall, built in Flemish
Romanesque style from 1877 to 1879, is the architectural gem of Georgetown's
campus, and is a National Historic Landmark. Both Healy Hall and the Georgetown
University Astronomical Observatory, built in 1844, are listed on the National
Register of Historic Places. The medical school is on the northwestern part of
the main campus on Reservoir Road, and is integrated with Georgetown University
Hospital. The school uses many of the townhouses in the Georgetown neighborhood
east of the main campus for upperclassmen housing, institutions, and alumni
facilities. Additionally, the Walsh School of Foreign Service and the Graduate
School of Arts and Sciences both have classroom buildings in this area.
Georgetown Visitation, a private Roman Catholic girls high school, is northeast
of campus, on land adjoining the undergraduate campus. In late 2003, the
university completed the Southwest Quadrangle Project, and brought a new 907-
bed student dorm, an expansive dining hall, an underground parking facility,
and new Jesuit Residence to the campus. The school's first performing arts
center, named for Royden B. Davis, was completed in November 2005, and the new
business school building, named for Rafik Hariri, opened in Fall 2009. Future
construction plans include a unified sciences center and expanded athletic
facilities. As a location, Georgetown is ranked nationally as the second best
college town by the "Princeton Review". Despite this, main campus "town and
gown" relations are often strained by facilities construction, enlargement of
the student body, as well as noise and alcohol violations. Crime is also a
persistent issue, with campus security responding to 257 crimes in 2008. Law
Center campus. The Law Center campus is located in the Capitol Hill
neighborhood on New Jersey Avenue, near Union Station and consists of five
buildings. First-year students at the Law Center can live in the single on-
campus dormitory, the Gewirz Student Center. Most second- and third-year
students, as well as some first-year students, live off-campus. As there is
little housing near the Law Center, most are spread throughout the Washington
metropolitan area. The "Campus Completion Project", finished in 2005, saw the
addition of the Hotung International Building and the Sport and Fitness Center.
G Street and F Street are closed off between 1st and 2nd Streets to create open
lawns flanking McDonough Hall, the main building on the campus. Facilities
abroad. In December 1979, the Marquesa Margaret Rockefeller de Larrain,
granddaughter of John D. Rockefeller, gave the Villa Le Balze to Georgetown
University. The Villa is in Fiesole, Italy, on a hill above the city of
Florence. The Villa is used year-round for study abroad programs focused on
specialized interdisciplinary study of Italian culture and civilization. The
main facility for the McGhee Center for Eastern Mediterranean Studies was
donated to Georgetown in 1989 by alumnus and former United States Ambassador to
Turkey George C. McGhee. The school is in the town of Alanya, Turkey within the
Seljuq-era Alanya Castle, on the Mediterranean. The Center operates study
abroad programs one semester each year, concentrating on Turkish language,
architectural history, and Islamic studies. In 2002, the Qatar Foundation for
Education, Science and Community Development presented the School of Foreign
Service with the resources and space to open a facility in the new Education
City in Doha, Qatar. SFS-Qatar opened in 2005 as a liberal arts and
international affairs undergraduate school for regional students. In December
2007, Georgetown opened a liaison office in Shanghai, China to coordinate with
Fudan University and others. In 2008, the Georgetown University Law Center in
conjunction with an international consortium of law schools established the
Center for Transnational Legal Studies in London, England. Student life. The
Georgetown undergraduate student body, at 7,553 , is composed primarily of
students from outside the District of Columbia area, with 34% of new 2010
students coming from Mid-Atlantic states, 11% being international students and
the remainder coming from other areas of the US. The student body also
represented 129 different countries, with 9% being international, including
over 330 undergraduate and 1,050 graduate students who chose to come to
Georgetown as a study abroad destination in 2009‚Äì10. As of that year, the
racial diversity of the undergraduate student body was 62.3% white, 8.8% Asian,
6.3% black, and 5.9% Hispanic; Additionally, 55.2% of undergraduates are
female. Although it is a Jesuit university, only 41% of the student body
identify as Roman Catholic, while 22% identify as Protestant . Georgetown
employs a full-time rabbi, as 6.5% of undergraduates are Jewish. It was the
first U.S. college to have a full-time imam, to serve the over four-hundred
Muslims on campus. Georgetown also sponsors student groups for Bah√°'i,
Buddhist, Hindu, and Mormon traditions. The student body consists of both
religious and irreligious students, and more than four-hundred freshmen and
transfer students attend a nonreligious Ignatian retreat annually, called
ESCAPE. A 2007 survey of undergraduates also suggests that 62.8% are sexually
active, while 6.2% identify as LGBTQ. Discrimination can be an issue on campus,
and three-fourths of a 2009 survey considered homophobia a campus problem.
"Newsweek", however, rated Georgetown among its top "Gay-Friendly Schools" in
2010. In 2011, "College Magazine" ranked Georgetown as the tenth most hipster
U.S. college, while People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals considered it
the third most vegan friendly small U.S. school. Almost all undergraduates
attend full-time. A majority of undergraduates, 76%, live on-campus in several
dormitories and apartment complexes, including all underclassmen. , 1255
undergraduates and 339 graduate students live off-campus, mostly in the
Georgetown, Glover Park, Burleith, and Foxhall neighborhoods. Although many of
the University's hall directors and area coordinators attend graduate level
courses, on-campus housing is not available for main campus graduate students.
The school hopes to build such housing by 2020. All students in the Medical
School live off-campus, most in the surrounding neighborhoods, with some in
Northern Virginia and elsewhere through the region. Student groups. , 92.89% of
Georgetown University undergraduates are involved in at least one of the
179¬ registered student organizations which cover a variety of interests:
student government, club sports, media and publications, performing arts,
religion, and volunteer and service. Students also operate campus stores,
banks, and medical services. Students often find their interests at the Student
Activities Commission Club Fair, where both official and unofficial
organizations set up tables. The Georgetown University Student Association is
the student government organization for undergraduates. There are also student
representatives within the schools, to the Board of Directors, and, since 1996,
to the Georgetown Advisory Neighborhood Commission. Georgetown's student
organizations include one of the nation's oldest debating clubs, the Philodemic
Society, founded in 1830, and the oldest university theater group, the Mask and
Bauble Dramatic Society. Nomadic Theatre, founded in 1982 as an alternative
troupe without an on-campus home, produces "plays which educate and challenge
all members of the university community through thought-provoking theatre." The
Georgetown Improv Association, founded in 1995, performs monthly long-form
improvisational shows on-campus at Bulldog Alley in addition to hosting
"Improvfest", one of the oldest improv festivals in the country. There are a
total of seven "a cappella" groups on campus, including The Georgetown Chimes,
the Phantoms, Superfood, The GraceNotes, the Chamber Singers, Essence, Harmony,
the service-oriented Saxatones, and the all-male Capitol G's. These groups
perform annually at the "D.C. A Cappella Festival", held since 1991, and the
"Cherry Tree Massacre" concert series, held since 1974. The Georgetown
University Band is composed of the Georgetown Pep Band and the Georgetown Wind
Ensemble, and performs on campus, in Washington, D.C., and at post-season
basketball tournaments. In addition to student organizations and clubs,
Georgetown University is home to the nation's largest entirely student-owned
and¬ -operated corporation, Students of Georgetown, Inc. Founded in 1972, "The
Corp" operates three coffee shops and two grocery stores, and runs storage and
airport shuttles for students. The business has annual revenues of over $1.3
million, which are directly re-invested into the Georgetown student body
through Corp Philanthropy, which gave out over $50,000 in scholarships and
donations to Georgetown groups in 2010‚Äì11. Georgetown University Alumni &
Student Federal Credit Union is the oldest and largest all student-run
financial institution, with over $16 million in assets and 12,000 members. The
Georgetown University Student Investment Fund is one of a few undergraduate-run
investment funds in the United States, and hosted CNBC's Jim Cramer to tape
"Mad Money" in September 2006. Another student-run group, the Georgetown
Emergency Response Medical Service, "GERMS", is an all-volunteer ambulance
service founded in 1982 that serves campus and the surrounding communities.
Georgetown's Army Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) unit, the Hoya
Battalion, is the oldest military unit native to the District of Columbia, and
was awarded the top ranking among ROTC programs in 2012. The proportion of ROTC
students at Georgetown was the 79th highest among universities in the United
States . GUGS, the Georgetown University Grilling Society, has been a
Georgetown tradition since 2002, selling half-pound hamburgers in Red Square on
most Fridays. Activism. Georgetown University student organizations include a
diverse array of groups focused on social justice issues, including
organizations run through both Student Affairs and the Center for Social
Justice. Oriented against gender violence, Take Back the Night coordinates an
annual rally and march to protest against rape and other forms of violence
against women. Georgetown Solidarity Committee is a workers' rights
organization whose successes include ending use of sweatshops in producing
Georgetown-logoed apparel, and garnering pay raises for both university
cleaning staff and police. Georgetown Students for Fair Trade successfully
advocated for all coffee in campus cafeterias to be Fair Trade Certified.
Georgetown has many additional groups representing national, ethnic, and
linguistic interests. Georgetown's has the second most politically active
student body in the United States according to the "Princeton Review". Groups
based on local, national, and international issues are popular, and political
speech is protected on campus. Student political organizations are active on
campus and engage their many members in local and national politics. The
Georgetown University College Republicans represent their party, while the
Georgetown University College Democrats, the largest student organization on
campus in 2008, represent theirs. The reproductive rights organization H*yas
for Choice is not officially recognized by the University as its positions on
abortion are in opposition to University policy, prompting the asterisk in
"Hoyas". While not financially supported by the school, the organization is
permitted to meet and table in university spaces. The issue contributes to
Georgetown's 'red light' status on free speech under the Foundation for
Individual Rights in Education rating system. In 2010, the "Plan A: Hoyas for
Reproductive Justice" campaign led several protests against the school policy
against the sale of birth control on campus, and in 2007, Georgetown University
Law Center students protested the University's decision to cease funding for a
student's internship at Planned Parenthood's litigation department despite
funding it previous years. Law Center student Sandra Fluke petitioned the
university to change its health insurance policy to include coverage for
contraception for three years prior to addressing the issue before the House
Democratic Steering and Policy Committee in 2012. Though the remarks Rush
Limbaugh subsequently directed at Fluke were criticized by Georgetown
administrators as both misogynist and vitriolic, the school remains opposed to
the coverage. Media. Georgetown University has several student-run newspapers.
"The Hoya" is the University's oldest newspaper. It has been in print since
1920, and since 1987, has been published twice weekly. "The Georgetown Voice",
known for its weekly cover stories, is a newsmagazine that was founded in March
1969 to focus more attention on citywide and national issues. "The Georgetown
Independent" is a monthly journal of news, commentary and the arts. Founded in
1966, the "Georgetown Law Weekly" is the student-run paper on the Law Center
campus, and is a three time winner of the American Bar Association's Best
Newspaper award. "The Hoya" and "The Georgetown Voice" both run online blogs,
and there are other popular blogs written about the school and its sports
teams. "The Georgetown Academy", restarted in 2008 after a hiatus, targets
traditionalist Catholic readers, and the "Georgetown Federalist", founded in
2006, purports to bring a conservative and libertarian viewpoint to campus.
Other political publications include the "Georgetown Progressive", an online
publication run by the Georgetown University College Democrats, and
"Counterpoint Magazine", a liberal monthly founded in the spring of 2011. "The
Fire This Time" is Georgetown's minority newssource. "The Georgetown Heckler"
is a humor magazine founded on the Internet in 2003 by Georgetown students,
releasing its first print issue in 2007. "The Gonzo" was a former student humor
magazine, published from 1993 to 1998. The University has a campus-wide
television station, GUTV, which began broadcasting in 1999. The station hosts
an annual student film festival in April for campus filmmakers. WGTB,
Georgetown's radio station, is available as a webcast and on 92.3 FM in certain
dormitories. The station was founded in 1946, and broadcast on 90.1 FM from
1960 to 1979, when university president Timothy S. Healy gave away the
frequency and broadcast capabilities to the University of the District of
Columbia because of WGTB's far left political orientation. Greek life. Although
Jesuit schools are not obliged to disassociate from Greek systems, many do, and
Georgetown University officially recognizes and funds only one of the many
Greek organizations on campus, Alpha Phi Omega, the national co-ed community
service fraternity. Despite this, other Greek organizations also persist on
campus, although none requires members to live in fraternal housing.
Additionally, Georgetown University students are affiliated, in some cases,
with fraternities at other nearby universities and colleges. Active
fraternities at Georgetown include Delta Phi Epsilon, a professional foreign
service fraternity and sorority; Alpha Kappa Psi, a professional co-ed business
fraternity; Alpha Phi Omega, a national co-ed community service fraternity;
Alpha Epsilon Pi, a Jewish social fraternity; and social fraternities Sigma Phi
Epsilon, Zeta Psi, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, and Zeta Beta Tau. Delta Phi Epsilon
was founded at Georgetown in 1920, and members of their Alpha Chapter include
Jesuits and several deans of the School of Foreign Service. The Delta Phi
Epsilon foreign service sorority, founded in 1973, is the only sorority active
at Georgetown. Georgetown's chapter of Alpha Epsilon Pi, affiliated with the ,
was established in 2002. Sigma Phi Epsilon chartered its chapter as a general
social fraternity in 2007. The Omega Lambda chapter of professional business
fraternity Alpha Kappa Psi replaced Delta Sigma Pi, which lost its charter in
2006. The Zeta Psi chapter, named Gamma Epsilon, was chartered in March 2009
after a year as a colony. Events. Annual events on campus celebrate Georgetown
traditions, culture, alumni, sports, and politics. In late April, Georgetown
University celebrates "Georgetown Day". Besides the full-day carnival, the day
rewards the best professor of the year with the Dorothy Brown Award, as voted
by students. Halloween is celebrated with public viewings of alumnus William
Peter Blatty's film "The Exorcist", which takes place in the neighborhood
surrounding the university. Homecoming coincides with a home football game, and
festivities such as tailgating and a formal dance are sponsored by the Alumni
Association to draw past graduates back to campus. The largest planned sports
related celebration is the first basketball practice of the season. Dubbed
"Midnight Madness", this event introduces the men's and women's basketball
teams shortly after midnight on the first day the teams are allowed by NCAA
rules to formally practice together. In 2013, Georgetown will again host the
east regional finals round of the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament. Georgetown
University hosts notable speakers each year, largely because of the success of
the Georgetown Lecture Fund and the Office of Communications. These are

whose origin is uncertain. Sometime before 1893, students well versed in
classical languages invented the mixed Greek and Latin chant of "Hoya Saxa",
translating roughly as "what (or such) rocks". The school's baseball team, then
called the Stonewalls, began in 1870, and football in 1874, and the chant
likely refers to one of these teams. By the 1920s, the term "Hoyas" was used to
