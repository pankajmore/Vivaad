Enlargement of NATO Enlargement of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) is the process of including new member states in NATO. NATO is a
military alliance of states in Europe and North America whose organization
constitutes a system of collective defence. The process of joining the alliance
is governed by Article 10 of the North Atlantic Treaty and by subsequent
agreements. Countries wishing to join have to meet certain requirements and
complete a multi-step process involving political dialogue and military
integration. The accession process is overseen by the North Atlantic Council,
NATO's governing body. After its formation in 1949, NATO grew by including
Greece and Turkey in 1952 and West Germany in 1955, and then later Spain in
1982. After the Cold War ended, and Germany reunited in 1990, there was a
debate in NATO about continued expansion eastward. In 1999, Poland, Hungary,
and the Czech Republic joined the organization, amid much debate within the
organization and Russian opposition. Another expansion came with the accession
of seven Northern European and Eastern European countries: Estonia, Latvia,
Lithuania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Bulgaria, and Romania. These nations were first
invited to start talks of membership during the 2002 Prague summit, and joined
NATO on 29 March 2004, shortly before the 2004 Istanbul summit. Most recently,
Albania and Croatia joined on 1 April 2009, shortly before the 2009
Strasbourg‚ÄìKehl summit. Future expansion is currently a topic of debate in
many countries. Cyprus and Macedonia are stalled from accession by,
respectively, Turkey and Greece, pending the resolution of disputes between
them. Other countries which have a stated goal of eventually joining include
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, and Georgia. The incorporation of former
Warsaw Pact countries has been a cause of increased tension between NATO
countries and Russia. Mikhail Gorbachev reportedly agreed to allow German
reunification within NATO after being promised that NATO would not expand "one
inch to the east." Past enlargements. NATO has added new members six times
since its founding in 1949, and NATO comprises twenty-eight members. Twelve
countries were part of the founding of NATO: Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France,
Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the United
Kingdom, and the United States. In 1990, with the reunification of Germany,
NATO grew to include the former country of East Germany. Between 1994 and 1997,
wider forums for regional cooperation between NATO and its neighbors were set
up, including the Partnership for Peace, the Mediterranean Dialogue initiative
and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council. In 1997, three former communist
countries, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Poland, were invited to join NATO.
After this fourth enlargement in 1999, the Vilnius group of The Baltics and
seven East European countries formed in May 2000 to cooperate and lobby for
further NATO membership. Seven of these countries joined in the fifth
enlargement in 2004. Albania and Croatia joined in the sixth enlargement in
2009. Criteria and process. Article 10. This article poses two general limits
to non-member states. European states are eligible for membership and these
states need the approval of all the existing member states. The second
criterion means that every member state can put some criteria forward that have
to be attained. In practice, NATO formulates in most cases a common set of
criteria, but for instance Greece blocks the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia's accession to NATO, due to the disagreement over the use of the name
Macedonia. Turkey similarly opposes the participation of the Republic of Cyprus
with NATO institutions as long as the Cyprus dispute is not resolved.
Individual Partnership Action Plan. NATO began the Individual Partnership
Action Plans programme at the 2002 Prague Summit, as a mechanism to tailor
relations with specific countries, which may include eventual membership. The
programme is also used for countries not intending to join NATO, but that
require the additional diplomatic resources. Plans have so far only been
implemented with countries already members of the NATO-organized Partnership
for Peace. As of 2009, Individual Partnership Action Plans are in
implementation with eight countries: Georgia, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Bosnia and
Herzegovina, Kazakhstan, Moldova, and Montenegro. In February 2011 Serbia
decided to initiate the procedure for IPAP and its presentation document was
submitted to NATO on 25 November 2011. Armenia, Azerbaijan, Serbia and
Kazakhstan have stated they have no desire to join NATO. Georgia, Montenegro
and Bosnia and Herzegovina, on the other hand, are actively working towards
future NATO membership. Intensified Dialogue. Intensified Dialogue is viewed as
an additional stage before being invited to enter the alliance Membership
Action Plan (MAP), that may complement that country's Individual Partnership
Action Plan. As of 2010, Georgia and Ukraine are engaged in an Intensified
Dialogue with NATO. In Spring 2008 both were promised to get Membership Action
Plans at a later date, but in 2010 Ukraine announced that it no longer has NATO
membership as a goal. Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina participate in
Intensified Dialogue, but have also received Membership Action Plans. Serbia
was also offered an Intensified Dialogue program on 3 April 2008, but made no
response to accept the offer. Membership Action Plan. Georgia has expressed
interest in receiving a MAP. Ukraine had expressed interest in receiving a MAP
before June 2010, when it announced a policy change of not seeking NATO
membership. Previously, at the 2008 NATO summit in Bucharest, both countries
had not received MAPs but instead a vague promise to be admitted to NATO at
some point; however, Georgia's war with Russia later that year crippled its
military and revealed how contentious their prospective membership was. Former
MAP participants were Albania and Croatia between May 2002 and April 2009, when
they joined NATO. The final accession process, once invited, involves five
steps leading up to the signing of the accession protocols and the acceptance
and ratification of those protocols by the governments of the current NATO
members. Georgia and former Yugoslav republics Macedonia, Montenegro, Bosnia
and Herzegovina were designated as "aspirant countries" at the North Atlantic
Council meeting on 7 December 2011. Future enlargement. Montenegro, Macedonia,
and Bosnia and Herzegovina are currently the only countries with a Membership
Action Plan. In 2008, Greece blocked an invitation to its northern neighbor,
pending resolution of the Macedonia naming dispute. Macedonia was part of the
Vilnius group, and had formed the Adriatic Charter with Croatia and Albania in
2003 to better coordinate NATO accession. NATO is unlikely to invite countries
such as Austria, Finland, Ireland, Sweden, and Switzerland, where the policy of
neutrality is protected by current legislation and the popularity of non-
alignment holds sway. Bosnia and Herzegovina. The 1995 NATO bombing of Bosnia
and Herzegovina targeted the Bosnian Serb Army and together with international
pressure led to the resolution of the Bosnian War and the signing of the Dayton
Agreement in 1995. Since then, NATO has led the Implementation Force and
Stabilization Force, and other peacekeeping efforts in the country. Bosnia and
Herzegovina joined the Partnership for Peace in 2006, and signed an agreement
on security cooperation in March 2007. The nation began further cooperation
with NATO within their Individual Partnership Action Plan in January 2008.
Bosnia then started the process of Intensified Dialogue at the 2008 Bucharest
summit. The country was invited to join the Adriatic Charter of NATO aspirants
on 25 September 2008. Then in November 2008, a joint announcement from the
Defence Minister and NATO Mission Office in Sarajevo suggested that Bosnia and
Herzegovina could join NATO by 2011 if it continues with the reforms made in
the defence-area so far. In January 2009, Defence Minister Selmo Cikotiƒá again
confirmed Bosnia's interest in seeking a Membership Action Plan (MAP) at the
2009 summit, with membership by 2012 at the latest. In February 2009 The
Defence Minister of BiH Selmo Cikotic presented some poll numbers on NATO-
membership: 70% of the country supports NATO-membership; However while 89% of
the Federation Entity supports NATO-membership, only in 35% RS-entity did.
While the country did not receive an MAP at the April 2009 summit in
Strasbourg‚ÄìKehl, Stuart Jones, an official of the US State Department, said
on a September 2009 visit to Bosnia and Herzegovina that NATO was going to look
at the possibilities for them to receive one in a December 2009 summit,
repeating strong US support for the possibility. Then on 2 October 2009, Haris
Silajd≈æiƒá, the Bosniak Member of the Presidency, announced official
application for Membership Action Plan. On 22 April 2010, NATO agreed to launch
the Membership Action Plan for Bosnia and Herzegovina, but with certain
conditions attached. Turkey is thought to be the biggest supporter of Bosnian
membership, and heavily influenced the decision. Georgia. Georgia has moved
quickly following the Rose Revolution in 2003 to seek closer ties with and
eventual membership of NATO. Georgia's powerful northern neighbor, Russia, has
opposed the closer ties, including those expressed at the 2008 Bucharest summit
where NATO members promised that Georgia would eventually join the
organization. Complications in the relationship between NATO and Georgia
includes presence of Russian forces in internationally-recognized Georgian
territory as a result of multiple recent conflicts, like the 2008 South Ossetia
war, over the territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, both of which are home
to a large number of citizens of the Russian Federation. A nonbinding
referendum in 2008 resulted in 77% of voters supporting NATO accession. On 21
November 2011, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev while addressing soldiers in
Vladikavkaz near the Georgian border stated that the 2008 invasion had
prevented any further NATO enlargement into the former Soviet sphere.
Macedonia. NATO's invitation to Macedonia was blocked by Greece at the 2008
Bucharest summit. NATO nations agreed that the country would receive an
invitation upon resolution of the Macedonia naming dispute. Greece believes
that its neighbor's constitutional name implies territorial aspirations against
its own region of Greek Macedonia. After the veto, Greece was sued in the
International Court of Justice, over the use of "the Former Yugoslav Republic
of Macedonia" as an acceptable option to enter NATO with. The ICJ ruled in
December 2011 that Greece was wrong to have blocked its neighbor's bid. Greece
may also block Macedonia's accession to the European Union over the naming
dispute. A poll following the summit showed that 82.5% of citizens surveyed
opposed changing the constitutional name in order to join NATO. NATO membership
in general is supported by 85.2% of the population. Elections were called
following the 2008 summit, resulting in further support for the center-right
pro-NATO party, VMRO‚ÄìDPMNE. The elections were marred by violence that was
criticized by NATO members. The country joined the Partnership for Peace in
1995, and commenced its Membership Action Plan in 1999, at the same time as
Albania. Participating in the 1999 NATO intervention in Kosovo, it received aid
from NATO in dealing with refugees fleeing from Kosovo. In August 2001, NATO
intervened in the 2001 insurgency, during which a rebel Albanian group, the
National Liberation Army, fought government forces. In Operation Essential
Harvest, NATO troops joined with the Macedonian military to disarm rebel forces
following a cease-fire agreement. Montenegro. In 2005 the Parliament of Serbia
and Montenegro had paved its way for NATO membership by adopting a Resolution
in favor for it. Montenegro declared independence from its State Union with
Serbia on 3 June 2006. The new country subsequently joined the Partnership for
Peace programme at the 2006 Riga summit. In November 2007, Montenegro signed a
transit agreement with NATO, allowing the alliance's troops to move across the
country. Montenegro then signed an agreement with the United States, in which
Montenegro will destroy its outdated weaponry as a precondition for NATO
membership. In late 2007, Montenegro's Defence Minister Boro Vuƒçiniƒá said
that Montenegro would intensify its accession to the alliance after the 2008
Bucharest summit. Montenegro has received support for its membership from many
NATO countries, including Romania and Turkey. Montenegro adopted an Individual
Partnership Action Plan in June 2008 and was invited to join the Adriatic
Charter of NATO aspirants on 25 September 2008. The country applied for a
Membership Action Plan on 5 November 2008 with support of Prime Minister Milo
ƒêukanoviƒá, which was granted in December 2009. The present political climate
in dubious on Montenegro's potential membership in the NATO. According to the
October 2009 poll, only 31.2% of Montenegro's populace is in support of NATO
membership, while 44% is opposed. The memory of NATO's 1999 bombing campaign of
the then Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and its destruction and civilian
casualties thereof form a crucial part of the dominating opposition to NATO
membership in Montenegro, although NATO's role and approach to the Kosovo
problem have further considerably aided the objection. Serbia's recent declared
"military neutrality" has also influenced on Montenegro's non-decisive position
on the question of NATO membership. Montenegro has begun to contribute to NATO
military missions. The country plans to deploy 40 soldiers, a three member
military medical team, and two officers under German command to Afghanistan in
2010. Montenegrin peacekeepers will also be deployed to Liberia and Somalia.
Relations with other countries. Armenia. Armenia has signed up for the
Partnership for Peace programme and the Individual Partnership Action Plan, but
Armenia is unlikely to join NATO as its policies often align it closer with
Russia, and it remains a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States.
Armenia pulled out of its participation in NATO military exercises in Georgia
on 8 May 2009, because of NATO's Secretary-General's alleged support of
Azerbaijan, possibly making it even less likely that Armenia will eventually
join NATO. Azerbaijan. According to a NATO diplomatic source in August 2009
some key officials at NATO headquarters in Brussels were pushing hard for
engaging Azerbaijan on the membership question. "Turkey, Romania, Italy,
Poland, the United Kingdom and the Baltic states" are among the members backing
a fast track for Azerbaijan's NATO membership. While President Ilham Aliyev has
generally supported neutrality since his rise to power in 2003, Azerbaijan has
however hosted NATO military exercises and high-profile meetings in 2009. The
unresolved conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh would present a major roadblock to
membership. Finland. Finland participates in nearly all sub-areas of the
Partnership for Peace programme, and has provided peacekeeping forces to both
the Afghanistan and Kosovo missions. However, a 2005 poll indicated that the
public was strongly against NATO membership. The possibility of Finland's
membership in NATO was one of the most important issues debated in relation to
the Finnish presidential election of 2006. The main opposition candidate in the
2006 election, Sauli Niinist√∂ of the National Coalition Party, supported
Finland joining a "more European" NATO. Fellow right-winger Henrik Lax of the
Swedish People's Party likewise supported the concept. On the other side,
president Tarja Halonen of the Social Democratic Party opposed changing the
status quo, as did most other candidates in the election. Her victory and re-
election to the post of president has currently put the issue of a NATO
membership for Finland on hold for at least the duration of her term. Finland
could however change its official position on NATO membership after the new EU
treaty clarifies if there will be any new EU-level defence deal, but in the
meantime Finnish Defence Forces are making technical preparations for
membership, stating that it would increase Finland's security. Currently no
political party explicitly supports NATO membership. Other political figures of
Finland who have weighed in with opinions include former President of Finland
Martti Ahtisaari who has argued that Finland should join all the organizations
supported by other Western democracies in order "to shrug off once and for all
the burden of Finlandization". Another ex-president, Mauno Koivisto, opposes
the idea, arguing that NATO membership would ruin Finland's relations with
Russia. Finland has received some very critical feedback from Russia for even
considering the possibility of joining NATO, with a 2009 study suggesting this
could have repercussions for Russia's relations with the EU and NATO as a
whole. In October 2009, Finnish Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen reiterated that
Finland had no plans to join NATO, and stated that the main lesson of the 2008
South Ossetia war was the need for closer ties to Russia. India. In September
2011, The NATO alliance invited India to be a partner in its ballistic missile
defence (BMD). According to the reports a TOP NATO official stated addressing
Indian representatives, "You have a missile threat that confronts you. We have
a missile threat that confronts us. It‚Äôs a different one, but our ability to
defend against it could be the same. We have cooperation on those kind of
issues. [..]Democracies face challenges that are common. We need to work
together and resolve. We need to cooperate, because individually we cannot deal
with such threats. It is better to deal with such issues commonly than deal
with them individually" V. K Saraswat, the architect of Indian BMD program,
subsequently informed, "We are analysing the report. It is under
consideration." U.S. NATO Ambassador Ivo H. Daalder has suggested that India
should turn away from its non-aligned role and join NATO. Voice of Russia
analyst quoted Robert Pshel, head of NATO‚Äôs Information Office in Moscow as
saying "I agree with Mr Daalder that many modern threats are global, and
tackling them without emerging powers like India is hardly possible." Daalder
further stated, ‚ÄúThe dialogue should be on how India's concept of its own
security and of international security fits in with NATO's concept of
international security and how NATO as an actor and India as a country can work
together to promote security,‚Äù According to some reports The United States
and India have already studied the possibility of a joint missile defence
system, albeit former Defence Secretary Robert Gates stated that "talks were
only in their early stages." There were some doubts regarding Indian Armed
Forces's level of participation in case an NATO-sponsored war breaks out in
Asia. Boris Volkonsky of the "Russian Strategic Research Institute" was quoted
as saying, "an ally like India would strengthen Washington‚Äôs hand in South
and Southwest Asia and other world areas." Some reports purported that there is
one ulterior motive which is a common Indian and American fear of the "rising
dragon of China". And while most members of the Indian strategic community
readily admit that NATO‚Äôs Afghanistan mission coincides with India‚Äôs own
strategic interest in stabilising that country, they do not necessarily
conclude from this that India and NATO should develop closer cooperation. It is
believed that many Indian analysts harbour doubts about the possible
implications for their country‚Äôs international position should it develop
closer ties with NATO. In a report published by "NATO review" it said, ‚ÄúThe
choice should be clear: exploiting NATO‚Äôs potential as a forum for
consultation and cooperation is a 'win-win' situation, both for India and for
the Alliance.‚Äù Moldova. Moldova does not currently have plans to join NATO.
It has participated in the Partnership for Peace programme and the Individual
Partnership Action Plan. The former communist government was seen as more
allied with Russia and is already a member of the Commonwealth of Independent
States. In April 2009 Moldova announced it would not participate in the June
NATO military exercises. The new ruling party, the Alliance for European
Integration, elected in the Moldovan parliamentary election, July 2009, has
declined to so far take any action to either move it toward membership, or
withdraw from the Commonwealth of Independent States, and denies plans to do
either. Moldova also has an ongoing internal conflict with the territory of
Transnistria. Russia. In April 2009, the Polish Foreign Minister, Rados≈Çaw
Sikorski, suggested including Russia in NATO. In March 2010 this suggestion was
repeated in an open letter co-written by German defense experts General Klaus
Naumann, Frank Elbe, Ulrich Weisser, and former German Defense Minister Volker
R√ºhe. In the letter it was suggested that Russia was needed in the wake of an
emerging multi-polar world in order for NATO to counterbalance emerging Asian
powers. However Russian leadership has made it clear that Russia does not plan
to join the alliance, preferring to keep cooperation on a lower level. The
Russian envoy to NATO, Dmitry Rogozin, is quoted as saying "Great powers don't
join coalitions, they create coalitions. Russia considers itself a great
power," although he said that Russia did not rule out membership at some point
in the future. Serbia. Serbia originally determined in 2005, as Serbia and
Montenegro, to join NATO. The subsequent independence of Montenegro and Kosovo
have strained relations between Serbia and NATO. Serbia however joined the
Partnership for Peace programme during the 2006 Riga Summit. While this
programme is sometimes the first step towards full NATO membership, it is
uncertain whether Serbia perceives it as signaling an intent to join the
alliance. NATO historically fought Bosnian-Serbian forces during the Bosnia war
and Serbia during the 1999 Kosovo conflict. Following NATO's open support to
Kosovo's declaration of independence in January 2008, support for NATO
integration greatly dropped. An earlier poll in September 2007 had showed that
28% of Serbian citizens supported NATO membership, with 58% supporting the
Partnership for Peace. The only political parties which currently support NATO
integration are the minor opposition Liberal Democratic Party and Serbian
Renewal Movement. The Democratic Party abandoned its pro-NATO attitude,
claiming the Partnership for Peace is enough. Although current Serbian
priorities do not include NATO membership, the Alliance has offered Serbia an
invitation to enter the intensified dialogue programme whenever the country is
ready. On 1 October 2008, Serbian Defence Minister Dragan ≈ utanovac signed the
Information Exchange Agreement with the NATO, one of the prerequisites for
fuller membership in the Partnership for Peace programme. Sweden. In 1949
Sweden chose not to join NATO and declared a security policy aiming for non-
alignment in peace and neutrality in war. A modified version now qualifies non-
alignment in peace for possible neutrality in war. As such, the Swedish
government decided not to participate in the membership of NATO because they
wanted to remain neutral in a potential war. This position was maintained
without much discussion during the Cold War. Since the 1990s however there has
been an active debate in Sweden on the question of NATO membership in the
post‚ÄìCold War world. These ideological divides were visible again in November
2006 when Sweden could either buy two new transport planes or join NATO's plane
pool, and in December 2006, when Sweden was invited to join the NATO Response
Force. While the governing parties in Sweden have opposed membership, they have
participated in NATO-led missions in Bosnia (IFOR and SFOR), Kosovo (KFOR),
Afghanistan (ISAF) and Libya (Operation Unified Protector). The Swedish Centre
Party and Social Democratic party have remained in favor of non-alignment. This
preference is shared by the Green party, Left party and the Christian
Democrats. The right wing Moderate Party as well as the Liberal party are the
only parties with representation in the parliament today that are in favor of
NATO membership. Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt stated on 18 September 2007
that Swedish membership in NATO would require a "very wide" majority in
Parliament, including the social democrats, and coordination with Finland. A
2005 poll indicated that 46% of Swedes were opposed to NATO membership, with
22% supporting it. Another poll in May 2008 showed that 37% of the Swedes are
in favor of membership, while 41% are against. Support for NATO membership
though, has risen dramatically since March 2008, when only 29% were in favor.
Ukraine. At the beginning of 2008, the Ukrainian President, Prime Minister and
head of parliament sent an official letter to apply for the Membership Action
Plan. The idea of Ukrainian membership in NATO has gained support from a number
of NATO leaders. At the 2008 Bucharest summit, NATO Secretary General Jaap de
Hoop Scheffer declared in a press conference that Georgia and Ukraine will join
NATO. Within the NATO-Ukraine working commission, NATO officials reassured
Ukraine officials that they are willing to invite their country to join the
Alliance. The Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia, Alexander Grushko, announced
that NATO membership for Ukraine was not in Russia's best interests and
wouldn't help the relations of the two countries. According to numerous
independent polls conducted since 2002, Ukrainian public opinion on NATO
membership is split, with the majority of those polled against joining the
military alliance and many identifying it as a threat. According to the FOM-
Ukraine pollster, as of April 2009, 57% of Ukrainians polled were against
joining the alliance, while 21% were in favor. A Gallup poll conducted in
October 2008 showed that 45% associated NATO as a threat to their country,
while only 15% associated it with protection. Protests, such as the Crimean
anti-NATO protests of 2006, have taken place by opposition blocs against the
idea, and petitions signed urging the end of relations with NATO. Influential
Ukrainian politicians like Yuriy Yekhanurov and Yulia Tymoshenko have stated
Ukraine will not join NATO as long as the public continues opposing the move.
This was also confirmed by a 6 March 2008 agreement between the parliamentary
coalition and opposition parties which says that any international agreements
regarding Ukraine‚Äôs entry to NATO must be decided by referendum. Recently the
Ukrainian government started an information campaign, aimed at informing the
Ukrainian people about the consequences of membership. The 2010 election
returned Viktor Yanukovych as Ukrainian President and marked a turnaround in
Ukraine's relations with NATO. In February 2010, he stated that Ukraine's
relations with NATO were currently "well-defined", and that there was "no
question of Ukraine joining NATO". He said the issue of Ukrainian membership of
NATO might "emerge at some point, but we will not see it in the immediate
future." While visiting Brussels in March 2010, he further stated that there
would be no change to Ukraine's status as a member of the alliance's outreach
program. He later reiterated during a trip to Moscow that Ukraine would remain
a "European, non-aligned state." Then, on 3 June 2010 the Ukrainian parliament
voted to exclude the goal of "integration into Euro-Atlantic security and NATO
membership" from the country's national security strategy in a bill drafted by
Yanukovych himself. The bill forbids Ukraine's membership of any military bloc,
but allows for co-operation with alliances such as NATO. "European integration"
is still part of Ukraine's national security strategy.
