Economic history Economic history is the study of economies or economic
phenomena in the past. Analysis in economic history is undertaken using a
combination of historical methods, statistical methods, and by applying
economic theory to historical situations and institutions. The topic includes
business history, financial history and overlaps with areas of social history
such as demographic history and labor history. Quantitative (econometric)
economic history is also referred to as Cliometrics. Development as a separate
field. Treating economic history as a discrete academic discipline has been a
contentious issue for many years. Academics at the London School of Economics
and the University of Cambridge had numerous disputes over the separation of
economics and economic history in the interwar era. Cambridge economists
believed that pure economics involved a component of economic history and that
the two were inseparably entangled. Those at the LSE believed that economic
history warranted its own courses, research agenda and academic chair separated
from mainstream economics. In the initial period of the subject's development,
the LSE position of separating economic history from economics won out. Many
universities in the UK developed independent programmes in economic history
rooted in the LSE model. Indeed, the Economic History Society had its
inauguration at LSE in 1926 and the University of Cambridge eventually
established its own economic history programme. However, the past twenty years
have witnessed the widespread closure of these separate programmes in the UK
and the integration of the discipline into either history or economics
departments. Only the LSE and the University of Glasgow retain separate
economic history departments and stand-alone undergraduate and graduate
programmes in economic history. The LSE, Glasgow and the University of Oxford
together train the vast majority of economic historians coming through the
British higher education system. In the US, economic history has for a long
time been regarded as a form of applied economics. As a consequence, there are
no specialist economic history graduate programs at any mainstream university
anywhere in the country. Instead economic history is taught as a special field
component of regular economics PhD programs in some places, including at
University of California, Berkeley, Harvard University, Northwestern University
and Yale University. In recent decades economic historians, following Douglass
North, have tended to move away from narrowly quantitative studies toward
institutional, social, and cultural history affecting the evolution of
economies.Â Â  â€¢ E. Aerts and H. Van der Wee, 2002. "Economic History,"

Abstract. However, this trend has been criticized, most forcefully by Francesco
Boldizzoni, as a form of economic imperialism "extending the neoclassical
explanatory model to the realm of social relations." Relationship between
economics and economic history. Yale University economist Irving Fisher wrote
in 1933 on the relationship between economics and economic history in his
"Debt-Deflation Theory of Great Depressions" ("Econometrica", Vol. 1, No. 4:
337â€“338): 'The study of dis-equilibrium may proceed in either of two ways. We
may take as our unit for study an actual historical case of great dis-
equilibrium, such as, say, the panic of 1873; or we may take as our unit for
study any constituent tendency, such as, say, deflation, and discover its
general laws, relations to, and combinations with, other tendencies. The former
study revolves around events, or facts; the latter, around tendencies. The
former is primarily economic history; the latter is primarily economic science.
Both sorts of studies are proper and important. Each helps the other. The panic
of 1873 can only be understood in light of the various tendencies
involvedâ€”deflation and other; and deflation can only be understood in the
light of various historical manifestationsâ€”1873 and other." There is a school
of thought among economic historians that splits economic historyâ€”the study
of how economic phenomena evolved in the pastâ€”from historical
economicsâ€”testing the generality of economic theory using historical
episodes. US economic historian Charles P. Kindleberger explained this position
in his 1990 book "Historical Economics: Art or Science?". One of the
professional societies for economic historians in Europe is also called the
European Historical Economics Society to reflect this emphasis. The new
economic history, also known as cliometrics, refers to the systematic use of
economic theory and/or econometric techniques to the study of economic history.
The term cliometrics was originally coined by Jonathan R. T. Hughes and Stanley
Reiter in 1960 and refers to Clio, who was the muse of history and heroic
poetry in Greek mythology. Cliometricians argue their approach is necessary
because the application of theory is crucial in writing solid economic history,
while historians generally oppose this view warning against the risk of
generating anachronisms. Early cliometrics was a type of counterfactual
history. However, counterfactualism is no longer its distinctive feature. Some
have argued that cliometrics had its heyday in the 1960s and 1970s and that it
is now neglected by economists and historians.
