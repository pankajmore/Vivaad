Arrow's impossibility theorem In social choice theory, Arrowâ€™s impossibility
theorem, the General Possibility Theorem, or Arrowâ€™s paradox, states that,
when voters have three or more distinct alternatives (options), no rank order
voting system can convert the ranked preferences of individuals into a
community-wide (complete and transitive) ranking while also meeting a specific
set of criteria. These criteria are called "unrestricted domain", "non-
dictatorship", "Pareto efficiency", and "independence of irrelevant
alternatives". The theorem is often cited in discussions of election theory as
it is further interpreted by the Gibbardâ€“Satterthwaite theorem. The theorem
is named after economist Kenneth Arrow, who demonstrated the theorem in his
Ph.D. thesis and popularized it in his 1951 book "Social Choice and Individual
Values". The original paper was titled "A Difficulty in the Concept of Social
Welfare". Voting systems that use cardinal utility (which conveys more
information than rank orders; see the subsection discussing the cardinal
utility approach to overcoming the negative conclusion) are not covered by the
theorem. The theorem can also be sidestepped by weakening the notion of
independence. Arrow, like many economists, rejected cardinal utility as a
meaningful tool for expressing social welfare, and so focused his theorem on
preference rankings. The axiomatic approach Arrow adopted can treat all
conceivable rules (that are based on preferences) within one unified framework.
In that sense, the approach is qualitatively different from the earlier one in
voting theory, in which rules were investigated one by one. One can therefore
say that the contemporary paradigm of social choice theory started from this
theorem. Statement of the theorem. The need to aggregate preferences occurs in
many different disciplines: in welfare economics, where one attempts to find an
economic outcome which would be acceptable and stable; in decision theory,
where a person has to make a rational choice based on several criteria; and
most naturally in voting systems, which are mechanisms for extracting a
decision from a multitude of voters' preferences. Arrow's theorem says that if
the decision-making body has at least two members and at least three options to
decide among, then it is impossible to design a social welfare function that
satisfies all these conditions at once. The later version of this theorem is
strongerâ€”has weaker conditionsâ€”since monotonicity, non-imposition, and
independence of irrelevant alternatives together imply Pareto efficiency,
whereas Pareto efficiency and independence of irrelevant alternatives together
do not imply monotonicity. (Incidentally, Pareto efficiency on its own implies
non-imposition.) Remarks on IIA Formal statement of the theorem. Let formula_1
be a set of outcomes, formula_2 a number of voters or decision criteria. We
shall denote the set of all full linear orderings of formula_1 by formula_4. A
(strict) social welfare function (preference aggregation rule) is a function
formula_5 which aggregates voters' preferences into a single preference order
on formula_1. Informal proof. Based on the proof by John Geanakoplos of Cowles
Foundation, Yale University published by Economic Theory (journal) in 2005. (An
attempt to improve upon it appeared on the same journal in 2012.) We wish to
prove that any social choice system respecting unrestricted domain, unanimity,
and independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) is a dictatorship. Part one:
there is a "pivotal" voter for B. Say there are three choices for society, call
them A, B, and C. Suppose first that everyone prefers option B the least. That
is, everyone prefers every other option to B. By unanimity, society must prefer
every option to B. Specifically, society prefers A and C to B. Call this
situation "Profile 1". On the other hand, if everyone preferred B to everything
else, then society would have to prefer B to everything else by unanimity. So
it is clear that, if we take "Profile 1" and, running through the members in
the society in some arbitrary but monotonic order, move B from the bottom of
each person's preference list to the top, there must be some point at which B
moves off the bottom of society's preferences as well, since we know it
eventually ends up at the top. When it happens, we call that voter the "pivotal
voter". We now want to show that, at the point when the pivotal voter "n" moves
B off the bottom of his preferences to the top, the society's B moves to the
top of its preferences as well, not to an intermediate point. To prove this,
consider what would happen if it were not true. Then, after "n" has moved B to
the top (i.e., when voters formula_19 have B at the top and voters formula_20
still have B at the bottom) society would have some option more preferable than
B, say A, and one less preferable than B, say C. Now if each person moves his
preference for C above A, then society would prefer C to A by unanimity. But
moving C above A should not change anything about how B and C compare, by
independence of irrelevant alternatives. That is, since B is either at the very
top or bottom of each person's preferences, moving C or A around does not
change how either compares with B, leaving B preferred to C. Similarly, by
independence of irrelevant alternatives society still prefers A to B because
the changing of C and A does not affect how A and B compare. Since C is above
A, and A is above B, C must be above B in the social preference ranking. We
have reached an absurd conclusion. Therefore, when the voters formula_19 have
moved B from the bottom of their preferences to the top, society moves B from
the bottom all the way to the top, not some intermediate point. Note that even
with a different starting profile, say "Profile 1' ", if the order of moving
preference of B is unchanged, the pivotal voter remains "n". That is, the
pivotal voter is determined only by the moving order, and not by the starting
profile. It can be seen as following. If we concentrate on a pair of B and one
of other choices, during each step on the process, preferences in the pair are
unchanged whether we start from "Profile 1" and "Profile 1' " for every person.
Therefore by IIA, preference in the pair should be unchanged. Since it applies
to every other choices, for "Profile 1' ", the position of B remains at bottom
before "n" and remains at top after and including "n", just as "Profile 1".
Part two: voter "n" is a dictator for Aâ€“C. We show that voter "n" dictates
society's decision between A and C. if "n" prefers A to C, then the society
prefers A to C and if "n" prefers C to A, then the society prefers C to A. Let
p1 be "any profile in which" voter n prefers A to C. We show that society
prefers A to C. In "Profile 2", all voters "up to" (not including) "n" have B
at the top of their preferences and the rest (including "n") have B at the
bottom. In "Profile 3", all voters "up to" (and including) "n" have B at the
top and the rest have B at the bottom. everyone up to "n" ranks B at the top,
"n" ranks A above B above C, and everyone else ranks B at the bottom. As far as
the Aâ€“B decision is concerned, p4 is just as in "Profile 2", which we proved
puts A above B (in "Profile 2", B is actually at the bottom of the social
ordering). C's new position is irrelevant to the Bâ€“A ordering for society
because of IIA. Likewise, p4 has a relationship between B and C that is just as
in "Profile 3", which we proved has B above C (B is actually at the top). We
can conclude from these two observations that society puts A above B above C at
p4. Since the relative rankings of A and C are the same across p1 and p4, we
conclude that society puts A above C at p1. Similarly, we can show that if q1
is any profile in which voter n prefers C to A, then society prefers C to A. It
follows that person "n" is a (local) dictator over {A, C}. Remark. Since B is
irrelevant (IIA) to the decision between A and C, the fact that we assumed
particular profiles that put B in particular places does not matter. This was
just a way of finding out, by example, who the dictator over A and C was. But
all we need to know is that he exists. Part three: there can be at most one
dictator. Finally, we show that the (local) dictator over {A, C} is a (global)
dictator: he also dictates over {A, B} and over {B, C}. We will use the fact
(which can be proved easily) that if formula_22 is a strict linear order, then
it contains no "cycles" such as formula_23. We have proved in Part two that
there are (local) dictators i over {A, B}, j over {B, C}, and k over {A, C}. It
follows that i=j=k, establishing that the local dictator over {A, C} is a
global one. Interpretations of the theorem. Although Arrow's theorem is a
mathematical result, it is often expressed in a non-mathematical way with a
statement such as ""No voting method is fair,"" ""Every ranked voting method is
flawed,"" or ""The only voting method that isn't flawed is a dictatorship"".
These statements are simplifications of Arrow's result which are not
universally considered to be true. What Arrow's theorem does state is that a
deterministic preferential voting mechanism - that is, one where a preference
order is the only information in a vote, and any possible set of votes gives a
unique result - cannot comply with all of the conditions given above
simultaneously. Arrow did use the term "fair" to refer to his criteria. Indeed,
Pareto efficiency, as well as the demand for non-imposition, seems acceptable
to most people. Various theorists have suggested weakening the IIA criterion as
a way out of the paradox. Proponents of ranked voting methods contend that the
IIA is an unreasonably strong criterion. It is the one breached in most useful
voting systems. Advocates of this position point out that failure of the
standard IIA criterion is trivially implied by the possibility of cyclic
preferences. then the pairwise majority preference of the group is that A wins
over B, B wins over C, and C wins over A: these yield rock-paper-scissors
preferences for any pairwise comparison. In this circumstance, "any"
aggregation rule that satisfies the very basic majoritarian requirement that a
candidate who receives a majority of votes must win the election, will fail the
IIA criterion, if social preference is required to be transitive (or acyclic).
To see this, suppose that such a rule satisfies IIA. Since majority preferences
are respected, the society prefers A to B (two votes for A>B and one for B>A),
B to C, and C to A. Thus a cycle is generated, which contradicts the assumption
that social preference is transitive. So, what Arrow's theorem really shows is
that any majority-wins voting system is a non-trivial game, and that game
theory should be used to predict the outcome of most voting mechanisms. This
could be seen as a discouraging result, because a game need not have efficient
equilibria, "e.g.", a ballot could result in an alternative nobody really
wanted in the first place, yet everybody voted for. Remark: Scalar rankings
from a vector of attributes and the IIA property. The IIA property might not be
satisfied in human decision-making of realistic complexity because the "scalar"
preference ranking is effectively derived from the weightingâ€”not usually
explicitâ€”of a "vector" of attributes (one book dealing with the Arrow theorem
invites the reader to consider the related problem of creating a scalar measure
for the track and field decathlon eventâ€”e.g. how does one make scoring 600
points in the discus event "commensurable" with scoring 600 points in the
1500Â m race) and this scalar ranking can depend sensitively on the weighting
of different attributes, with the tacit weighting itself affected by the
context and contrast created by apparently "irrelevant" choices. Edward MacNeal
discusses this sensitivity problem with respect to the ranking of "most livable
city" in the chapter "Surveys" of his book "MathSemantics: making numbers talk
sense" (1994). Other possibilities. In an attempt to escape from the negative
conclusion of Arrow's theorem, social choice theorists have investigated
various possibilities ("ways out"). Approaches investigating functions of
preference profiles. This section includes approaches that deal with Since
these two approaches often overlap, we discuss them at the same time. What is
characteristic of these approaches is that they investigate various
possibilities by eliminating or weakening or replacing one or more conditions
(criteria) that Arrow imposed. Infinitely many individuals. Several theorists
(e.g., Kirman and Sondermann, 1972) point out that when one drops the
assumption that there are only finitely many individuals, one can find
aggregation rules that satisfy all of Arrow's other conditions. However, such
aggregation rules are practically of limited interest, since they are based on
ultrafilters, highly nonconstructive mathematical objects. In particular,
Kirman and Sondermann argue that there is an "invisible dictator" behind such a
rule. Mihara (1997, 1999) shows that such a rule violates algorithmic
computability. These results can be seen to establish the robustness of Arrow's
theorem. Limiting the number of alternatives. When there are only two
alternatives to choose from, May's theorem shows that only simple majority rule
satisfies a certain set of criteria (e.g., equal treatment of individuals and
of alternatives; increased support for a winning alternative should not make it
into a losing one). On the other hand, when there are at least three
alternatives, Arrow's theorem points out the difficulty of collective decision
making. Why is there such a sharp difference between the case of less than
three alternatives and that of at least three alternatives? "Nakamura's
theorem" (about the core of simple games) gives an answer more generally. It
establishes that if the number of alternatives is less than a certain integer
called the Nakamura number, then the rule in question will identify "best"
alternatives without any problem; if the number of alternatives is greater or
equal to the Nakamura number, then the rule will not always work, since for
some profile a voting paradox (a cycle such as alternative A socially preferred
to alternative B, B to C, and C to A) will arise. Since the Nakamura number of
majority rule is 3 (except the case of four individuals), one can conclude from
Nakamura's theorem that majority rule can deal with up to two alternatives
rationally. Some super-majority rules (such as those requiring 2/3 of the
votes) can have a Nakamura number greater than 3, but such rules violate other
conditions given by Arrow. Remark. A common way "around" Arrow's paradox is
limiting the alternative set to two alternatives. Thus, whenever more than two
alternatives should be put to the test, it seems very tempting to use a
mechanism that pairs them and votes by pairs. As tempting as this mechanism
seems at first glance, it is generally far from satisfying even Pareto
efficiency, not to mention IIA. The specific order by which the pairs are
decided strongly influences the outcome. This is not necessarily a bad feature
of the mechanism. Many sports use the tournament mechanismâ€”essentially a
pairing mechanismâ€”to choose a winner. This gives considerable opportunity for
weaker teams to win, thus adding interest and tension throughout the
tournament. This means that the person controlling the order by which the
choices are paired (the agenda maker) has great control over the outcome. In
any case, when viewing the entire voting process as one game, Arrow's theorem
still applies. Domain restrictions. Another approach is relaxing the
universality condition, which means restricting the domain of aggregation
rules. The best-known result along this line assumes "single peaked"
preferences. Duncan Black has shown that if there is only one dimension on
which every individual has a "single-peaked" preference, then all of Arrow's
conditions are met by majority rule. Suppose that there is some predetermined
linear ordering of the alternative set. An individual's preference is "single-
peaked" with respect to this ordering if he has some special place that he
likes best along that line, and his dislike for an alternative grows larger as
the alternative goes further away from that spot (i.e., the graph of his
utility function has a single peak if alternatives are placed according to the
linear ordering on the horizontal axis). For example, if voters were voting on
where to set the volume for music, it would be reasonable to assume that each
voter had their own ideal volume preference and that as the volume got
progressively too loud or too quiet they would be increasingly dissatisfied. If
the domain is restricted to profiles in which every individual has a single
peaked preference with respect to the linear ordering, then "simple" ()
aggregation rules, which includes majority rule, have an "acyclic" (defined
below) social preference, hence "best" alternatives. In particular, when there
are odd number of individuals, then the social preference becomes transitive,
and the socially "best" alternative is equal to the median of all the peaks of
the individuals (Black's median voter theorem). Under single-peaked
preferences, the majority rule is in some respects the most natural voting
mechanism. One can define the notion of "single-peaked" preferences on higher
dimensional sets of alternatives. However, one can identify the "median" of the
peaks only in exceptional cases. Instead, we typically have the destructive
situation suggested by McKelvey's Chaos Theorem for any "x" and "y", one can
find a sequence of alternatives such that "x" is beaten by formula_24 by a
majority, formula_24 by formula_26, formula_27, formula_28 by "y". Relaxing
transitivity. By relaxing the transitivity of social preferences, we can find
aggregation rules that satisfy Arrow's other conditions. If we impose
"neutrality" (equal treatment of alternatives) on such rules, however, there
exists an individual who has a "veto". So the possibility provided by this
approach is also very limited. First, suppose that a social preference is
"quasi-transitive" (instead of transitive); if formula_30 and formula_31, then
formula_32. Then, there do exist non-dictatorial aggregation rules satisfying
Arrow's conditions, but such rules are "oligarchic" (Gibbard, 1969). This means
that there exists a coalition L such that L is "decisive" (if every member in L
prefers x to y, then the society prefers x to y), and each member in L "has a
veto" (if she prefers x to y, then the society cannot prefer y to x). there
does not exist alternatives formula_33 that form a "cycle" (formula_34,
formula_35, formula_27, formula_37, formula_38). Then, provided that there are
at least as many alternatives as individuals, an aggregation rule satisfying
Arrow's other conditions is "collegial" (Brown, 1975). This means that there
are individuals who belong to the intersection ("collegium") of all decisive
coalitions. If there is someone who has a veto, then he belongs to the
collegium. If the rule is assumed to be neutral, then it does have someone who
has a veto. Finally, Brown's theorem left open the case of acyclic social
preferences where the number of alternatives is less than the number of
individuals. One can give a definite answer for that case using the "Nakamura
number". See #Limiting the number of alternatives. Relaxing IIA. There are
numerous examples of aggregation rules satisfying Arrow's conditions except
IIA. The Borda rule is one of them. These rules, however, are susceptible to
"strategic manipulation" by individuals (Blair and Muller, 1983). See also
Interpretations of the theorem above. Relaxing the Pareto criterion. Wilson
(1972) shows that if an aggregation rule is non-imposed and non-null, then
there is either a dictator or an inverse dictator, provided that Arrow's
conditions other than Pareto are also satisfied. Here, an "inverse dictator" is
an individual i such that whenever i prefers x to y, then the society prefers y
to x. Remark. Amartya Sen offered both relaxation of transitivity and removal
of the Pareto principle. He demonstrated another interesting impossibility
result, known as the "impossibility of the Paretian Liberal". (See liberal
paradox for details). Sen went on to argue that this demonstrates the futility
of demanding Pareto optimality in relation to voting mechanisms. Social choice
instead of social preference. In social decision making, to rank all
alternatives is not usually a goal. It often suffices to find some alternative.
The approach focusing on choosing an alternative investigates either "social
choice functions" (functions that map each preference profile into an
alternative) or "social choice rules" (functions that map each preference
profile into a subset of alternatives). As for social choice functions, the
Gibbardâ€“Satterthwaite theorem is well-known, which states that if a social
choice function whose range contains at least three alternatives is strategy-
proof, then it is dictatorial. As for social choice rules, we should assume
there is a social preference behind them. That is, we should regard a rule as
choosing the maximal elements ("best" alternatives) of some social preference.
The set of maximal elements of a social preference is called the "core".
Conditions for existence of an alternative in the core have been investigated
in two approaches. The first approach assumes that preferences are at least
"acyclic" (which is necessary and sufficient for the preferences to have a
maximal element on any "finite" subset). For this reason, it is closely related
to #Relaxing transitivity. The second approach drops the assumption of acyclic
preferences. Kumabe and Mihara (2011) adopt this approach. They make a more
direct assumption that individual preferences have maximal elements, and
examine conditions for the social preference to have a maximal element. See
Nakamura number for details of these two approaches. Rated voting systems and
other approaches. Arrow's framework assumes that individual and social
preferences are "orderings" (i.e., satisfy completeness and transitivity) on
the set of alternatives. This means that if the preferences are represented by
a utility function, its value is an "ordinal" utility in the sense that it is
meaningful so far as the greater value indicates the better alternative. For
instance, having ordinal utilities of 4, 3, 2, 1 for alternatives a, b, c, d,
respectively, is the same as having 1000, 100.01, 100, 0, which in turn is the
same as having 99, 98, 1, .997. They all represent the ordering in which a is
preferred to b to c to d. The assumption of "ordinal" preferences, which
precludes "interpersonal comparisons" of utility, is an integral part of
Arrow's theorem. For various reasons, an approach based on "cardinal" utility,
where the utility has a meaning beyond just giving a ranking of alternatives,
is not common in contemporary economics. However, once one adopts that
approach, one can take intensities of preferences into consideration, or one
can compare (i) gains and losses of utility or (ii) levels of utility, across
different individuals. In particular, Harsanyi (1955) gives a justification of
utilitarianism (which evaluates alternatives in terms of the sum of individual
utilities), originating from Jeremy Bentham. Hammond (1976) gives a
justification of the maximin principle (which evaluates alternatives in terms
of the utility of the worst-off individual), originating from John Rawls. Not
all voting methods use, as input, only an ordering of all candidates. Methods
which don't, often called "rated" or "cardinal" (as opposed to "ranked",
"ordinal", or "preferential") voting systems, can be viewed as using
information that only "cardinal" utility can convey. In that case, it is not
surprising if some of them satisfy all of Arrow's conditions that are
reformulated. Range voting is such a method. Whether such a claim is correct
depends on how each condition is reformulated. Other rated voting systems which
pass certain generalizations of Arrow's criteria include Approval voting and
Majority Judgment. Note that although Arrow's theorem does not apply to such
methods, the Gibbardâ€“Satterthwaite theorem still does: no system is fully
strategy-free, so the informal dictum that "no voting system is perfect" still
has a mathematical basis. Finally, though not an approach investigating some
kind of rules, there is a criticism by James M. Buchanan and others. It argues
that it is silly to think that there might be "social" preferences that are
analogous to "individual" preferences. Arrow (1963, Chapter 8) answers this
sort of criticisms seen in the early period, which come at least partly from
misunderstanding.
