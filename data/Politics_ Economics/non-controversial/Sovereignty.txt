Sovereignty Sovereignty is the quality of having supreme, independent authority
over a geographic area, such as a territory. It can be found in a power to rule
and make law that rests on a political fact for which no pure legal definition
can be provided. In theoretical terms, the idea of "sovereignty", historically,
from Socrates to Thomas Hobbes, has always necessitated a moral imperative on
the entity exercising it. For centuries past, the idea that a state could be
sovereign was always connected to its ability to guarantee the best interests
of its own citizens. Thus, if a state could not act in the best interests of
its own citizens, it could not be thought of as a ‚Äúsovereign‚Äù state. Often,
these four aspects all appear together, but this is not necessarily the case
‚Äì they are not affected by one another, and there are historical examples of
states that were non-sovereign in one aspect while at the same time being
sovereign in another of these aspects. History. Classical. Ulpian was
expressing the idea that the Emperor exercised a rather absolute form of
sovereignty, although he did not use the term expressly. Ulpian's statements
were known in medieval Europe, but sovereignty was not an important concept in
medieval times. Medieval monarchs were "not" sovereign, at least not strongly
so, because they were constrained by, and shared power with, their feudal
aristocracy. Furthermore, both were strongly constrained by custom. Medieval.
Sovereignty existed during the Medieval Period as the de jure rights of
nobility and royalty, and in the de facto capability of individuals to make
their own choices in life. In medieval times, sovereignty was seen as
absoluteness of the state; this is according to Thomas Hobbes in his
text,"Leviathan". Around c. 1380‚Äì1400, the issue of feminine sovereignty was
addressed in Geoffrey Chaucer's Middle English collection of "Canterbury
Tales", specifically in "The Wife of Bath's Tale." A later English Arthurian
romance, "The Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnell" (c. 1450), uses much of
the same elements of the Wife of Bath's tale, yet changes the setting to the
court of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. The story revolves
around the knight Sir Gawain granting to Dame Ragnell, his new bride, what is
purported to be wanted most by women: sovereignty. Reformation. Bodin rejected
the notion of transference of sovereignty from people to sovereign; natural law
and divine law confer upon the sovereign the right to rule. And the sovereign
is not above divine law or natural law. He is above ("ie." not bound by) only
positive law, that is, laws made by humans. The fact that the sovereign must
obey divine and natural law imposes ethical constraints on him. Bodin also held
that the "lois royales", the fundamental laws of the French monarchy which
regulated matters such as succession, are natural laws and are binding on the
French sovereign. How divine and natural law could in practice be enforced on
the sovereign is a problematic feature of Bodin's philosophy: any person
capable of enforcing them on him would be above him. Despite his commitment to
absolutism, Bodin held some moderate opinions on how government should in
practice be carried out. He held that although the sovereign is not obliged to,
it is advisable for him, as a practical expedient, to convene a senate from
whom he can obtain advice, to delegate some power to magistrates for the
practical administration of the law, and to use the Estates as a means of
communicating with the people. With his doctrine that sovereignty is conferred
by divine law, Bodin predefined the scope of the divine right of kings. Age of
Enlightenment. During the Age of Enlightenment, the idea of sovereignty gained
both legal and moral force as the main Western description of the meaning and
power of a State. In particular, the "Social Contract" as a mechanism for
establishing sovereignty was suggested and, by 1800, widely accepted,
especially in the new United States and France, though also in Great Britain to
a lesser extent. Hobbes' hypothesis that the ruler's sovereignty is contracted
to him by the people in return for his maintaining their physical safety, led
him to conclude that if and when the ruler fails, the people recover their
ability to protect themselves, including by forming a new contract. Hobbes's
theories decisively shape the concept of sovereignty through the medium of
social contract theories. Jean-Jacques Rousseau's (1712‚Äì1778) definition of
popular sovereignty (with early antecedents in Francisco Su√°rez's theory of
the origin of power), which only differs in that he considers the people to be
the legitimate sovereign. Likewise, it is inalienable ‚Äì Rousseau condemned
the distinction between the origin and the exercise of sovereignty, a
distinction upon which constitutional monarchy or representative democracy are
founded. John Locke, and Montesquieu are also key figures in the unfolding of
the concept of sovereignty, and differ with Rousseau and with Hobbes on this
issue of alienability. The second book of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's "Du Contrat
Social, ou Principes du droit politique" (1762) deals with sovereignty and its
rights. Sovereignty, or the general will, is inalienable, for the will cannot
be transmitted; it is indivisible, since it is essentially general; it is
infallible and always right, determined and limited in its power by the common
interest; it acts through laws. Law is the decision of the general will in
regard to some object of common interest, but though the general will is always
right and desires only good, its judgment is not always enlightened, and
consequently does not always see wherein the common good lies; hence the
necessity of the legislator. But the legislator has, of himself, no authority;
he is only a guide who drafts and proposes laws, but the people alone (that is,
the sovereign or general will) has authority to make and impose them. Rousseau,
in his 1763 treatise "Of the Social Contract" argued, "the growth of the State
giving the trustees of public authority more and means to abuse their power,
the more the Government has to have force to contain the people, the more force
the Sovereign should have in turn in order to contain the Government," with the
understanding that the Sovereign is "a collective being of wonder" (Book II,
Chapter I) resulting from "the general will" of the people, and that "what any
man, whoever he may be, orders on his own, is not a law" (Book II, Chapter VI)
‚Äì and furthermore predicated on the assumption that the people have an
unbiased means by which to ascertain the general will. Thus the legal maxim,
"there is no law without a sovereign." Definition and types. Absoluteness. An
important factor of sovereignty is its degree of absoluteness. A sovereign
power has absolute sovereignty when it is not restricted by a constitution, by
the laws of its predecessors, or by custom, and no areas of law or policy are
reserved as being outside its control. International law; policies and actions
of neighboring states; cooperation and respect of the populace; means of
enforcement; and resources to enact policy are factors that might limit
sovereignty. For example, parents are not guaranteed the right to decide some
matters in the upbringing of their children independent of societal regulation,
and municipalities do not have unlimited jurisdiction in local matters, thus
neither parents nor municipalities have absolute sovereignty. Theorists have
diverged over the desirability of increased absoluteness. Exclusivity. A key
element of sovereignty in a legalistic sense is that of exclusivity of
jurisdiction. Specifically, the degree to which decisions made by a sovereign
entity might be contradicted by another authority. Along these lines, the
German sociologist Max Weber proposed that sovereignty is a community's
monopoly on the legitimate use of force; and thus any group claiming the same
right must either be brought under the yoke of the sovereign, proven
illegitimate, or otherwise contested and defeated for sovereignty to be
genuine. International law, competing branches of government, and authorities
reserved for subordinate entities (such as federated states or republics)
represent legal infringements on exclusivity. Social institutions such as
religious bodies, corporations, and competing political parties might represent
de facto infringements on exclusivity. De jure and de facto. De jure, or legal,
sovereignty concerns the expressed and institutionally recognised right to
exercise control over a territory. De facto, or actual, sovereignty is
concerned with whether control in fact exists. Cooperation and respect of the
populace; control of resources in, or moved into, an area; means of enforcement
and security; and ability to carry out various functions of state all represent
measures of de facto sovereignty. When control is practiced predominately by
military or police force it is considered "coercive sovereignty". It is
generally held that sovereignty requires not only the legal right to exercise
power, but the actual exercise of such power. Thus, de jure sovereignty without
de facto sovereignty has limited recognition. Internal. Internal sovereignty is
the relationship between a sovereign power and its own subjects. A central
concern is legitimacy: by what right does a government exercise authority?
Claims of legitimacy might refer to the divine right of kings or to a social
contract (i.e. popular sovereignty). With Sovereignty meaning holding supreme,
independent authority over a region or state, Internal Sovereignty refers to
the internal affairs of the state and the location of supreme power within it.
A state that has internal sovereignty is one with a government that has been
elected by the people and has the popular legitimacy. Internal sovereignty
examines the internal affairs of a state and how it operates. It is important
to have strong internal sovereignty in relation to keeping order and peace.
When you have weak internal sovereignty organization such as rebel groups will
undermine the authority and disrupt the peace. The presence of a strong
authority allows you to keep agreement and enforce sanctions for the violation
of laws. The ability for leadership to prevent these violations is a key
variable in determining internal sovereignty. The lack of internal sovereignty
can cause war in one of two ways, first, undermining the value of agreement by
allowing costly violations and second requiring such large subsidies for
implementation that they render war cheaper than peace. Leadership needs to be
able to promise members, especially those like armies, police forces, or
paramilitaries will abide by agreements. The presence of strong internal
sovereignty allows a state to deter opposition groups in exchange for
bargaining. It has been said that a more decentralized authority would be more
efficient in keeping peace because the deal must please not only the leadership
but also the opposition group. While the operations and affairs within a state
are relative to the level of sovereignty within that state, there is still an
argument between who should hold the authority in a sovereign state. This
argument between who should hold the authority within a sovereign state is
called the traditional doctrine of public sovereignty. This discussion is
between an internal sovereign or an authority of public sovereignty. An
internal sovereign is a political body that possesses ultimate, final and
independent authority; one whose decisions are binding upon all citizens,
groups and institutions in society. Early thinkers believe sovereignty should
be vested in the hands of a single person, a monarch. They believed the
overriding merit of vesting sovereignty in a single individual was that
sovereignty would therefore be indivisible; it would be expressed in a single
voice that could claim final authority. An example of an internal sovereign or
monarch is Louis XIV of France during the seventeenth century; Louis XIV
claimed that he was the state. Jean-Jacques Rousseau rejected monarchial rule
in favor of the other type of authority within a sovereign state, public
sovereignty. Public Sovereignty is the belief that ultimate authority is vested
in the people themselves, expressed in the idea of the general will. This means
that the power is elected and supported by its members, the authority has a
central goal of the good of the people in mind. The idea of public sovereignty
has often been the basis for modern democratic theory. Within the modern
governmental system you usually find internal sovereignty in states that have
public sovereignty and rarely find it within a state controlled by an internal
sovereign. A form of government that is a little different from both is the UK
parliament system. From 1790‚Äì1859 it was argued that sovereignty in the UK
was vested neither in the Crown nor in the people but in the "Monarch in
Parliament". This is the origin of the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty
and is usually seen as the fundamental principle of the British constitution.
With these principles of parliamentary sovereignty majority control can gain
access to unlimited constitutional authority, creating what has been called
"elective dictatorship" or "modern autocracy". Public sovereignty in modern
governments is a lot more common with examples like the USA, Canada, Australia
and India where government is divided into different levels. External. External
sovereignty concerns the relationship between a sovereign power and other
states. For example, the United Kingdom uses the following criterion when
deciding under what conditions other states recognise a political entity as
having sovereignty over some territory; External sovereignty is connected with
questions of international law, such as: when, if ever, is intervention by one
country onto another's territory permissible? Following the Thirty Years' War,
an European religious conflict that embroiled much of the continent, the Peace
of Westphalia in 1648 established the notion of territorial sovereignty as a
norm of noninterference in the affairs of other nations, so-called Westphalian
sovereignty, even though the actual treaty itself reaffirmed the multiple
levels of sovereignty of the Holy Roman Empire. This resulted as a natural
extension of the older principle of "cuius regio, eius religio" (Whose realm,
his religion), leaving the Roman Catholic Church with little ability to
interfere with the internal affairs of many European states. It is a myth,
however, that the Treaties of Westphalia created a new European order of equal
sovereign states. In international law, sovereignty means that a government
possesses full control over affairs within a territorial or geographical area
or limit. Determining whether a specific entity is sovereign is not an exact
science, but often a matter of diplomatic dispute. There is usually an
expectation that both de jure and de facto sovereignty rest in the same
organisation at the place and time of concern. Foreign governments use varied
criteria and political considerations when deciding whether or not to recognise
the sovereignty of a state over a territory. Membership in the United Nations
requires that "he admission of any such state to membership in the United
Nations will be effected by a decision of the General Assembly upon the
recommendation of the Security Council." Sovereignty may be recognized even
when the sovereign body possesses no territory or its territory is under
partial or total occupation by another power. The Holy See was in this position
between the annexation in 1870 of the Papal States by Italy and the signing of
the Lateran Treaties in 1929, a 59-year period during which it was recognised
as sovereign by many (mostly Roman Catholic) states despite possessing no
territory ‚Äì a situation resolved when the Lateran Treaties granted the Holy
See sovereignty over the Vatican City. Another case, "sui generis", is the
Sovereign Military Order of Malta, the third sovereign entity inside Italian
territory (after San Marino and the Vatican City State) and the second inside
the Italian capital (since in 1869 the Palazzo di Malta and the Villa Malta
receive extraterritorial rights, in this way becoming the only "sovereign"
territorial possessions of the modern Order), which is the last existing heir
to one of several once militarily significant, crusader states of sovereign
military orders. In 1607 its Grand masters were also made Reichsf√ºrst (princes
of the Holy Roman Empire) by the Holy Roman Emperor, granting them seats in the
Reichstag, at the time the closest permanent equivalent to a UN-type general
assembly; confirmed 1620). These sovereign rights never deposed, only the
territories were lost. 100 modern states still maintain full diplomatic
relations with the order (now de facto "the most prestigious service club"),
and the UN awarded it observer status. The governments-in-exile of many
European states (for instance, Norway, Netherlands or Czechoslovakia) during
the Second World War were regarded as sovereign despite their territories being
under foreign occupation; their governance resumed as soon as the occupation
had ended. The government of Kuwait was in a similar situation "vis-√ -vis" the
Iraqi occupation of its country during 1990‚Äì1991. The government of Republic
of China was recognized as sovereign over China from 1911-1971 despite that its
mainland China territory became occupied by Communist Chinese forces since
1949. In 1971 it lost UN recognition to Chinese Communist-led People's Republic
of China and its sovereign and political status as a state became disputed and
it lost its ability to use "China" as its name and therefore became commonly
known as Taiwan. Commonly mistaken to be sovereign, the International Committee
of the Red Cross, having been granted various degrees of special privileges and
legal immunities in many countries, that in cases like Switzerland are
considerable, which are described as amounting to de facto sovereignty, is a
private organisation governed by Swiss law. Shared. Just as the office of head
of state can be vested jointly in several persons within a state, the sovereign
jurisdiction over a single political territory can be shared jointly by two or
more consenting powers, notably in the form of a condominium. Nation-states. A
community of people who claim the right of self-determination based on a common
ethnicity, history and culture might seek to establish sovereignty over a
region, thus creating a nation-state. Such nations are sometimes recognised as
autonomous areas rather than as fully sovereign, independent states.
Federations. In a federal system of government, "sovereignty" also refers to
powers which a constituent state or republic possesses independently of the
national government. In a confederation constituent entities retain the right
to withdraw from the national body, but in a federation member states or
republics do not hold that right. Different interpretations of state
sovereignty in the United States of America, as it related to the expansion of
slavery and Fugitive slave laws, led to the outbreak of the American Civil War.
Depending on the particular issue, sometimes the North and other times the
South justified their political positions by appealing to state sovereignty.
Fearing that slavery would be threatened by federal election results, eleven
states declared their independence from the federal Union and formed a new
confederation. The United States government rejected the secessions as
rebellion, declaring that secession from the Union by an individual state was
unconstitutional, as the states were part of an indissolvable federation.
Acquisition. A number of methods of acquisition of sovereignty are presently or
have historically been recognised by international law as lawful methods by
which a state may acquire sovereignty over territory. Justifications. There
exist vastly differing views on the moral basis of sovereignty. A fundamental
polarity is between theories that assert that sovereignty is vested directly in
the sovereign by divine or natural right and theories that assert it originates
from the people. In the latter case there is a further division into those that
assert that the people transfer their sovereignty to the sovereign (Hobbes),
and those that assert that the people retain their sovereignty (Rousseau).
During the brief period of Absolute monarchies in Europe, the divine right of
kings was an important competing justification for the exercise of sovereignty.
The Mandate of Heaven had some similar implications in China. A republic is a
form of government in which the people, or some significant portion of them,
retain sovereignty over the government and where offices of state are not
granted through heritage. A common modern definition of a republic is a
government having a head of state who is not a monarch. Democracy is based on
the concept of "popular sovereignty". In a direct democracy the public plays an
active role in shaping and deciding policy. Representative democracy permits a
transfer of the exercise of sovereignty from the people to a legislative body
or an executive (or to some combination of legislature, executive and
Judiciary). Many representative democracies provide limited direct democracy
through referendum, initiative, and recall. Parliamentary sovereignty refers to
a representative democracy where the parliament is ultimately sovereign and not
the executive power nor the judiciary. Relation to rule of law. Another topic
is whether the law is held to be sovereign, that is, whether it is above
political or other interference. Sovereign law constitutes a true state of law,
meaning the letter of the law (if constitutionally correct) is applicable and
enforceable, even when against the political will of the nation, as long as not
formally changed following the constitutional procedure. Strictly speaking, any
deviation from this principle constitutes a revolution or a coup d'√©tat,
regardless of the intentions. Sovereign as a title. In some cases, the title
sovereign is not just a generic term, but an actual (part of the) formal style
of a Head of state. Thus from 22 June 1934, to 29 May 1953, (the title "Emperor
of India" was dropped as of 15 August 1947, by retroactive proclamation dated
22 June 1948), the King of South Africa was styled in the Dominion of South
Africa: "By the Grace of God, of Great Britain, Ireland and of the British
Dominions beyond the Seas King, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India and
"Sovereign" in and over the Union of South Africa." Upon the accession of
Elizabeth II to the Throne of South Africa in 1952, the title was changed to
Queen of South Africa and Her other Realms and Territories, Head of the
Commonwealth, parallel to the style used in almost all the other Commonwealth
realms. The pope holds ex officio the title "Sovereign of the Vatican City
State" in respect to Vatican City. The adjective form can also be used in a
Monarch's full style, as in pre-imperial Russia, 16 January 1547 ‚Äì 22
November 1721: "Bozhiyeyu Milostiyu Velikiy/Velikaya Gosudar'/Gosudarynya
Tsar'/Tsaritsa i Velikiy/Velikaya Knyaz'/Knyaginya N.N. vseya Rossiy
Samodyerzhets" "By the Grace of God Great Sovereign Tsar/Tsarina and Grand
Prince/Princess, N.N., of All Russia, Autocrat".
