Illegal drug trade The illegal drug trade is a global black market, dedicated
to cultivation, manufacturing, distribution, and sale of drugs, which are
subject to drug prohibition laws. Most jurisdictions prohibit trade, except
under license, of many types of drugs by drug prohibition laws. A UN report
said "the global drug trade generated an estimated US$321.6 billion in 2003."
With a world GDP of US$36 trillion in the same year, the illegal drug trade may
be estimated as slightly less than 1% (0.893%) of total global commerce.
Consumption of illegal drugs is widespread globally. History. Addictive drugs
were first prohibited in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. An Illegal
Drug Trade emerged during the 19th century; China retaliated with imports of
opium, and two Opium Wars broke out. In the First Opium War, the Chinese
authorities had banned opium, but the United Kingdom forced China to allow
British merchants to trade opium with the general population. Smoking opium had
become common in the 19th century, and British merchants increased their trade
with the Chinese. Trading in opium was (as it is today in the heroin trade)
extremely lucrative. As a result of this illegal trade, an estimated two
million Chinese people became addicted to the drug. The British Crown (via the
treaties of Nanking and Tianjin) took vast sums of money from the Chinese
government through this illegal trade, which they referred to as "reparations".
Legal penalties. In many countries, drug smuggling carries severe penalties.
These include lengthy periods of incarceration, flogging, and even the death
penalty (in Singapore, Malaysia, etc.). In December 2005, a 25 year old
Australian drug smuggler was hanged in Singapore. In 2010, two people were
sentenced to death in Malaysia for trafficking 1 kilogram/2.2 pounds of
cannabis into the country. Drug trafficking is widely regarded as the most
serious of drug offences around the world. However, sentencing often depends on
the type of drug (and its classification in the country into which it is being
trafficked), the quantity trafficked, where the drugs are sold and how they are
distributed; for example if the drugs are sold to underage people, then the
penalties for trafficking may be harsher than in other circumstances. Effects
of illegal drug trade on societies. The countries of drug production have been
seen as the worst affected by prohibition. Even so, countries receiving the
illegally-imported substances are also affected by problems stemming from drug
prohibition. For example, Ecuador has allegedly absorbed up to 300,000 refugees
from Colombia who are running from guerrillas, paramilitaries and drug lords,
says Linda Helfrich. While some applied for asylum, others are still illegal,
and the drugs that pass from Colombia through Ecuador to other parts of South
America create economic and social problems. Violent crime. In many countries
worldwide, the illegal drug trade is thought to be directly linked to violent
crimes such as murder; this is especially true in third world countries, but is
also an issue for many developed countries worldwide. In the late 1990s in the
United States the Federal Bureau of Investigation estimated that 5% of murders
were drug-related. After a crackdown by U.S. and Mexican authorities in the
first decade of the 21st century as part of tightened border security in the
wake of the September 11 attacks, border violence inside Mexico surged. The
Mexican government estimates that 90% of the killings are drug-related. A
report by the UK government's drug strategy unit that was subsequently leaked
to the press, stated that due to the expensive price of highly addictive drugs
heroin and cocaine, that drug use was responsible for the great majority of
crime, including 85% for shoplifting, 70-80% of burglaries and 54% of
robberies. "The cost of crime committed to support illegal cocaine and heroin
habits amounts to Â£16 billion a year in the UK" (note: this is more than the
entire annual UK Home Office budget). Profits. Due to its illicit nature,
statistics about profits from the drug trade are largely unknown. In its 1997
World Drugs Report the UNODC estimated the value of the market at US$400
billion, ranking drugs alongside arms and oil amongst the world's largest
traded goods. An online report published by the UK Home Office in 2007
estimated the illicit drug market in the UK at Â£4â€“6.6 billion a year In
December 2009, the United Nations' Drugs and Crime Tsar Antonio Maria Costa
claimed that illegal drug money saved the banking industry from collapse. He
claimed he had seen evidence that the proceeds of organised crime were "the
only liquid investment capital" available to some banks on the brink of
collapse during 2008. He said that a majority of the US$352bn (Â£216bn) of
drugs profits was absorbed into the economic system as a result. "In many
instances, the money from drugs was the only liquid investment capital. In the
second half of 2008, liquidity was the banking system's main problem and hence
liquid capital became an important factor...Inter-bank loans were funded by
money that originated from the drugs trade and other illegal activities...
There were signs that some banks were rescued that way". Costa declined to
identify countries or banks that may have received any drug money, saying that
would be inappropriate because his office is supposed to address the problem,
not apportion blame. Illegal cocaine trade via West Africa. Cocaine produced in
Colombia, Venezuela and Bolivia has been increasingly shipped via West Africa
(Guinea, Guinea-Bissau and Liberia). The money is often laundered in countries
as Nigeria, Ghana and Senegal. Cargo planes are now also used as a method of
transport from the production countries to West-Africa. Before this, the
cocaine was only shipped to the USA. Because the market became saturated there,
illicit drug traders decided to increase shipping to Europe. When these new
drug routes were uncovered by the authorities, West Africa was chosen as a
stop-over. In 2005, the first major cocaine shipment was intercepted by the
police. In 2007, 30% of all cocaine shipped to the UK was estimated to come
from West Africa. In 2009, 50% of all cocaine shipped to the UK was estimated
to come from West Africa. Drug mules, fishing boats, container ships, and
submarines have been used to transship illegal drugs from West Africa to
Europe. Especially in Guinea-Bissau, the drugs have been traded with the help
of political leaders such as former presidents, the son of dictator Lansana
ContÃ©, and chiefs of staff of the army. According to the UN, the value of
illicit drug smuggling in Guinea-Bissau is higher than the value of the
country's GDP. Policemen are often bribed. A policeman's normal monthly wage of
75 â‚¬ is less than 2% of the value of 1 kilogram of cocaine (7000 â‚¬). The
money can also be laundered using real estate. A house is built using illegal
funds, and when the house is sold, legal money is earned. Inexpensive illicit
drugs, such as crack, are now in distribution. This decreases the economic
productivity and diminishes any safety goal for the intended end user. When
drugs are sent overland, through the Sahara, the drug traders have been
increasingly forced to cooperate with terrorist organisations, such as Al Qaida
in Islamic Maghreb. Trade of specific drugs. Cannabis. While the recreational
use of (and consequently the distribution of) cannabis is illegal in most
countries throughout the world, it is available by prescription or
recommendation in many places, including some US states and in Canada. Cannabis
use is tolerated in some areas, most notably the Netherlands which has
legalized the possession and licensed sale (but not production) of the drug.
Many nations have decriminalized the possession of small amounts of marijuana.
Due to the hardy nature of the Cannabis plant, marijuana is grown all across
the world and is today the world's most popular illegal drug with the highest
availability. Cannabis is grown legally in many countries for industrial, non-
drug use (known as hemp) as well. Cannabis-Hemp may also be planted for other
non-drug domestic purposes such as seasoning in Aceh. The demand for cannabis
around the world, coupled with the drug's relative ease of cultivation, makes
the illicit cannabis trade one of the primary ways in which organized criminal
groups finance many of their activities. In Mexico, for example, the illicit
trafficking of cannabis is thought to constitute the majority of many of the
cartels' earnings. and thus the main way in which they (the cartels) finance
many other illegal activities ranging from the purchase of other illegal drugs
for trafficking and weapons that are ultimately used to commit murders (causing
a burgeoning in the homicide rates of many areas of the world, but particularly
Latin America). Tobacco. While the purchase and use of tobacco is legal for
adults in most countries throughout the world, heavy taxation in some countries
such as the United Kingdom has resulted in an extensive market for its illegal
trade. Tobacco products such as name-brand cigarettes may be sold as low as one
third of the retail price because of the lack of taxes which would be imposed
throughout the legal distribution process. It was estimated in 2004 that
smuggling a single truck containing up to 48,000 cartons of cigarettes from
Virginia to New York in the United States could lead to a profit of around US$2
million. The source of the illegally-traded tobacco is often the proceeds from
other crimes, such as store and transportation robberies. A notable exception
to the legal status of tobacco in most countries internationally is the kingdom
of Bhutan, which made the sale of tobacco illegal in December 2004, and since
this event, a large supply of tobacco has been made available on the black
market. In 2006, tobacco and betel nut were the most commonly seized illicit
drugs in Bhutan. Heroin. Up until around 2004 the majority of the world's
heroin was produced in an area known as the Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia).
In 2008 Afghanistan was by a very wide margin "the world's largest exporter of
heroin". In 2007, 93% of the opiates on the world market originated in
Afghanistan. This amounts to an export value of about US$64 billion, with a
quarter being earned by opium farmers and the rest going to district officials,
insurgents, warlords and drug traffickers. Another significant area where poppy
fields are grown for the manufacture of heroin is Mexico. According to the
United States Drug Enforcement Administration, the price of heroin is typically
valued 8 to 10 times that of cocaine on American streets, making it a high-
profit substance for smugglers and dealers. In Europe (except the transit
countries Portugal and the Netherlands), for example, a purported gram of
street heroin, usually consisting of 700â€“800Â mg of a light to dark brown
powder containing 5-10% heroin base, costs between 30 and 70 euros, making the
effective value per gram of pure heroin between 300 and 700 euros. Heroin is
generally a preferred target for smuggling and distribution over unrefined
opium due to the cost-effectiveness and increased efficacy of heroin. Because
of the high cost per volume, heroin is easily smuggled. A quarter-sized vial
can contain hundreds of doses. From the 1930s to the early 1970s, the so-called
French Connection supplied the majority of US demand. Allegedly, during the
Vietnam War, drug lords such as Ike Atkinson used to smuggle hundreds of kilos
of heroin to the U.S. in coffins of dead American soldiers (see Cadaver
Connection). Since that time it has become more difficult for drugs to be
imported into the United States than it had been in previous decades, but that
does not stop the heroin smugglers from getting their product onto U.S. soil.
Purity levels vary greatly by region with, for the most part, Northeastern
cities having the most pure heroin in the United States. (According to a
recently released report by the DEA, Camden and Newark, New Jersey and
Philadelphia, have the purest street grade A heroin in the country.) Penalties
for smuggling heroin and/or morphine are often harsh in most countries. Some
countries will readily hand down a death sentence (e.g. Singapore) or life in
prison for the illegal smuggling of heroin or morphine, which are both,
internationally, Schedule I drugs under the Single Convention on Narcotic
Drugs. Methamphetamine. Methamphetamine is another popular drug among
distributors. Three common street names are "crystal meth", "meth", and "ice".
According to the Community Epidemiology Work Group, the numbers of clandestine
methamphetamine laboratory incidents reported to the National Clandestine
Laboratory Database decreased from 1999 to 2009. During this same period,
methamphetamine lab incidents increased in midwestern States (Illinois,
Michigan, Missouri, and Ohio), and in Pennsylvania. In 2004, more lab incidents
were reported in Missouri (2,788) and Illinois (1,058) than in California
(764). In 2003, methamphetamine lab incidents reached new highs in Georgia
(250), Minnesota (309), and Texas (677). There were only seven methamphetamine
lab incidents reported in Hawaii in 2004, though nearly 59 percent of substance
abuse treatment admissions (excluding alcohol) were for primary methamphetamine
abuse during the first six months of 2004. As of 2007, Missouri leads the
United States in clandestine lab seizures, with 1,268 incidents reported. Often
canine units are used for detecting rolling meth labs which can be concealed on
large vehicles, or transported on something as small as a motorcycle. These
labs are more difficult to detect than stationary ones, and can often be
obscured with the legal cargo on big trucks. Methamphetamine is sometimes used
in an injectable form, placing users and their partners at risk for
transmission of HIV and hepatitis C. "Meth" can also be inhaled, most commonly
vaporized on aluminum foil, or through a test tube or light bulb fashioned into
a pipe. This method is reported to give "an unnatural high" and a "brief
intense rush". In South Africa methamphetamine is called "tik" or "tik-tik".
Children as young as eight are abusing the substance, smoking it in crude glass
vials made from light bulbs. Since methamphetamine is easy to produce, the
substance is manufactured locally in staggering quantities. The government of
North Korea currently operates methamphetamine production facilities. There,
the drug is used as medicine since no others are available; it also is smuggled
across its border with China. Temazepam. Temazepam, a strong hypnotic
benzodiazepine, is illicitly manufactured in clandestine laboratories (called
"jellie labs") to supply the increasingly high demand for the hypnotic drug
internationally. Many clandestine temazepam labs are in Eastern Europe. The way
in which they manufacture the temazepam is through chemical alteration of
diazepam, oxazepam or lorazepam. Clandestine "jellie labs" have been identified
and shutdown in Russia, Ukraine, Czech Republic, Latvia and Belarus. In the
United Kingdom, temazepam is the most widely-abused legal, prescription drug.
It's also the most commonly abused benzodiazepine in Finland, Ireland, the
Netherlands, Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, India, Russia, People's Republic
of China, New Zealand, Australia and some parts of Southeast Asia. In Sweden it
has been banned due to a problem with drug abuse issues and a high rate of
death caused by temazepam alone relative to other drugs of its group. Surveys
in many countries show that temazepam, heroin, cocaine, MDMA, cannabis,
nimetazepam, and amphetamines rank among the top illegal drugs most frequently
abused.
