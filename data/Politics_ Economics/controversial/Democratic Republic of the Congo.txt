Democratic Republic of the Congo The Democratic Republic of the Congo (),
commonly referred to as DR Congo, Congo-Kinshasa or the DRC, is a country
located in central Africa. It is the second largest country in Africa by area
and the eleventh largest in the world. With a population of over 71 million,
the Democratic Republic of the Congo is the nineteenth most populous nation in
the world, the fourth most populous nation in Africa, as well as the most
populous officially Francophone country. It borders the Central African
Republic and South Sudan to the north; Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi in the east;
Zambia and Angola to the south; the Republic of the Congo, the Angolan exclave
of Cabinda, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west; and is separated from Tanzania
by Lake Tanganyika in the east. The country has access to the ocean through a
stretch of Atlantic coastline at Muanda and the roughly 9Â km wide mouth of the
Congo River which opens into the Gulf of Guinea. The Second Congo War,
beginning in 1998, devastated the country and is sometimes referred to as the
"African world war" because it involved nine African nations and some twenty
armed groups. Despite the signing of peace accords in 2003, fighting continues
in the east of the country. In eastern Congo, the prevalence of rape and other
sexual violence is described as the worst in the world. The war is the world's
deadliest conflict since World War II, killing 5.4 million people since 1998.
The vast majority died from conditions of malaria, diarrhea, pneumonia and
malnutrition. The Democratic Republic of the Congo was formerly, in
chronological order, the Congo Free State, Belgian Congo, Congo-LÃ©opoldville,
Congo-Kinshasa, and Zaire ("ZaÃ¯re" in French). These former names are
sometimes referred to as unofficial names, with the exception of Mobutu's
discredited Zaire, along with various abbreviations such as "DR Congo" and
"DRC". Though it is located in the Central African UN subregion, the nation is
also economically and regionally affiliated with Southern Africa as a member of
the Southern African Development Community (SADC). History. Early history. A
wave of early people was identified in the northern and north-western parts of
central Africa during the second millennium BC. They produced food (pearl
millet), maintained domestic livestock and developed a kind of arboriculture
mainly based on the oil palm. From BC to BC, starting from a nucleus area in
south Cameroon on both banks of the Sanaga River, the first Neolithic peopling
of northern and western central Africa can be followed south-eastwards and
southwards. In D.R. Congo, the first villages in the vicinity of Mbandaka and
the Lake Tumba are known as the Imbonga Traditions, from around BC. In Lower
Congo, north of the Angolan border, it is the 'Ngovo Tradition' around BC that
shows the arrival of the Neolithic wave of advance. In Kivu, across the country
to the east, the Urewe Tradition villages first appeared about BC. The few
archaeological sites known in Congo are a western extension of the Urewe
culture which has been found chiefly in Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and western
Kenya and Tanzania. From the start of this tradition, the people knew iron
smelting, as is evidenced by several iron-smelting furnaces excavated in Rwanda
and Burundi. The earliest evidence further to the west is known in Cameroon and
near to the small town of Bouar in Central Africa. Though further studies are
needed to establish a better chronology for the start of iron production in
Central Africa, the Cameroonian data places iron smelting north of the Atlantic
Equatorial coastal forests around BC to BC. This technology developed
independently from the previous Neolithic expansion, some 900 years later. As
fieldwork done by a German team shows, the Congo River network was slowly
settled by food-producing villagers going upstream in the forest. Work from a
Spanish project in the Ituri area further east suggests villages reached there
only around BC. The Bantu-speaking Neolithic and then iron-producing villagers
added to and displaced the indigenous Pygmy populations (also known in the
region as the "Batwa" or "Twa") into secondary parts of the country. Subsequent
migrations from the Darfur and Kordofan regions of Sudan into the north-east,
as well as East Africans migrating into the eastern Congo, added to the mix of
ethnic groups. The Bantu-speakers imported a mixed economy made up of
agriculture, small-stock raising, fishing, fruit collecting, hunting and
arboriculture before BC; iron-working techniques, possibly from West Africa, a
much later addition. The villagers established the Bantu language family as the
primary set of tongues for the Congolese. The process in which the original
Upemba society transitioned into the Kingdom of Luba was gradual and complex.
This transition ran without interruption, with several distinct societies
developing out of the Upemba culture prior to the genesis of the Luba. Each of
these kingdoms became very wealthy due mainly to the region's mineral wealth,
especially in ores. The civilization began to develop and implement iron and
copper technology, in addition to trading in ivory and other goods. The Luba
established a strong commercial demand for their metal technologies and were
able to institute a long-range commercial net (the business connections
extended over , all the way to the Indian Ocean). By the 16th century, the
kingdom had an established strong central government based on chieftainship.
The Eastern regions of the precolonial Congo were heavily disrupted by constant
slave raiding, mainly from Arab/Zanzibari slave traders such as the infamous
Tippu Tip. The African Congo Free State (1877â€“1908). European exploration,
exploitation, and administration took place from the 1870s until the 1920s. It
was first led by Sir Henry Morton Stanley, who undertook his explorations under
the sponsorship of King Leopold II of Belgium. Leopold had designs on what was
to become the Congo as a colony. In a succession of negotiations, Leopold â€“
professing humanitarian objectives in his capacity as chairman of the front
organization "Association Internationale Africaine" â€“ played one European
rival against another. Leopold formally acquired rights to the Congo territory
at the Conference of Berlin in 1885 and made the land his private property and
named it the Congo Free State. Leopold's regime began various infrastructure
projects, such as construction of the railway that ran from the coast to the
capital of Leopoldville (now Kinshasa). It took years to complete. Nearly all
such projects were aimed at increasing the capital which Leopold and his
associates could extract from the colony, leading to exploitation of Africans.
In the Free State, colonists brutalized the local population to produce rubber,
for which the spread of automobiles and development of rubber tires created a
growing international market. The sale of rubber made a fortune for Leopold,
who built several buildings in Brussels and Ostend to honor himself and his
country. To enforce the rubber quotas, the army, the "Force Publique" (FP), was
called in. The Force Publique made the practice of cutting off the limbs of the
natives as a means of enforcing rubber quotas a matter of policy; this practice
was widespread. During the period of 1885â€“1908, millions of Congolese died as
a consequence of exploitation and disease. In some areas the population
declined dramatically; it has been estimated that sleeping sickness and
smallpox killed nearly half the population in the areas surrounding the lower
Congo River. A government commission later concluded that the population of the
Congo had been "reduced by half" during this period, but determining precisely
how many people died is impossible, as no accurate records exist. The actions
of the Free State's administration sparked international protests led by
British reporter Edmund Dene Morel and British diplomat/Irish rebel Roger
Casement, whose 1904 report on the Congo condemned the practice. Famous writers
such as Mark Twain and Arthur Conan Doyle also protested, and Joseph Conrad's
novella "Heart of Darkness" was set in Congo Free State. Belgian Congo
(1908â€“1960). In 1908, the Belgian parliament, despite initial reluctance,
bowed to international pressure (especially that from Great Britain) and took
over the Free State from the king. From then on, as a Belgian colony, it was
called the Belgian Congo and was under the rule of the elected Belgian
government. The governing of the Congo improved significantly and considerable
economic and social progress was achieved. The white colonial rulers had,
however, generally a condescending, patronizing attitude toward the indigenous
peoples, which led to bitter resentment from both sides. During World War II,
the Congolese army achieved several victories against the Italians in North
Africa. Independence and Political crisis (1960â€“1965). In May 1960, a growing
nationalist movement, the Mouvement National Congolais or MNC Party, led by
Patrice Lumumba, won the parliamentary elections. The party appointed Lumumba
as Prime Minister. The parliament elected as President Joseph Kasavubu, of the
Alliance des Bakongo (ABAKO) party. Other parties that emerged included the
Parti Solidaire Africain (or PSA) led by Antoine Gizenga, and the Parti
National du Peuple (or PNP) led by Albert Delvaux and Laurent Mbariko. (Congo
1960, dossiers du CRISP, Belgium) The Belgian Congo achieved independence on 30
June 1960 under the name "RÃ©publique du Congo" ("Republic of Congo" or
"Republic of the Congo" in English). Shortly after independence, the provinces
of Katanga (led by Moise Tshombe) and South Kasai engaged in secessionist
struggles against the new leadership. Most of the 100,000 Europeans who had
remained behind after independence fled the country, opening the way for
Congolese to replace the European military and administrative elite. As the
French colony of Middle Congo (Moyen Congo) also chose the name "Republic of
Congo" upon achieving its independence, the two countries were more commonly
known as "Congo-LÃ©opoldville" and "Congo-Brazzaville", after their capital
cities. Another way they were often distinguished during the 1960s, such as in
newspaper articles, was that "Congo-LÃ©opoldville" was called "The Congo" and
"Congo-Brazzaville" was called simply "Congo". On 5 September 1960, Kasavubu
dismissed Lumumba from office. Lumumba declared Kasavubu's action
unconstitutional and a crisis between the two leaders developed. (cf.
"SÃ©cession au Katanga" â€“ J.Gerald-Libois -Brussels- CRISP) Lumumba had
previously appointed Joseph Mobutu chief of staff of the new Congo army, ArmÃ©e
Nationale Congolaise (ANC). Taking advantage of the leadership crisis between
Kasavubu and Lumumba, Mobutu garnered enough support within the army to create
mutiny. With financial support from the United States and Belgium, Mobutu paid
his soldiers privately. The aversion of Western powers to communism and leftist
ideology influenced their decision to finance Mobutu's quest to maintain
"order" in the new state by neutralizing Kasavubu and Lumumba in a coup by
proxy. A constitutional referendum after Mobutu's coup of 1965 resulted in the
country's official name being changed to the "Democratic Republic of the
Congo." In 1971 it was changed again to "Republic of ZaÃ¯re." On 17 January
1961, Katangan forces and Belgian paratroops â€“ supported by the United States
and Belgium â€“ kidnapped and executed Patrice Lumumba. Amidst widespread
confusion and chaos, a temporary government was led by technicians (CollÃ¨ge
des Commissaires) with Evariste Kimba. The Katanga secession was ended in
January 1963 with the assistance of UN forces. Several short-lived governments,
of Joseph Ileo, Cyrille Adoula, and Moise Tshombe, took over in quick
succession. Zaire (1971â€“1997). The new president Mobutu Sese Seko had the
support of the United States because of his staunch opposition to Communism.
Western powers appeared to believe this would make him a roadblock to Communist
schemes in Africa. A one-party system was established, and Mobutu declared
himself head of state. He periodically held elections in which he was the only
candidate. Although relative peace and stability were achieved, Mobutu's
government was guilty of severe human rights violations, political repression,
a cult of personality and corruption. (Mobutu demanded every Congolese banknote
be printed with his image, hanging of his portrait in all public buildings,
most businesses, and on billboards. It was common for ordinary people to wear
his likeness on their clothing.) Corruption became so prevalent the term "le
mal Zairois" or "Zairean Sickness",meaning gross corruption, theft and
mismanagement, was coined, reportedly by Mobutu himself. By 1984, Mobutu was
said to have $4 billion (USD), an amount close to the country's national debt,
deposited in a personal Swiss bank account. International aid, most often in
the form of loans, enriched Mobutu while he allowed national infrastructure
such as roads to deteriorate to as little as one-quarter of what had existed in
1960. Zaire became a "kleptocracy" as Mobutu and his associates embezzled
government funds. In a campaign to identify himself with African nationalism,
starting on 1 June 1966, Mobutu renamed the nation's cities: LÃ©opoldville
became Kinshasa country was now Democratic Republic of The
CongoÂ â€“Â Kinshasa, Stanleyville became Kisangani, Elisabethville became
Lubumbashi, and Coquihatville became Mbandaka. This renaming campaign was
completed in the 1970s. In 1971, Mobutu renamed the country the "Republic of
Zaire", its fourth name change in 11 years and its sixth overall. The Congo
River was renamed the Zaire River. In 1972, Mobutu renamed himself Mobutu Sese
Seko Kuku Ngbendu Wa Za Banga (translated as "the all powerful warrior who,
because of his endurance and inflexible will to win, shall go from conquest to
conquest, leaving fire in his wake"). During the 1970s and 1980s, Mobutu was
invited to visit the United States on several occasions, meeting with U.S.
Presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush. In June 1989,
Mobutu was the first African head of state invited for a state visit with newly
elected President Bush. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, however,
U.S. relations with Mobutu cooled, as he was no longer deemed necessary as a
Cold War ally. Opponents within Zaire stepped up demands for reform. This
atmosphere contributed to Mobutu's declaring the Third Republic in 1990, whose
constitution was supposed to pave the way for democratic reform. The reforms
turned out to be largely cosmetic. Mobutu continued in power until the conflict
forced him to flee Zaire in 1997. Thereafter, the nation chose to reclaim its
name of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, since the name "Zaire" carried
such strong connections to the rule of Mobutu. Rwandan/Ugandan invasions and
civil wars. By 1996, tensions from the neighbouring Rwandan Civil War and
Rwandan Genocide had spilled over to Zaire. Rwandan Hutu militia forces
(Interahamwe), who had fled Rwanda following the ascension of a Tutsi-led
government, had been using Hutu refugees camps in eastern Zaire as a basis for
incursion against Rwanda. These Hutu militia forces soon allied with the
Zairian armed forces (FAZ) to launch a campaign against Congolese ethnic Tutsis
in eastern Zaire. In turn, a coalition of Rwandan and Ugandan armies invaded
Zaire under the cover of a small group of Tutsi militia to fight the Hutu
militia, overthrow the government of Mobutu, and ultimately control the mineral
resources of Zaire. They were soon joined by various Zairean politicians, who
had been unsuccessfully opposing the dictatorship of Mobutu for many years, and
now saw an opportunity for them in the invasion of Zaire by two of the region's
strongest military forces. This new expanded coalition of two foreign armies
and some longtime opposition figures, led by Laurent-DÃ©sirÃ© Kabila, became
known as the Alliance des Forces DÃ©mocratiques pour la LibÃ©ration du Congo-
ZaÃ¯re (AFDL). They were seeking the broader goal of ousting Mobutu and
controlling his country's wealth. In May 1997, Mobutu fled the country and
Kabila marched into Kinshasa, naming himself president and reverting the name
of the country to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. [[File:DRC Rwanda

(2001). By 2008 the Second Congo War and its aftermath had killed 5.4Â million
people.]] A few months later, President Laurent-DÃ©sirÃ© Kabila thanked all the
foreign military forces that helped him to overthrow Mobutu, and asked them to
return back to their countries because he was concerned that the Rwandan
military officers who were running his army were plotting a coup d'Ã©tat
against him in order to give the presidency to a Tutsi who would report
directly to the President of Rwanda, Paul Kagame. This move was not well
received by the Rwandan and Ugandan governments, who wanted to control their
big neighbour. Consequently, Rwandan troops in DRC retreated to Goma and
launched a new militia group or rebel movement called the Rassemblement
Congolais pour la Democratie (RCD), led by Tutsis, to fight against their
former ally, President Kabila. To counterbalance the power and influence of
Rwanda in DRC, the Ugandan troops instigated the creation of another rebel
movement called the Movement for the Liberation of Congo (MLC), led by the
Congolese warlord Jean-Pierre Bemba, son of Congolese billionaire Bemba
Saolona. The two rebel movements started the second war by attacking the DRC's
still fragile army in 1998, backed by Rwandan and Ugandan troops. Angola,
Zimbabwe and Namibia became involved militarily on the side of the government
to defend a fellow SADC member. Kabila was assassinated in 2001 and was
succeeded by his son Joseph Kabila, who upon taking office called for
multilateral peace talks to end the war. In February 2001 a peace deal was
brokered between Kabila, Rwanda and Uganda, leading to the apparent withdrawal
of foreign troops. UN peacekeepers, MONUC, arrived in April 2001. The conflict
was reignited in January 2002 by ethnic clashes in the northeast, and both
Uganda and Rwanda then halted their withdrawal and sent in more troops. Talks
between Kabila and the rebel leaders led to the signing of a peace accord in
which Kabila would share power with former rebels. By June 2003 all foreign
armies except those of Rwanda had pulled out of Congo. Much of the conflict was
focused on gaining control of substantial natural resources in the country,
including diamonds, copper, zinc, and coltan. DR Congo had a transitional
government until the election was over. A constitution was approved by voters,
and on 30 July 2006 the Congo held its first multi-party elections since
independence in 1960. After this Joseph Kabila took 45% of the votes and his
opponent, Jean-Pierre Bemba took 20%. The disputed results of this election
turned into an all-out battle between the supporters of the two parties in the
streets of the capital, Kinshasa, from 20â€“22 August 2006 . Sixteen people
died before police and the UN mission MONUC took control of the city. A new
election was held on 29 October 2006, which Kabila won with 70% of the vote.
Bemba made multiple public statements saying the election had "irregularities",
despite the fact that every neutral observer praised the elections. On 6
December 2006 the Transitional Government came to an end as Joseph Kabila was
sworn in as President. The fragility of the state government has allowed
continued conflict and human rights abuses. In the ongoing Kivu conflict, the
Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) continues to threaten the
Rwandan border and the Banyarwanda; Rwanda supports RCD-Goma rebels against
Kinshasa; a rebel offensive at the end of October 2008 caused a refugee crisis
in Ituri, where MONUC has proved unable to contain the numerous militia and
groups driving the Ituri conflict. In the northeast, Joseph Kony's LRA moved
from their original bases in Uganda (where they have fought a 20-year
rebellion) and South Sudan to DR Congo in 2005 and set up camps in the Garamba
National Park. In northern Katanga, the Mai-Mai created by Laurent Kabila
slipped out of the control of Kinshasa. The war is the world's deadliest
conflict since World War II, killing 5.4 million people. Impact of armed
conflict on civilians. In 2009, people in the Congo may still be dying at a
rate of an estimated 45,000 per month, and estimates of the number who have
died from the long conflict range from 900,000 to 5,400,000. The death toll is
due to widespread disease and famine; reports indicate that almost half of the
individuals who have died are children under the age of 5. This death rate has
prevailed since efforts at rebuilding the nation began in 2004. The long and
brutal conflict in the DRC has caused massive suffering for civilians, with
estimates of millions dead either directly or indirectly as a result of the
fighting. There have been frequent reports of weapon bearers killing civilians,
destroying property, widespread sexual violence, causing hundreds of thousands
of people to flee their homes or otherwise breaching humanitarian and human
rights law. An estimated 200,000 women have been raped. Few people in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) have been unaffected by the armed
conflict. A survey conducted in 2009 by the ICRC and Ipsos shows that three
quarters (76%) of the people interviewed have been affected in some
wayâ€“either personally or due to the wider consequences of armed conflict. In
2003, Sinafasi Makelo, a representative of Mbuti pygmies, told the UN's
Indigenous People's Forum that during the war, his people were hunted down and
eaten as though they were game animals. In neighbouring North Kivu province
there has been cannibalism by a group known as "Les Effaceurs" ("the erasers")
who wanted to clear the land of people to open it up for mineral exploitation.
Both sides of the war regarded them as "subhuman" and some say their flesh can
confer magical powers. International Community Response. The response of the
international community has been incommensurate with the scale of the disaster
resulting from the war in the Congo. Its support for political and diplomatic
efforts to end the war has been relatively consistent, but it has taken no
effective steps to abide by repeated pledges to demand accountability for the
war crimes and crimes against humanity that were routinely committed in Congo.
United Nations Security Council and the U.N. Secretary-General have frequently
denounced human rights abuses and the humanitarian disaster that the war
unleashed on the local population. But they had shown little will to tackle the
responsibility of occupying powers for the atrocities taking place in areas
under their control, areas where the worst violence in the country took place.
Hence Rwanda, like Uganda, has escaped any significant sanction for its role.
Geography. The Congo is situated at the heart of sub-Saharan Africa and is
bounded by (clockwise from the southwest) Angola, the South Atlantic Ocean, the
Republic of Congo, the Central African Republic, South Sudan, Uganda, Rwanda,
Burundi, Tanzania across Lake Tanganyika, and Zambia. The country lies between
latitudes 6Â°N and 14Â°S, and longitudes 12Â° and 32Â°E. It straddles the
Equator, with one-third to the North and two-thirds to the South. The size of
Congo, , is slightly greater than the combined areas of Spain, France, Germany,
Sweden, and Norway. As a result of its equatorial location, the Congo
experiences high precipitation and has the highest frequency of thunderstorms
in the world. The annual rainfall can total upwards of in some places, and the
area sustains the Congo Rainforest, the second largest rain forest in the world
(after that of the Amazon). This massive expanse of lush jungle covers most of
the vast, low-lying central basin of the river, which slopes toward the
Atlantic Ocean in the west. This area is surrounded by plateaus merging into
savannas in the south and southwest, by mountainous terraces in the west, and
dense grasslands extending beyond the Congo River in the north. High, glaciated
mountains are found in the extreme eastern region (Rwenzori Mountains). The
tropical climate has also produced the Congo River system which dominates the
region topographically along with the rainforest it flows through, though they
are not mutually exclusive. The name for the Congo state is derived in part
from the river. The river basin (meaning the Congo River and all of its myriad
tributaries) occupies nearly the entire country and an area of nearly . The
river and its tributaries (major offshoots include the Kasai, Sangha, Ubangi,
Aruwimi, and Lulonga) form the backbone of Congolese economics and
transportation. They have a dramatic impact on the daily lives of the people.
The sources of the Congo are in the Albertine Rift Mountains that flank the
western branch of the East African Rift, as well as Lake Tanganyika and Lake
Mweru. The river flows generally west from Kisangani just below Boyoma Falls,
then gradually bends southwest, passing by Mbandaka, joining with the Ubangi
River, and running into the Pool Malebo (Stanley Pool). Kinshasa and
Brazzaville are on opposite sides of the river at the Pool (see NASA image).
Then the river narrows and falls through a number of cataracts in deep canyons
(collectively known as the Livingstone Falls), and then running past Boma into
the Atlantic Ocean. The river also has the second-largest flow and the second-
largest watershed of any river in the world (trailing the Amazon in both
respects). The river and a 45Â km wide strip of land on its north bank provide
the country's only outlet to the Atlantic. The previously mentioned Albertine
Rift plays a key role in shaping the Congo's geography. Not only is the
northeastern section of the country much more mountainous, but due to the
rift's tectonic activities, this area also experiences volcanic activity,
occasionally with loss of life. The geologic activity in this area also created
the famous African Great Lakes, three of which lie on the Congo's eastern
frontier: Lake Albert (known previously as Lake Mobutu), Lake Edward, and Lake
Tanganyika. The Rift Valley has exposed an enormous amount of mineral wealth
throughout the south and east of the Congo, making it accessible to mining.
Cobalt, copper, cadmium, industrial and gem-quality diamonds, gold, silver,
zinc, manganese, tin, germanium, uranium, radium, bauxite, iron ore, and coal
are all found in plentiful supply, especially in the Congo's southeastern
Katanga region. On 17 January 2002 Mount Nyiragongo erupted in Congo, with the
lava running out at and wide. One of the three streams of extremely fluid lava
flowed through the nearby city of Goma, killing 45 and leaving 120,000
homeless. Four hundred thousand people were evacuated from the city during the
eruption. The lava poisoned the water of Lake Kivu, killing fish. Only two
planes left the local airport because of the possibility of the explosion of
stored petrol. The lava passed the airport but ruined the runway, entrapping
several airplanes. Six months after the 2002 eruption, nearby Mount Nyamulagira
also erupted. Mount Nyamulagira also erupted in 2006 and again in January 2010.
Virunga National Park (1979), Garamba National Park (1980), Kahuzi-Biega
National Park (1980), Salonga National Park (1984) and Okapi Wildlife Reserve
(1996). Provinces. The country is divided into ten provinces and one city-
province. The provinces are subdivided into districts which are divided into
territories. Government. After a four-year interim between two constitutions
that established new political institutions at the various levels of all
branches of government, as well as new administrative divisions for the
provinces throughout the country, politics in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo have finally settled into a stable presidential democratic republic. The
2003 transitional constitution established a system composed of a bicameral
legislature with a Senate and a National Assembly. The Senate had, among other
things, the charge of drafting the new constitution of the country. The
executive branch was vested in a 60-member cabinet, headed by a President and
four vice presidents. The President was also the Commander-in Chief of the
armed forces. The transition constitution also established a relatively
independent judiciary, headed by a Supreme Court with constitutional
interpretation powers. The 2006 constitution, also known as the Constitution of
the Third Republic, came into effect in February 2006. It had concurrent
authority, however, with the transitional constitution until the inauguration
of the elected officials who emerged from the July 2006 elections. Under the
new constitution, the legislature remained bicameral; the executive was
concomitantly undertaken by a President and the government, led by a Prime
Minister, appointed from the party with the majority at the National Assembly.
The governmentÂ  â€“ not the PresidentÂ  â€“ is responsible to the Parliament.
The new constitution also granted new powers to the provincial governments with
the creation of provincial parliaments, which have oversight over the Governor,
head of the provincial government, whom they elect. The new constitution also
saw the disappearance of the Supreme Court, which was divided into three new
institutions. The constitutional interpretation prerogative of the Supreme
Court is now held by the Constitutional Court. Corruption. Mobutu Sese Seko
ruled Zaire from 1965 to 1997. A relative explained how the government
illicitly collected revenue: "Mobutu would ask one of us to go to the bank and
take out a million. We'd go to an intermediary and tell him to get five
million. He would go to the bank with Mobutu's authority, and take out ten.
Mobutu got one, and we took the other nine." Mobutu institutionalized
corruption to prevent political rivals from challenging his control, leading to
an economic collapse in 1996. Mobutu allegedly stole up to US$4 to US$5 billion
while in office; in July 2009, a Swiss court determined that the statute of
limitations had run out on an international asset recovery case of about $6.7
million of deposits of Mobutu's in a Swiss bank, and therefore the assets
should be returned to Mobutu's family. President Joseph Kabila established the
Commission of Repression of Economic Crimes upon his ascension to power in
2001. Foreign relations and military. The global growth in demand for scarce
raw materials and the industrial surges in China, India, Russia, Brazil and
other developing countries require that developed countries employ new,
integrated and responsive strategies for identifying and ensuring, on a
continual basis, an adequate supply of strategic and critical materials
required for their security needs. Highlighting the DR Congo's importance to
United States national security, the effort to establish an elite Congolese
unit is the latest push by the U.S. to professionalize armed forces in this
strategically important region. There are economic and strategic incentives to
bringing more security to the Congo, which is rich in natural resources such as
cobalt. Cobalt is a strategic and critical metal used in many diverse
industrial and military applications. The largest use of cobalt is in
superalloys, which are used to make jet engine parts. Cobalt is also used in
magnetic alloys and in cutting and wear-resistant materials such as cemented
carbides. The chemical industry consumes significant quantities of cobalt in a
variety of applications including catalysts for petroleum and chemical
processing; drying agents for paints and inks; ground coats for porcelain
enamels; decolourisers for ceramics and glass; and pigments for ceramics,
paints, and plastics. The country contains 80 percent of the world's cobalt
reserves. Economy. Although citizens of the DRC are among the poorest in the
world, having the second lowest nominal GDP per capita, the Democratic Republic
of Congo is widely considered to be the richest country in the world regarding
natural resources; its untapped deposits of raw minerals are estimated to be
worth in excess of US$ 24 trillion. The economy of the Democratic Republic of
the Congo, a nation endowed with resources of vast potential wealth, has
declined drastically since the mid-1980s. At the time of its independence in
1960, DRC was the second most industrialized country in Africa after South
Africa, it boasted a thriving mining sector and its agriculture sector was
relatively productive. The two recent conflicts (the First and Second Congo
Wars), which began in 1996, have dramatically reduced national output and
government revenue, have increased external debt, and have resulted in deaths
of more than five million people from war, and associated famine and disease.
Malnutrition affects approximately two thirds of the country's population.
Foreign businesses have curtailed operations due to uncertainty about the
outcome of the conflict, lack of infrastructure, and the difficult operating
environment. The war has intensified the impact of such basic problems as an
uncertain legal framework, corruption, inflation, and lack of openness in
government economic policy and financial operations. Conditions improved in
late 2002 with the withdrawal of a large portion of the invading foreign
troops. A number of International Monetary Fund and World Bank missions have
met with the government to help it develop a coherent economic plan, and
President Joseph Kabila has begun implementing reforms. Much economic activity
lies outside the GDP data. A United Nations Human Development Index report
shows human development to be one of the worst in decades. Through 2011 the
Democratic Republic of the Congo had the lowest Human Development Index of the
187 ranked countries, classified lower than Niger despite a higher margin of
improvement than the latter country from 2010's numbers. The economy of the
second largest country in Africa relies heavily on mining. However, the
smaller-scale economic activity occurs in the informal sector and is not
reflected in GDP data. The largest mines in the Congo are located in the Shaba
province, in the South. The Congo is the world's largest producer of cobalt
ore, and a major producer of copper and industrial diamonds, the latter coming
from the Kasai province in the West. The Congo has 70% of the world's coltan,
and more than 30% of the world's diamond reserves. mostly in the form of small,
industrial diamonds. The coltan is a major source of tantalum, which is used in
the fabrication of electronic components in computers and mobile phones. In
2002, tin was discovered in the east of the country, but, to date, mining has
been on a small scale. Smuggling of the conflict minerals, coltan and
cassiterite (ores of tantalum and tin, respectively), has helped fuel the war
in the Eastern Congo. Katanga Mining Limited, a Swiss-owned company, owns the
Luilu Metallurgical Plant, which has a capacity of 175,000 tonnes of copper and
8,000 tonnes of cobalt per year, making it the largest cobalt refinery in the
world. After a major rehabilitation program, the company restarted copper
production in December 2007 and cobalt production in May 2008. The Democratic
Republic of Congo also possesses 50 percent of Africa's forests and a river
system that could provide hydro-electric power to the entire continent,
according to a U.N. report on the country's strategic significance and its
potential role as an economic power in central Africa. It is one of the twenty
lowest ranked countries on the Corruption Perception Index. In 2007, The World
Bank decided to grant the Democratic Republic of Congo up to $1.3 billion in
assistance funds over the next three years. The Democratic Republic of Congo is
in the process of becoming a member of the Organization for the Harmonization
of Business Law in Africa (OHADA). Demographics. Ethnic groups. The United
Nations 2009 estimated the population at 66 million people, having increased
rapidly despite the war from 39.1 million in 1992. As many as 250 ethnic groups
have been identified and named. The most numerous people are the Kongo, Luba,
and Mongo. About 600,000 Pygmies are the aboriginal people of the DR Congo.
Although several hundred local languages and dialects are spoken, the
linguistic variety is bridged both by widespread use of French and intermediary
languages such as Kongo, Tshiluba, Swahili, and Lingala. Migration. Given the
situation in the country and the condition of state structures, it is extremely
difficult to obtain reliable data. However, evidence suggests that DRC
continues to be a destination country for immigrants in spite of recent
declines. Immigration is seen to be very diverse in nature, with refugees and
asylum-seekers â€“ products of the numerous and violent conflicts in the Great
Lakes Region â€“ constituting an important subset of the population in the
country. Additionally, the country's large mine operations attract migrant
workers from Africa and beyond and there is considerable migration for
commercial activities from other African countries and the rest of the world,
but these movements are not well studied. Transit migration towards South
Africa and Europe also plays a role. Immigration in the DRC has decreased
steadily over the past two decades, most likely as a result of the armed
violence that the country has experienced. According to the International
Organization for Migration, the number of immigrants in the DRC has declined
from just over 1 million in 1960, to 754,000 in 1990, to 480,000 in 2005, to an
estimated 445,000 in 2010. Valid figures are not available on migrant workers
in particular, partly due to the predominance of the informal economy in the
DRC. Data are also lacking on irregular immigrants, however given neighbouring
country ethnic links to nationals of the DRC, irregular migration is assumed to
be a significant phenomenon in the country. Figures on the number of Congolese
nationals abroad vary greatly depending on the source, from 3 to 6 million.
This discrepancy is due to a lack of official, reliable data. Emigrants from
the DRC are above all long-term emigrants, the majority of which live within
Africa and to a lesser extent in Europe; 79.7% and 15.3% respectively,
according to estimates on 2000 data. New destination countries include South
Africa and various points en route to Europe. In addition to being a host
country, the DRC has also produced a considerable number of refugees and
asylum-seekers located in the region and beyond. These numbers peaked in 2004
when, according to UNHCR, there were more than 460,000 refugees from the DRC;
in 2008, Congolese refugees numbered 367,995 in total, 68% of which were living
in other African countries. Status of women. The United Nations Committee on
the Elimination of Discrimination against Women in 2006 expressed concern that
in the post-war transition period, the promotion of women's human rights and
gender equality is not seen as a priority. In eastern Congo, the prevalence and
intensity of rape and other sexual violence is described as the worst in the
world. A 2006 report by the African Association for the Defence of Human Rights
prepared for that committee provides a broad overview of issues confronting
women in the DRC in law and in daily life. The war has made the life of women
more precarious. Violence against women seems to be perceived by large sectors
of society to be normal. In July 2007, the International Committee of the Red
Cross expressed concern about the situation in eastern DRC. A phenomenon of
'pendulum displacement' has developed, where people hasten at night to safety.
According to Yakin ErtÃ¼rk, the UN Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women
who toured eastern Congo in July 2007, violence against women in North and
South Kivu included 'unimaginable brutality'. 'Armed groups attack local
communities, loot, rape, kidnap women and children, and make them work as
sexual slaves,' ErtÃ¼rk said. In December 2008 GuardianFilms of "The Guardian"
released a film documenting the testimony of over 400 women and girls who had
been abused by marauding militia. In June 2010, UK aid group Oxfam reported a
dramatic increase in the number of rapes occurring in the Democratic Republic
of the Congo, while researchers from Harvard discovered that rapes committed by
civilians had increased seventeenfold. Religion. Christianity is the majority
religion in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, followed by about 95% of the
population. Animism accounts for about 1%. Of a population of 71 million, there
are about 35 million Catholics in the country, representing about half of the
total population There are six archdioceses and 41 dioceses. The impact of the
Roman Catholic Church in the Democratic Republic of Congo is difficult to
overestimate. Schatzberg has called it the country's "only truly national
institution apart from the state." Its schools have educated over 60 percent of
the nation's primary school students and more than 40 percent of its secondary
students. The church owns and manages an extensive network of hospitals,
schools, and clinics, as well as many diocesan economic enterprises, including
farms, ranches, stores, and artisans' shops. Kimbanguism was seen as a threat
to the colonial regime and was banned by the Belgians. Kimbanguism, officially
"the church of Christ on Earth by the prophet Simon Kimbangu", now has about
three million members, primarily among the Bakongo of Bas-Congo and Kinshasa.
Sixty-two of the Protestant denominations in the country are federated under
the umbrella of the Church of Christ in Congo or CCC (in French, "Ã‰glise du
Christ au Congo" or ECC). It is often simply referred to as 'The Protestant
Church', since it covers most of the 35% of the population who are Protestants.
Islam is the faith of 1.5% of the population. Islam was introduced and mainly
spread by Arab traders/merchants. The first members of the Baha'i Faith to live
in the country came from Uganda in 1953. Four years later the first local
administrative council was elected. In 1970 the National Spiritual Assembly
(national administrative council) was first elected. Though the religion was
banned in the 1970s and 80s, due to misrepresentations of foreign governments,
the ban was lifted by the end of the 1980s. In 2012 plans were announced to
build a national Baha'i House of Worship in the country. Traditional religions
embody such concepts as monotheism, animism, vitalism, spirit and ancestor
worship, witchcraft, and sorcery and vary widely among ethnic groups. The
syncretic sects often merge elements of Christianity with traditional beliefs
and rituals and are not recognized by mainstream churches as part of
Christianity. Under the weight of poverty, new and disturbing variants on
ancient beliefs have become widespread, lead by US inspired Pentecostal
churches which have been in the forefront of witchcraft accusations
particularly against children and the elderly. In these practices of children
being accused of witchcraft and sent away from homes and family often to live
on the street. The usual term for these children is "enfants sorciers" (child
witches) or "enfants dits sorciers" (children accused of witchcraft) and can
lead to physical violence against these children. Non-denominational church
organizations have been formed to capitalize on this belief by charging
exorbitant fees for exorcisms. Though recently outlawed, children have been
subjected to often-violent abuse at the hands of self-proclaimed prophets and
priests. Languages. French is the official language of the Democratic Republic
of the Congo. It is meant to be an ethnically neutral language, to ease
communication among the many different ethnic groups of the Congo. There are an
estimated total of 242 languages spoken in the country. Out of these, only four
have the status of national languages: Kikongo (Kituba), Lingala, Tshiluba and
Swahili. Although some people speak these regional, or trade languages, as
first languages, most of the population speak them as a second language after
their own tribal language. Primary education tends to be in the national Bantu
language of the region, and secondary education, and beyond, tends to be in
French. Lingala was made the official language of the colonial army, the "Force
Publique" under Belgian colonial rule. But since the recent rebellions, a good
part of the army in the East also uses Swahili where it is prevalent. When the
country was a Belgian colony, it had already instituted teaching and use of the
four national languages in primary schools, making it one of the few African
nations to have had literacy in local languages during the European colonial
period. During the colonial period both Dutch and French were the official
languages but French was by far the most important. About 24,320,000 people of
DRC speak French either as a first or second language. Health. Congo has the
world's second-highest rate of infant mortality (after Chad). In Eastern Congo
there are still unrest and fighting among tribal and also warlord armies to
control diamonds and other minerals. In April 2011, through aid from Global
Alliance for Vaccines, a new vaccine to prevent pneumococcal disease was
introduced around Kinshasa. Culture. The culture of the Democratic Republic of
the Congo reflects the diversity of its hundreds of ethnic groups and their
differing ways of life throughout the countryÂ  â€” from the mouth of the River
Congo on the coast, upriver through the rainforest and savanna in its centre,
to the more densely populated mountains in the far east. Since the late 19th
century, traditional ways of life have undergone changes brought about by
colonialism, the struggle for independence, the stagnation of the Mobutu era,
and most recently, the First and Second Congo Wars. Despite these pressures,
the customs and cultures of the Congo have retained much of their
individuality. The country's 60 million inhabitants are mainly rural. The 30
percent who live in urban areas have been the most open to Western influences.
Another notable feature in Congo culture is its sui generis music. The DROC has
blended its ethnic musical sources with Cuban rumba, and merengue to give birth
to soukous. Influential figures of soukous and its offshoots: N'dombolo and
Rumba rock, are Grand Kalle, Dr. Nico, Franco Luambo, Tabu Ley, Lutumba Simaro,
King Kester Emeneya, Tshala Muana Koffi Olomide, JB Mpiana, Werrason, Kanda
Bongo, Ray Lema, Mpongo Love, Abeti Masikini, Reddy Amisi, Pepe Kalle, Fally
Ipupa, Awilo Longomba, Gatho Buvens, Ferre Gola and Nyoka Longo. Other African
nations produce music genres that are derived from Congolese soukous. Some of
the African bands sing in Lingala, one of the main languages in the DRC. The
same Congolese soukous, under the guidance of "le sapeur", Papa Wemba, has set
the tone for a generation of young men always dressed up in expensive
designers' clothes', they became to be known as the 4th generation of the
congolese music and they mostly come from the former well known band Wenge
Musica. The Congo is also known for its art. Traditional art includes masks and
wooden statues. Notable contemporary artists and fashion designers are Odette
Maniema Krempin, Lema Kusa, Henri Kalama Akulez, Nshole, Mavinga, Claudy Khan
et ChÃ©ri Samba. Education. In 2001 the literacy rate was estimated to be 67.2%
(80.9% male and 54.1% female). The education system in the Democratic Republic
of the Congo is governed by three government ministries: the "MinistÃ¨re de
l'Enseignement Primaire, Secondaire et Professionnel (MEPSP"), the "MinistÃ¨re
de l'Enseignement SupÃ©rieur et Universitaire (MESU)" and the "MinistÃ¨re des
Affaires Sociales (MAS)". The educational system in the DRC is similar to that
of Belgium. In 2002, there were over 19,000 primary schools serving 160,000
students; and 8,000 secondary schools serving 110,000 students. Primary
education is free and compulsory (Article 43 of the 2005 Congolese
Constitution). Gross enrollment ratios are based on the number of students
formally registered in primary school and therefore do not necessarily reflect
actual school attendance. In 2000, 65 percent of children ages 10 to 14 years
were attending school. As a result of the 6-year civil war, over 5.2 million
children in the country receive no education. Transport. Ground transport in
the Democratic Republic of Congo has always been difficult. The terrain and
climate of the Congo Basin present serious barriers to road and rail
construction, and the distances are enormous across this vast country.
Furthermore, chronic economic mismanagement and internal conflict has led to
serious under-investment over many years. On the other hand, the Democratic
Republic of Congo has thousands of kilometres of navigable waterways, and
traditionally water transport has been the dominant means of moving around
approximately two-thirds of the country. All air carriers certified by the
Democratic Republic of the Congo have been banned from European Union airports
by the European Commission, because of inadequate safety standards. Flora and
fauna. The rainforests of the Democratic Republic of the Congo contain great
biodiversity, including many rare and endemic species, such as the common
chimpanzee and the bonobo (formerly known as the Pygmy Chimpanzee), the forest
elephant, mountain gorilla, okapi and white rhino. Five of the country's
national parks are listed as World Heritage Sites: the Garumba, Kahuzi-Biega,
Salonga and Virunga National Parks, and the Okapi Wildlife Reserve. The
Democratic Republic of the Congo is the most biodiverse African country. The
civil war and resultant poor economic conditions have endangered much of this
biodiversity. Many park wardens were either killed or could not afford to
continue their work. All five sites are listed by UNESCO as World Heritage In
Danger. The Democratic Republic of Congo is also home to some cryptids, such as
Mokele mbembe. Over the past century or so, the DRC has developed into the
center of what has been called the Central African "bushmeat" problem, which is
regarded by many as a major environmental as well as socio-economic crisis.
"Bushmeat" is another word for the meat of wild animals. It is typically
obtained through trapping, usually with wire snares, or otherwise with
shotguns, poisoned arrows or arms originally intended for use in the DRC's
numerous military conflicts. File:Bas-congo.JPG|Bas-Congo landscape File:Male

Elephant  The "bushmeat crisis" has emerged in the DRC mainly as a result of
the poor living conditions of the Congolese people and a lack of education
about the dangers of eating it. A rising population combined with deplorable
economic conditions has forced many Congolese to become dependent on bushmeat,
either as a means of acquiring income (hunting the meat and selling), or are
dependent on it for food. Unemployment and urbanization throughout Central
Africa have exacerbated the problem further by turning cities like the urban
sprawl of Kinshasa into the prime market for commercial bushmeat. This
combination has caused not only widespread endangerment of local fauna, but has
forced humans to trudge deeper into the wilderness in search of the desired
animal meat. This overhunting results in the deaths of more animals and makes
resources even more scarce for humans. The hunting has also been facilitated by
the extensive logging prevalent throughout the Congo's rainforests (from
corporate logging, in addition to farmers clearing out forest for agriculture),
which allows hunters much easier access to previously unreachable jungle
terrain, while simultaneously eroding away at the habitats of animals.
Deforestation is accelerating in Central Africa. A case that has particularly
alarmed conservationists is that of primates. The Congo is inhabited by three
distinct great ape speciesÂ  â€” the Common chimpanzee ("Pan troglodytes"), the
bonobo ("Pan paniscus") and the gorilla. It is the only country in the world in
which bonobos are found in the wild. The chimpanzee and bonobo are the closest
living evolutionary relatives to humans. Much concern has been raised about
Great ape extinction. Because of hunting and habitat destruction, the
chimpanzee and the gorilla, both of whose population once numbered in the
millions, have now dwindled down to only about 200,000 gorillas, 100,000
chimpanzees and possibly only about 10,000 bonobos. Gorillas, chimpanzees, and
bonobos are all classified as by the World Conservation Union, as well as the
okapi, which is also native to the area geography.
