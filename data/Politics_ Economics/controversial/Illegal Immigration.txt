Illegal immigration Illegal immigration is migration to a country/state in
violation of the immigration laws and sovereignty of that country/state.
Illegal immigration raises many political, economic and social issues and has
become a source of major controversy in developed countries and the more
successful developing countries. In 2010, the International Organization for
Migration (IOM) estimated that 25.5 to 32.1 million people (or 10%‚Äì15%) of
the world's total 214 million international migrants are unauthorized
immigrants, though the IOM notes that it is difficult to make accurate
estimates. Causes. Public policies. In the U.S., 11-20 million unauthorized
immigrants have very high chances of being deported and only a very small
fraction of employers that hire them are ever penalized. Many American
activists and illegal immigration reduction groups have argued that the under-
enforcement of U.S. immigration laws constitutes a crisis, and several states
including Arizona and Georgia among others have started enacting and enforcing
their own immigration laws. At times in the history of the United States, the
government has passed a type of amnesty for unauthorized immigrants, who
entered without inspection. The last amnesty was the extension of the Life Act,
section 245(i), which allowed unauthorized immigrants who entered without
inspection to apply if they had an immigrant visa immediately available and
paid a $1,000 penalty. In order to have a visa immediately available, they
needed to have an immediate family member petition for them. The extension
ended on April 30, 2001. http://www.uscis.gov/files/pressrelease/
Section245ProvisionLIFEAct_032301.pdf Children born in the United States
receive citizenship through birth. Currently, those children may petition for
their parents when they reach 21 years old. The United States is one of only
two high average income countries (the other country is Canada which offers it
in limited circumstances) that still gives birthright citizenship for children
born where both parents are unauthorized immigrants, tourists, visitors or
other types of temporary residents (diplomats excepted). Economics and labor
markets. Illegal immigration occurs principally from countries with lower
socio-economic circumstances to countries with higher socio-economic
circumstances, where illegal immigrants perceive greater economic opportunities
and quality of life. This has typically been viewed as driving people from
developing countries to developed countries, but as economic conditions improve
in a number of developing countries, illegal immigration to these more
successful developing countries has also increased significantly. When
potential unauthorized immigrants believe the probability and benefits of
successfully migrating to the destination country are greater than the costs,
illegal immigration is an attractive option. The benefits taken into account
include not only expected improvements in pay and living conditions, but also
expectations in relation to potential future immigration amnesty, where illegal
immigration is given a path to naturalization or citizenship, and also the
rights to citizenship of future children. The costs may include restrictions on
living as an illegal immigrant in the destination country, leaving family and
ways of life behind, and the probability of being detained and resulting
sanctions. Proposed economic models of illegal immigration include varying
considerations and degrees of complexity. Neoclassical model. The neoclassical
economic model looks only at the probability of success in immigrating and
finding employment, and the increase in real income an illegal immigrant can
expect. This explanation would account for the economies of the two states,
including how much of a "pull" the destination country has in terms of better-
paying jobs and improvements in quality of life. It also describes a "push"
that comes from negative conditions in the home country like lack of employment
or economic mobility. Neoclassical theory posits that factors such as
geographic proximity, border enforcement, probability and consequences of
arrest, ease of illegal employment, and chances of future legalization govern
the likelihood of "successful" illegal immigration. This model also assumes
that illegal workers tend to add to, and compete with, the receiving nation's
pool of unskilled laborers. Illegal workers in this model find employment by
accepting lower wages than native-born workers, sometimes below the minimum
wage and "off-the-books". Economist George Borjas supports aspects of this
model, calculating that real wages of US workers without a high school degree
declined by 9% from 1980‚Äì2000 due to competition from illegal immigrant
workers. Large-scale economic evidence supports neoclassical theory, as may be
seen in the long-term correlation of relative wages/unemployment and illegal
immigration from Mexico to the US. However, immigration scholars such as Gordon
Hanson and Douglas Massey have criticized the model for being oversimplified
and not accounting for contradictory evidence, such as low net illegal
immigration from Mexico to the US before the 1980s despite significant economic
disparity. Numerous refinements have been suggested to account for other
factors, as seen below. Trade liberalization. In recent years, developing
states have pursued the benefits of globalization by adopting measures to
liberalize trade. But rapid opening of domestic markets may lead to
displacement of large numbers of agricultural or unskilled workers, who are
more likely to seek employment and a higher quality of life by illegal
immigration. This is a frequently cited argument to explain how the North
American Free Trade Agreement may have impoverished Mexican farmers who were
unable to compete with the higher productivity of US subsidized agriculture,
especially for corn. NAFTA may have also unexpectedly raised educational
requirements for industrial jobs in Mexico, since the new "maquiladoras"
produced export products requiring skills and education that many unskilled
workers did not have. Structural demand in developed states. Douglas Massey
argues that a bifurcating labor market in developed nations creates a
structural demand for unskilled immigrant labor to fill undesirable jobs that
native-born citizens do not seek, "regardless of wages". He postulates that
postindustrial economies have a widening gap between well-paying, white-collar
jobs that require ever higher levels of education ("human capital"), for which
native-born citizens and legal immigrants can qualify, and bottom-tier jobs
that are stigmatized and require no education. These "underclass" jobs include
harvesting crops, unskilled labor in landscaping and construction, house-
cleaning, and maid and busboy work in hotels and restaurants, all of which have
a disproportionate number of illegal workers. Research indicates that the
advantage to firms from employing undocumented workers increases as more firms
in the industry do so, decreases with the skill level of the firm's workers,
increases with the breadth of a firm's market, and increases with the labor
intensity of the firm's production process. Since the decline of middle-class
blue-collar jobs in manufacturing and industry, younger native-born generations
have acquired higher education. The majority of new blue-collar jobs qualify as
Massey's "underclass" work, and suffer from unreliability, subservient roles,
and, critically, a lack of potential for advancement. Entry-level white-collar
and service jobs offer advancement opportunities for native-born and legal
immigrant workers. In a developed country like the US, only 12% of the labor
force has less than a high school education. Unauthorized immigrants have much
lower levels of education (about 70% of illegal workers in the US from Mexico
lack a high school degree). Even "underclass" jobs have much higher relative
wages than those in home countries. Since unauthorized immigrants often
anticipate working only temporarily in the destination country, the lack of
opportunity for advancement is less of a problem. Evidence for this can be seen
in a Pew Hispanic Center poll of over 3,000 unauthorized immigrants from Mexico
in the US, which found that 79% would voluntarily join a temporary worker
program that allowed them to work legally for several years but then required
them to leave. The structural demand theory posits that willingness to take
undesirable jobs is what gives unauthorized immigrants their employment.
Structural demand theory argues that cases like this show that there is no
direct competition between unskilled unauthorized immigrants and native-born
workers. This is the concept that unauthorized immigrants "take jobs that no
one else wants". Massey argues that this has certain implications for policy,
as it may refute claims that unauthorized immigrants are "lowering wages" or
stealing jobs from native-born workers. Poverty. While economic models do look
at relative wealth and income between home and destination countries, they do
not necessarily imply that unauthorized migrants are always impoverished by
standards of the home country. The poorest classes in a developing country may
lack the resources needed to mount an attempt to cross illegally, or the
connections to friends or family already in the destination country. Studies
from the Pew Hispanic Center have shown that the education and wage levels of
unauthorized Mexican immigrants in the US are around the median for Mexico, and
that having family who have emigrated or being from a community with many
emigrants is a much better predictor of one's choice to emigrate. Other
examples do show that increases in poverty, especially when associated with
immediate crises, can increase the likelihood of illegal migration. The 1994
economic crisis in Mexico, subsequent to the start of the North American Free
Trade Agreement (NAFTA), was associated with widespread poverty and a lower
valuation for the peso relative to the dollar. It also marked the start of a
massive swell in Mexican emigration, in which net illegal migration to the US
increased every year from the mid-1990s until the mid 2000s. There are also
examples where natural disasters and overpopulation can amplify poverty-driven
migration flows. Overpopulation. Population growth that exceeds the carrying
capacity of an area or environment results in overpopulation. Spikes in human
population can cause problems such as pollution, water crisis, and poverty.
World population has grown from 1.6 billion in 1900 to an estimated 7 billion
today. In Mexico alone, population has grown from 13.6 million in 1900 to 107
million in 2007. Virginia Abernethy notes that immigration is a road that
provides a "relief valve" to overpopulation that stops a population from
addressing the consequences of its overpopulation and that exports this
overpopulation to another location or country. In 2000, the United Nations
estimated that the world's population was growing at the rate of 1.14% (or
about 75 million people) per year. According to data from the CIA's World
Factbook, the world human population currently increases by 145 every minute.
The United States Census Bureau issued a revised forecast for world population
that increased its projection for the year 2050 to above 9.4 billion people, up
from 9.1 billion people. We are adding a billion more every 12 years. Almost
all growth will take place in the less developed regions. Family reunification.
Some unauthorized immigrants seek to live with loved ones, such as a spouse or
other family members. Family reunification visas may be applied for by legal
residents or naturalized citizens to bring their family members into a
destination state legally, but these visas may be limited in number and subject
to yearly quotas. This may force their family members to enter illegally to
reunify. From studying Mexican migration patterns, Douglas Massey finds that
the likelihood that a Mexican national will emigrate illegally to the US
increases dramatically if they have one or more family members already residing
in the United States, legally or illegally. Due to inability to marry, same-sex
couples in which one member has an expiring visa may face an "unpalatable
choice between leaving and living with the person they love in violation of
U.S. immigration laws". Wars and asylum. Unauthorized immigration may be
prompted by the desire to escape civil war or repression in the country of
origin. Non-economic push factors include persecution (religious and
otherwise), frequent abuse, bullying, oppression, and genocide, and risks to
civilians during war. Political motives traditionally motivate refugee flows
‚Äì to escape dictatorship for instance. The status of "unauthorized immigrant"
may coincide with or be replaced by the status of "asylum seeker" for emigrants
who have escaped a war or repression and have unlawfully crossed into another
state. If they are recognized as "legitimate" asylees by the destination state,
they will then gain status. However, there may be numerous potential asylees in
a destination state who are unwilling to apply or have been denied asylum
status, and hence are categorized as "unathorized immigrants" and may be
subject to punishment or deportation. However, Article 31 of the Convention
Relating to the Status of Refugees prohibits the Contracting States from
imposing penalties on refugees for their illegal enter or presence, who come
directly from a territory where their life or freedom are threatened. There are
numerous cases of mass emigration from poor or war-stricken states. These
include examples from Africa, Colombia, and El Salvador. After decades of armed
conflict, roughly one of every 10 Colombians now lives abroad. For example,
Colombians emigrating to Spain have "grown exponentially, from a little over
7,000 in 1993 to more than 80,000 in 2002 and 244,000 in 2003." Also, figures
from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security indicate that Colombia is the
fourth-leading source country of unauthorized immigration to the United States.
According to its estimates, the number of unauthorized Colombian residents in
the United States almost tripled from 51,000 in 1990 to 141,000 in 2000.
According to the US Census Bureau, the number of authorized Colombian
immigrants in the United States in 2000 was 801,363. Census data are important
because, as the Department of Homeland Security states, "census data are more
complete and reliable [than INS's data because of the national scope of the
data collection, the vastly larger data sample, and the extensive preparation
and follow-up activities involved in conducting the decennial census." El
Salvador is another country which experienced substantial emigration as a
result of civil war and repression. The largest per-capita source of immigrants
to the United States comes from El Salvador. Up to a third of the world's
Salvadoran-born population lives outside the country, mostly in the United
States. Problems. The problems with illegal immigration can be divided into
dangers faced by unauthorized immigrants and problems faced by the host or
receiving country. Unauthorized immigrants may expose themselves and citizens
of the nations they encroach upon to dangers while engaged in illegal entry
into another country. Aside from the possibility that they may be intercepted
and deported, some considerably more dangerous outcomes have been known to
result from their activity. As an example, unauthorized immigrants may be
trafficked for exploitation including sexual exploitation and some unauthorized
immigrants are involved in broader criminal activity. Slavery. After the end of
the legal international slave trade by the European nations and the United
States in the early 19th century, the illegal importation of slaves has
continued, albeit at much reduced levels. Although not as common as in Europe,
Asia, Africa and Latin America, some women are undoubtedly smuggled into the
United States and Canada. People have been kidnapped or tricked into slavery to
work as laborers, for example in factories. Those trafficked in this manner
often face additional barriers to escaping slavery, since their status as
unauthorized immigrants makes it difficult for them to gain access to help or
services. For example Burmese women trafficked into Thailand and forced to work
in factories or as prostitutes may not speak the language and may be vulnerable
to abuse by police due to their illegal immigrant status. Prostitution. Some
people forced into sexual slavery face challenges of charges of illegal
immigration. Since the fall of the Iron Curtain, Western Europe is being
confronted with a serious problem related to the sexual exploitation of
unauthorized immigrants (especially from Eastern Europe), for the purpose of
prostitution. Death. Each year there are several hundred illegal Immigrant
deaths along the U.S.-Mexico border. Death by exposure occurs in the deserts of
Southwestern United States during the hot summer season. Methods. Border
crossing. Immigrants from nations that do not have automatic visa agreements,
or who would not otherwise qualify for a visa, often cross the borders
illegally in some areas like the United States‚ÄìMexico border, the Mona
Channel between the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, the Strait of
Gibraltar, Fuerteventura, and the Strait of Otranto. Because these methods are
illegal, they are often dangerous. Would-be immigrants have been known to
suffocate in shipping containers, boxcars, and trucks, sink in shipwrecks
caused by unseaworthy vessels, die of dehydration or exposure during long walks
without water. An official estimate puts the number of people who died in
illegal crossings across the U.S.-Mexican border between 1998 and 2004 at 1,954
(see immigrant deaths along the U.S.-Mexico border). Human smuggling is the
practice of intermediaries aiding unauthorized immigrants in crossing over
international borders in financial gain, often in large groups. Human smuggling
differs from, but is sometimes associated with, human trafficking. A human
smuggler will facilitate illegal entry into a country for a fee, but on arrival
at their destination, the smuggled person is usually free. Trafficking involves
a process of using physical force, fraud, or deception to obtain and transport
people. Types of notorious human smugglers include Snakehead gangs present in
mainland China (especially in Fujian) that smuggle laborers into Pacific Rim
nations (making Chinatowns frequent centers of illegal immigration) and
"coyotes", who smuggle illegal immigrants to the Southwestern United States and
have been known to abuse or even kill their passengers. Sometimes immigrants
are abandoned by their human traffickers if there are difficulties, often dying
in the process. Others may be victims of intentional killing. Overstaying a
visa. Many unauthorized immigrants are migrants who originally arrive in a
country lawfully but overstay their authorized residence (overstaying a visa).
For example, most of the estimated 200,000 unauthorized immigrants in Canada
(perhaps as high as 500,000) are refugee claimants whose refugee applications
were rejected but who have not yet been expelled from the country. A related
way of becoming an unauthorized immigrant is through bureaucratic means. For
example, persons can be allowed to remain in a country or be protected from
expulsion because they need special pension for a medical condition, deep love
for a native, or even to avoid being tried for a crime in their native country,
without being able to regularize their situation and obtain a work and/or
residency permit, let alone naturalization. Hence, categories of people being
neither unauthorized immigrants nor local citizens are created, living in a
judicial "no man's land". Another example is formed by children of foreigners
born in countries observing "jus soli" ("right of territory"), such as was the
case in France until 1994 and in Ireland until 2005. In these countries, it was
possible to obtain French or Irish nationality (respectively) solely by being
born in France before 1994 or in Ireland before 2005 (respectively). At
present, a French born child of foreign parents does not automatically obtain
French nationality until residency duration conditions are met. Since 1 January
2005, a child born in Ireland does not automatically acquire Irish nationality
unless certain conditions are met. Legal and political status. Many countries
have had or currently have laws restricting immigration for economic or
nationalistic political reasons. United Nations Security Council Resolution
1373 concerning counter-terrorism, enacted in October 2001, requested of UN
member states to restrict immigration laws. Whether a person is permitted to
stay in a country legally may be decided by quotas or point systems or may be
based on considerations such as family ties (marriage, elderly mother, etc.).
Exceptions relative to political refugees or to sick people are also common.
Immigrants who do not participate in these legal proceedings or who are denied
permission under them and still enter or stay in the country are unauthorized
immigrants, as well as people born on national territory (henceforth not
"immigrants") but who have not obtained nationality of their birthplace and
have no legal title of residency. Most countries have laws requiring workers to
have proper documentation, often intended to prevent or minimize the employment
of unauthorized immigrants. However the penalties against employers are often
small and the acceptable identification requirements vague and ill-defined as
well as being seldom checked or enforced, making it easy for employers to hire
unauthorized labor. Unauthorized immigrants are especially popular with many
employers because they can pay less than the legal minimum wage or have unsafe
working conditions, secure in the knowledge that few unauthorized workers will
report the abuse to the authorities. Often the minimum wages in one country can
be several times the prevailing wage in the unauthorized immigrant's country,
making even these jobs attractive to the unauthorized worker. In response to
the outcry following popular knowledge of the Holocaust, the newly-established
United Nations held an international conference on refugees, where it was
decided that refugees (legally defined to be people who are persecuted in their
original country and then enter another country seeking safety) should be
exempted from immigration laws. It is, however, up to the countries involved to
decide if a particular immigrant is a refugee or not, and hence whether they
are subject to the immigration controls. The right to freedom of movement of an
individual within national borders is often contained within the constitution
or in a country's human rights legislation. Some argue that the freedom of
movement both within and between countries is a basic human right and that
nationalism and immigration policies of state governments violate this human
right that those same governments recognize within their own borders. According
to the article 13 on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, fundamental
human rights are violated when citizens are forbidden to leave their country.
However, immigrants are not assured the right to enter a country, that right is
given at the host country's discretion. Since unauthorized immigrants without
proper legal status have no valid identification documents such as identity
cards, they may have reduced or no access to public health systems, proper
housing, education and banks. This lack of access may result in the creation or
expansion of illegal underground forgery to provide this documentation. When
the authorities are overwhelmed in their efforts to stop "illegal" immigration,
they have historically provided amnesty. Amnesties waive the "subject to
deportation" clause associated with illegal aliens. By country or region.
Angola. In 2007 around 44,000 Congolese were forced to leave Angola. Since
2004, more than 400,000 unauthorized immigrants, almost all from the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, have been expelled from Angola. Australia. Official
government sources put the number of visa overstayers in Australia at
approximately 50,000. This has been the official number of unauthorized
immigrants for about 25 years and is considered to be low. Other sources have
placed it at up to 100,000, but no detailed study has been completed to
quantify this number, which could be significantly higher. Bhutan. Immigration
in Bhutan by Nepalese settlers (Lhotshampa) began slowly towards the end of the
19th century. The government passed the Bhutanese Citizenship Act 1985 to
clarify and try to enforce the Bhutanese Citizenship Act 1958 to control the
flood of illegal immigration. Those individuals who could not provide proof of
residency prior to 1958 were adjudged to be illegal immigrants. In 1991 and
1992, Bhutan expelled roughly 139,110 ethnic Nepalis, most of whom have been
living in seven refugee camps in eastern Nepal ever since. The United States
has offered to resettle 60,000 of the 107,000 Bhutanese refugees of Nepalese
origin now living in U.N. refugee camps in Nepal. The Bhutanese government,
even today, has not been able to sort the problem of giving citizenship to
those people who are married to Bhutanese, even though they have been in the
country for 40 years. Brazil. Brazil has long been part of international
migration routes. In 2009, the government estimated the number of unauthorized
immigrants at about 200,000 people; a Catholic charity working with immigrants
said there were 600,000 unauthorized immigrants (75,000 of which from Bolivia).
That same year, the Brazilian Parliament approved an amnesty, opening a six-
month window for all foreigners to seek legalization irrespective of their
previous standing before the law. Brazil had last legalized all immigrants in
1998; bilateral deals, one of which promoted the legalization of all reciprocal
immigrants with Bolivia to date, signed in 2005, are also common. Unauthorized
immigrants in Brazil enjoy the same legal privileges as native Brazilians
regarding access to social services such as public education and the Brazilian
public healthcare system. Most unauthorized immigrants in Brazil come from
Bolivia, Paraguay, Peru, China (mainly from Fujian), North Korea and sub-
Saharan Africa. A Federal Police operation investigated Chinese immigrants who
traveled through six countries before arriving in S√£o Paulo to work under
substandard conditions in the textile industry. After signing the 2009 amnesty
bill into law, President Lula said, in a speech, that "repression and
intolerance against immigrants will not solve the problems caused by the
economic crisis", thereby also harshly criticizing the "policy of
discrimination and prejudice" against immigrants in developed nations. An
October 2009 piece from O Globo, quoting a UNDP study, estimates the number of
unauthorized immigrants at 0.7 million, and points out to a recent wave of
xenophobia among the general populace. Canada. There is no credible information
available on unathorized immigration in Canada. Estimates range between 35,000
and 120,000 unauthorized immigrants in Canada. James Bissett, a former head of
the Canadian Immigration Service, has suggested that the lack of any credible
refugee screening process, combined with a high likelihood of ignoring any
deportation orders, has resulted in tens of thousands of outstanding warrants
for the arrest of rejected refugee claimants, with little attempt at
enforcement. Refugee claimants in Canada do not have to attempt re-entry to
learn the status of their claim. A 2008 report by the Auditor General Sheila
Fraser stated that Canada has lost track of as many as 41,000 unauthorized
immigrants. This number was predicted to increase drastically with the
expiration of temporary employer work permits issued in 2007 and 2008, which
were not renewed in many cases because of the shortage of work due to the
recession. Chile. Chile has recently become a new pole of attraction for
unauthorized immigrants, mostly from neighboring Peru and Bolivia but also
Ecuador, Paraguay and Haiti. According to the 2002 national census, Chile's
foreign-born foreign population has increased by 75% since 1992. People's
Republic of China. People's Republic of China is building a security barrier
along its border with North Korea to prevent the defectors or refugees from
North Korea. Also, many immigrants from Mongolia have tried to make it to
China. There might be as many as 100,000 Africans in Guangzhou, mostly illegal
overstayers. To encourage people to report foreigners living illegally in
China, the police is giving a 100 yuan reward to whistleblowers whose
information successfully leads to an expulsion. Dominican Republic. Dominican
Republic, an island nation shared with Haiti, has many unauthorized immigrants
coming from Haiti. Over a million unauthorized Haitian immigrants on Dominican
soil (over 10% of the total population). The loyalty of foreign nationals and
illegals can be questionable, especially when they do not consider the adopted
country as "their home." (See statement in "Victims" section) European Union.
The European Union is developing a common system for immigration and asylum and
a single external border control strategy. Many reports from local Greek
islands, near the Turkish coast indicate that Turks equip migrants with boats
and knives and tell them to cut the boat when they reach Greek waters. Greek
authorities are then forced to deal with the influx of thousands of
unauthorized immigrants under EU rules. According to a BBC report, over 80% of
the unauthorized immigrants entering the European Union now pass through
Greece. Greek police are unable to work with their counterparts in Turkey
because the Turkish army is responsible for their border. Recently, 14 illegal
migrants drowned because of Turkish traffickers who sent them into the sea,
telling them to slice the dinghies once they reach Greek waters. The Turkish
newspaper "H√ºrriyet" published stories once in July 2004 and a second time in
May 2006 that Hellenic Coast Guard ships were caught on film cruising as near
as a few hundred meters off the Turkish coast and abandoning clandestine
immigrants to the sea. This practice allegedly resulted in the drowning of six
people between Chios and Karaburun Peninsula on 26 September 2006 while three
others disappeared and 31 were saved by Turkish gendarmes and fishermen.
However, there are also numerous non-Turkish claims and testimonies that
Turkish authorities and/or citizens lead immigrants through the sea, often
resulting to the abandonment and sometimes drowning of said immigrants. A tough
new EU immigration law detaining illegal immigrants for up to 18 months before
deportation has triggered outrage across Latin America, with Venezuelan
President Hugo Ch√°vez threatening to cut off oil exports to Europe. United
Kingdom. There are between 550,000 and 950,000 unauthorized immigrants in the
United Kingdom, with a figure of 750,000 as the most likely number. The United
Kingdom is a difficult country to reach as it is mostly located on one island
and part of another, but traffickers in Calais, France have tried to smuggle
unauthorized immigrants into the UK. Many of the unauthorized immigrants come
from Africa and Asia. There are also many from Eastern Europe and Latin America
who are in the UK illegally, having overstayed their visas. Recently, a study
carried out by the University of Oxford's Centre on Migration, Policy and
Society (COMPAS) has estimated that there are 120,000 irregular migrant
children in the UK, of whom 65,000 born in the UK to parents without legal
status. The study shows that these children are at risk of destitution,
exploitation and social exclusion because of contradictory and frequently
changing rules and regulations which jeopardise their access to healthcare,
education, protection by the police and other public services. France. In
France, helping an unauthorized immigrant (providing shelter, for example) is
prohibited by a law passed on December 27, 1994. The law was heavily criticized
by non-governmental organizations such as Cimade and GISTI, left-wing political
parties such as the Greens and the French Communist Party, and trade-unions
such as the magistrates' "Syndicat de la magistrature". The linguistic
differentiations between anglophone and francophone rhetoric are important when
considering the topic of French illegal immigration. In French, the term
"irr√©guli√®re" is used (literally ‚Äúirregular‚Äù), whereas in English, the
term more often used is "illegal." Often, instead of referring to someone's
irregular immigrant status, the colloquial term used is "sans papiers"
(literally "without papers"), referring to the fact that irregular immigrants
do not possess papers from the French government allowing them to stay in
France. It is important to distinguish unauthorized immigrants from other forms
of immigrants and residents in France. Some immigrants to France are asylum-
seekers, and once granted asylum, they are no longer illegal/irregular, though
they are immigrants. There are also children who are born to immigrants in
France, who are not immigrants themselves, but they are still considered
foreigners by the French national government. One does not merely need to be a
foreign immigrant in order to be a foreigner in France. French citizenship is
based in the idea of political unity; therefore, French citizenship may be more
accessible than other EU countries, such as Germany and the UK. However, there
is also the strong feeling among French citizens that those non-native people
who gain French citizenship should also conform to the cultural aspects of
French life. French law prohibits anyone from assisting or trying to assist
"the entry, movement, or irregular stay of a foreigner in France." One found
guilty of these acts can be imprisoned for up to five years and fined
‚Ç¨30,000. There are also quotas for the number of arrests that should be made
in such cases: 5,000 arrests for 2009 and 5,500 arrests for 2011. France has an
Immigration Ministry (L'immigration, l'int√©gration, l'asile et le
d√©veloppement solidaire) which begun functioning in 2007 under President
Sarkozy. The goal of these quotas and laws put forth by the government is to
combat smugglers who profit financially from moving immigrants into, through,
and out of France, according to the Immigration Minister, Eric Besson. Calais
is an important site when considering unauthorized immigrants in France. This
is where many move go to try to cross the English Channel towards Great
Britain, the goal for many of them, as it is believed to be easier to gain
asylum or refugee status there. In Calais, when trying to pass through customs
towards Great Britain, truck drivers can be fined up to ‚Ç¨2,500 if
unauthorized immigrants are found on board their truck when it is searched.
There is an area of Calais known as "the Jungle", which houses many of the ones
who are waiting to get into Great Britain. There was a police raid here in
September 2009, which was seen as a political move by authorities to show their
efforts in public to control illegal immigration. Many non-governmental
organizations, such as Secours Catholique and the Red Cross are involved in the
situation as well. hese NGOs provide food, showers, and shelter to sans papiers
who gather waiting to cross the Channel. In 2002, then Interior Minister
Nicolas Sarkozy closed a Red Cross shelter in the Calais suburb of Sangette
that housed thousands of sans papiers in an effort to discourage them from
trying to cross the border. These immigrants simply moved to other parts of the
Calais region. Philippe Lefilleul, a member of Secours Cotholique, stated that
aid workers from these NGOs do not condone the illegal immigration of people to
France, but they feel that it is their "duty as fellow human beings and as
Christians" to help them. The French film "Welcome" is a portrayal of a sans
papiers young man trying to cross the English Channel from Calais and his
interactions with a swimming instructor in Calais. It was a controversial film
when it was released because it moves a very sensitive political and social
topic into a very important French cultural venu: ‚Äîfilm. Other French films
that address the topic of French immigration, especially illegal immigration,
are "Entre les murs" and "La Haine", which address cultural and political
situations surrounding immigration in Parisian suburbs and the country at
large. India. It is estimated that several million unauthorized immigrants live
in India. Precise figures are not available, but the numbers run from anywhere
from a few hundred thousand to 20 million. Especially in Eastern India, these
are mainly economic migrants from Bangladesh. India is constructing barriers on
its eastern borders to combat the surge of migrants. The Indo-Bangladeshi
barrier is 4,000¬ km (2,500¬ mi) long. Presently, India is constructing a fence
along the border to restrict illegal traffic from Bangladesh. This obstruction
will virtually isolate Bangladesh from India. The barrier's plan is based on
the designs of the Israeli West Bank barrier and will be 3.6¬ m (11.8¬ ft)
high. The stated aim of the fence is to stop infiltration of terrorists,
prevent smuggling, and end illegal immigration from Bangladesh. Iran. Since
late April 2007, the Iranian government has forcibly deported back to
Afghanistan mostly unregistered (and some registered) Afghans living and
working in Iran at a rate between 250,000 and 300,000 per year. The forceful
evictions of the refugees, who lived in Iran and Pakistan for nearly three
decades, are part of the two countries' larger plans to repatriate all Afghan
refugees within a few years. Iran says that it will send 1,000,000 by next
March, and Pakistan announced that all 2,400,000 Afghan refugees, most living
in camps, must return home by 2009. Experts say it will be "disastrous" for
Afghanistan. Israel. In a 2012 news story, "Reuters" reported, "Israel may jail
unauthorized immigrants for up to three years under a law put into effect on
Sunday, an Interior Ministry official said, a measure aimed at stemming the
flow of Africans entering Israel across the porous desert border with Egypt.
... Tens of thousands of migrants, mostly from Sudan and Eritrea, have arrived
in Israel in the past three years, and the pace has picked up to about 2,000 a
month since December, for a total of 60,000 since the influx began." Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that "This phenomenon is very grave and
threatens the social fabric of society, our national security and our national
identity." Libya. Libya is home to a large illegal Sub-Saharan African
population which numbers as much as 2,000,000. The mass expulsion plan to
summarily deport all undocumented foreigners was announced by Libyan leader
Colonel Muammar al-Gaddafi in January 2008. "No resident without a legal visa
will be excluded." Malaysia. There are an estimated 800,000 unauthorized
immigrants in Malaysia. In January 2009, Malaysia banned the hiring of foreign
workers in factories, stores and restaurants to protect its citizens from mass
unemployment amid the late 2000s recession. An ethnic Indian Malaysian was
recently sentenced to whipping and 10 months in prison for hiring six
unauthorized immigrants at his restaurant. "I think that after this, Malaysian
employers will be afraid to take in foreign workers (without work permits).
They will think twice", said immigration department prosecutor Azlan Abdul
Latiff. "This is the first case where an employer is being sentenced to
caning", he said. unauthorized immigrants also face caning before being
deported. Mexico. In the first six months of 2005 alone, more than 120,000
people from Central America have been deported to their countries of origin.
This is a significantly higher rate than in 2002, when for the entire year,
only 130,000 people were deported. Many women from Eastern Europe, Asia, and
Central and South America are also offered jobs at table dance establishments
in large cities throughout the country causing the National Institute of
Migration (INM) in Mexico to raid strip clubs and deport foreigners who work
without the proper documentation. Illegal immigration of Cubans through Canc√∫n
tripled from 2004 to 2006. In September 2007, Mexican President Calder√≥n
harshly criticized the United States government for the crackdown on
unauthorized immigrants, saying it has led to the persecution of immigrant
workers without visas. "I have said that Mexico does not stop at its border,
that wherever there is a Mexican, there is Mexico", he said. In October 2008,
Mexico tightened its immigration rules and agreed to deport Cubans who use the
country as an entry point to the US. It also criticized US policy that
generally allows Cubans who reach US territory to stay. Cuban Foreign Minister
said the Cuban-Mexican agreement would lead to "the immense majority of Cubans
being repatriated." In a 2010 news story, "USA Today" reported, "... Mexico's
Arizona-style law requires local police to check IDs. And Mexican police freely
engage in racial profiling and routinely harass Central American migrants, say
immigration activists." Nepal. In 2008, Nepal's Maoist-led government has
initiated a major crackdown against Tibetan exiles with the aim to deport to
China all Tibetans living illegally in the country. Tibetans started pouring in
Nepal after a failed anti-Chinese uprising in Tibet in 1959. Pakistan. As of
2005, 2.1% of the population of Pakistan had foreign origins, however the
number of immigrants population in Pakistan recently grew sharply. Immigrants
from South Asia make up a growing proportion of immigrants in Pakistan. The
five largest immigrant groups in Pakistan are in turn Afghans, Bangladeshi,
Tajiks, Uzbeks, Turkmens, Iranians, Indians, Sri Lankan, Burmese and Britons
including a sizeable number of those of Pakistani origin. Other significant
expatriate communities in the country are Armenians, Australians, Turks,
Chinese, Americans, Filipinos, Bosnians and many others. Migrants from
different countries of Arab world specially Egypt, Iraq, Palestine, Syria,
Kuwait, Libya, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen are in thousands. Nearly all illegal
migrants in Pakistan are Muslim refugees and they are accepted by the local
population. There is no political support or legislation to deport these
refugees from Pakistan. Russia. Russia experiences a constant flow of
immigration. On average, 200,000 legal immigrants enter the country every year;
about half are ethnic Russians from other republics of the former Soviet Union.
In addition, there are an estimated 10‚Äì12 million unauthorized immigrants in
the country. There has been a significant influx of ethnic Georgians,
Armenians, Azerbaijanis, Tajiks, and Uzbeks into big Russian cities in recent
years, which has been viewed very unfavorably by many citizens and contributed
to nationalist sentiments. Many immigrant ethnic groups have much higher birth
rates than native Russians, further shifting the balance. Some Chinese flee the
overpopulation and birth control regulations of their home country and settle
in the Far East and in southern Siberia. Russia's main Pacific port and naval
base of Vladivostok, once closed to foreigners, today is bristling with Chinese
markets, restaurants and trade houses. This has been occurring a lot since the
Soviet collapse. Illegal border crossing is considered a crime, and captured
illegal border crossers have been sentenced to a prison term. For example,
"Rossiyskaya Gazeta" reported in October 2008 the case of a North Korean who
was detained after illegally crossing the Amur River from China. Considered by
Russian authorities an "economic migrant", he was sentenced to 6 months in
prison and was to be deported to the country of his nationality after serving
his sentence, even though he may now risk an even heavier penalty there. That
was just one of the 26 cases year-to-date of illegal entrants, of various
nationalities, receiving criminal punishment in Amur Oblast. Saudi Arabia.
Saudi Arabia started construction of a separation barrier between its territory
and Yemen to prevent the unauthorized movement of people and goods into and out
of the kingdom. "See Saudi-Yemen barrier". In 2006, Saudi Arabia proposed plans
for the construction of a security fence along the entire length of its 560-
mile (900¬ km) desert border with Iraq in a multimillion-pound project to
secure the kingdom's borders in order to improve internal security, control
illegal immigration, and bolster its defences against external threats. South
Africa. South Africa is home to an estimated five million unauthorized
immigrants, including some three million Zimbabweans. Attacks on foreign
nationals increased markedly in late 2007 and it is believed that there have
been at least a dozen attacks since the start of 2008. The 2008 South Africa
riots atarted on May 11, 2008 against unauthorized immigrants, who are accused
of increasing the amount of crime and unemployment. see (Zimbabwean diaspora)
Syria. Since the US-led invasion of Iraq in March 2003, there are more refugees
from Iraq . The United Nations estimates that nearly 2,200,000 Iraqis have fled
the country since 2003, with nearly 100,000 fleeing to Syria and Jordan each
month. Most ventured to Jordan and Syria, creating demographic shifts that have
worried both governments. Refugees are mired in poverty as they are generally
barred from working in their host countries. Syrian authorities worried that
the new influx of refugees would limit the country's resources. Sources like
oil, heat, water and electricity were said to be becoming scarcer as demand
were rising. On October 1, 2007, news agencies reported that Syria reimposed
restrictions on Iraqi refugees, as stated by a spokesperson for the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Under Syria's new rules, only Iraqi
merchants, businessmen and university professors with visas acquired from
Syrian embassies may enter Syria. Turkey. Turkey receives many economic
migrants from nearby countries such as Azerbaijan, Georgia, Armenia, but also
from North Caucasus, Central Asia, Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Iraq War is
thought to have increased the flow of illegal immigration into Turkey, and the
global parties directly involved in the conflict have been accused of extending
a less-helping hand than Turkey itself to resolve the precarious situation of
immigrants stranded in passage. United States. Between 7 million and 20 million
unauthorized immigrants are estimated to be living in the United States but the
nature of illegal immigration makes the exact number be unknown. Estimates from
the Pew Hispanic Center show the number of unauthorized immigrants has declined
to 11.1 million in March 2009 from a peak of 12 million in March 2007. The
majority of the unauthorized immigrants are from Mexico. Illegal immigration
has been a longstanding issue in the United States, creating immense
controversy. Harvard University economist George J. Borjas explains that the
controversy centers around the "huge redistribution wealth away from U.S.
Citizen workers to employers who use illegal immigrants." In 2007, President
George W. Bush called for Congress to endorse his guest worker proposal,
stating that unauthorized immigrants took jobs that Americans would not take.
The Pew Hispanic Center notes that while the number of legal immigrants
(including LPRs, refugees, and asylum seekers) arriving has not varied
substantially since the 1980s, the number of unauthorized immigrants has
increased dramatically and, since the mid 1990s, has surpassed the number of
legal immigrants. Penalties for employers who hire unauthorized immigrants
range from $2,000‚Äì$10,000 and up to six months' imprisonment. However,
penalties for employers go largely unenforced. Political groups like Americans
for Legal Immigration have been formed to fight illegal immigration by
demanding that the US enforce immigration laws and secure the borders. However,
ALIPAC has also called for "safe departure" border checkpoints, free of
criminal checks, for illegal activities. In a 2011 news story, "Los Angeles
Times" reported, " ... illegal immigrants in 2010 were parents of 5.5 million
children, 4.5 million of whom were born in the U.S. and are citizens. Because
illegal immigrants are younger and more likely to be married, they represented
a disproportionate share of births ‚Äî 8% of the babies born in the U.S.
between March 2009 and March 2010 were to at least one illegal immigrant
parent." Immigration from Mexico to the United States has slowed in recent
years. In 2011, official Border Patrol statistics showed that apprehensions of
migrants along the U.S.-Mexico border had reached their lowest point in forty
years, indicating the fewer migrants were attempting to cross the border; in
2012, a Pew Hispanic Center report showed that from 1999-2000, over 700,000
Mexicans entered the United States, but by 2009 only about 150,000 entered. As
a 2011 report by the Washington Office on Latin America points out, the
lessened flow of migrants into the United States has been attributed to several
factors, including the slowing of the U.S. economy, the buildup in security
along the U.S.-Mexico border, and increased violence on the Mexican side of the
border. Puerto Rico. "See Dominican immigration to Puerto Rico#Illegal
immigration" Venezuela. An estimated 200,000 Colombians have fled the Colombian
civil war and sought safety in Venezuela. Most of them lack identity documents
and this hampers their access to services, as well as to the labor market. The
Venezuelan government has no specific policies on refugees. Further reading.
