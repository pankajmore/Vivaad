Race (human classification) Race is a classification system used to categorize
humans into large and distinct populations or groups by heritable phenotypic
characteristics, geographic ancestry, culture, history, language, physical
appearance, ethnicity, and social status. In the early twentieth century the
term was often used, in a taxonomic sense, to denote genetically differentiated
human populations defined by phenotype. While biologists sometimes use the
concept of race to make distinctions among fuzzy sets of traits, others in the
scientific community suggest that the idea of race is often used in a naive or
simplistic way, i.e. that among humans, race has no taxonomic significance: all
living humans belong to the same species, "Homo sapiens". Social conceptions
and groupings of races vary over time, involving folk taxonomies that define of
individuals based on perceived traits. Scientists consider biological
essentialism obsolete, and generally discourage racial explanations for
collective differentiation in both physical and behavioral traits. Since the
second half of the twentieth century the associations of race with the
ideologies and theories that grew out of the work of 19th-century
anthropologists and physiologists has led to the use of the word race itself
becoming problematic. Although still used in general contexts, it is now often
replaced by other words which are less emotionally charged, such as
populations, people(s), ethnic groups or communities depending on context.
Complications and various definitions of the concept. It is demonstrated that
race has no biological or genetic basis: gross morphological features which
traditionally has been defined as races (e.g. skin color) are determined by
non-significant and superficial genetic alleles with no link to any
characteristics, such as intelligence, talent, athletic ability, etc. Race has
been socially and legally constructed despite the lack of any scientific
evidence for dividing humanity into racial baskets with any generalized genetic
meaning. When people define and talk about a particular conception of race,
they create a social reality through which social categorization is achieved.
In this sense, races are said to be social constructs. These constructs develop
within various legal, economic, and sociopolitical contexts, and may be the
effect, rather than the cause, of major social situations. While race is
understood to be a social construct by many, most scholars agree that race has
real material effects in the lives of people through institutionalized
practices of preference and discrimination. Socioeconomic factors, in
combination with early but enduring views of race, have led to considerable
suffering within disadvantaged racial groups. Racial discrimination often
coincides with racist mindsets, whereby the individuals and ideologies of one
group come to perceive the members of an outgroup as both racially defined and
morally inferior. As a result, racial groups possessing relatively little power
often find themselves excluded or oppressed, while hegemonic individuals and
institutions are charged with holding racist attitudes. Racism has led to many
instances of tragedy, including slavery and genocide. In some countries Law
enforcement utilizes race in profiling suspects. These uses of racial
categories are frequently criticized for perpetuating an outmoded understanding
of human biological variation, and promoting stereotypes. Because in some
societies racial groupings correspond closely with patterns of social
stratification, for social scientists studying social inequality, race can be a
significant variable. As sociological factors, racial categories may in part
reflect subjective attributions, self-identities, and social institutions.
Scholars continue to debate the degrees to which racial categories are
biologically warranted and socially constructed, as well as the extent to which
the realities of race must be acknowledged in order for society to comprehend
and address racism adequately. Accordingly, the racial paradigms employed in
different disciplines vary in their emphasis on biological reduction as
contrasted with societal construction. In the social sciences theoretical
frameworks such as Racial formation theory and Critical race theory investigate
implications of race as social construction by exploring how the images, ideas
and assumptions of race are expressed in everyday life. A large body of
scholarship has traced the relationships between the historical, social
production of race in legal and criminal language and their effects on the
policing and disproportionate incarceration of certain groups. Historical
origins of racial classification. Groups of humans have probably always
identified themselves as distinct from other groups, but such differences have
not always been understood to be natural, immutable and global. These features
are the distinguishing features of how the concept of race is used today. The
word "race" was originally used to refer to any nations or ethnic groups. Marco
Polo in his 13th-century travels, for example, describes the Persian race‚Äîthe
current concept of "race" dates back only to the 17th century. Race and
colonialism. The European concept of "race", along with many of the ideas now
associated with the term, arose at the time of the scientific revolution, which
introduced and privileged the study of natural kinds, and the age of European
imperialism and colonization which established political relations between
Europeans and peoples with distinct cultural and political traditions. As
Europeans encountered people from different parts of the world, they speculated
about the physical, social, and cultural differences among various human
groups. The rise of the Atlantic slave trade, which gradually displaced an
earlier trade in slaves from throughout the world, created a further incentive
to categorize human groups in order to justify the subordination of African
slaves. Drawing on Classical sources and upon their own internal interactions
‚Äî for example, the hostility between the English and Irish was a powerful
influence on early European thinking about the differences between people ‚Äî
Europeans began to sort themselves and others into groups based on physical
appearance, and to attribute to individuals belonging to these groups behaviors
and capacities which were claimed to be deeply ingrained. A set of folk beliefs
took hold that linked inherited physical differences between groups to
inherited intellectual, behavioral, and moral qualities. Similar ideas can be
found in other cultures, for example in China, where a concept often translated
as "race" was associated with supposed common descent from the Yellow Emperor,
and used to stress the unity of ethnic groups in China. Brutal conflicts
between ethnic groups have existed throughout history and across the world.
Early taxonomic models. The first post-Classical published classification of
humans into distinct races seems to be Fran√ßois Bernier's "Nouvelle division
de la terre par les diff√©rents esp√®ces ou races qui l'habitent" ("New
division of Earth by the different species or races which inhabit it"),
published in 1684. In the 18th century, the differences among human groups
became a focus of scientific investigation. But the scientific classification
of phenotypic variation was frequently coupled with racist ideas about innate
predispositions of different groups, always attributing the most desirable
features to the White, European race and arranging the other races along a
continuum of progressively undesirable attributes. The 1735 classification of
Carolus Linnaeus, inventor of zoological taxonomy, divided the human race Homo
Sapiens continental varieties of Europaeus, Asiaticus, Americanus and Afer,
each associated with a different humour: sanguine, melancholic, choleric and
phlegmatic respectively. Homo Sapiens Europeaus was described as active, acute,
and adventurous whereas Homo Sapiens Afer was crafty, lazy and careless. The
1775 treatise "The Natural Varieties of Mankind," by Johann Friedrich
Blumenbach proposed five major divisions: the Caucasoid race, Mongoloid race,
Ethiopian race (later termed the Negroid race), American Indian race, and
Malayan race, but he did not propose any hierarchy among the races. Blumenbach
also noted the graded transition in appearances from one group to adjacent
groups and suggested that "one variety of mankind does so sensibly pass into
the other, that you cannot mark out the limits between them". From the 17th
through the 19th centuries, the merging of folk beliefs about group differences
with scientific explanations of those differences produced what one scholar has
called an "ideology of race". According to this ideology, races are primordial,
natural, enduring and distinct. It was further argued that some groups may be
the result of mixture between formerly distinct populations, but that careful
study could distinguish the ancestral races that had combined to produce
admixed groups. Subsequent influential classifications by Georges Buffon,
Petrus Camper and Christoph Meiners all classified "Negros" as inferior to
Europeans. In the United States the racial theories of Thomas Jefferson were
influential. He saw Africans as inferior to Whites especially in regards to
their intellect, and embued with unnatural sexual appetites, but described
Native Americans as equals to whites. Race and polygenism. In the last two
decades of the 18th century polygenism, the belief that different races had
evolved separately in each continent and shared no common ancestor, was
advocated in England by historian Edward Long and anatomist Charles White, in
Germany by ethnographers Christoph Meiners and Georg Forster, and in France by
Julien-Joseph Virey, and prominently in the US by Samuel Morton, Josiah Nott
and Louis Agassiz. Polygenism was popular and most widespread in the 19th
century, culminating in the creation of the Anthropological Society of London
during the American Civil War, in opposition to the Abolitionist Ethnological
Society. Modern debate. Models of human evolution. In a 1995 article, Leonard
Lieberman and Fatimah Jackson suggested that any new support for a biological
concept of race will likely come from the study of human evolution. They
therefore ask what, if any, implications current models of human evolution may
have for any biological conception of race. Today, all humans are classified as
belonging to the species "Homo sapiens" and sub-species "Homo sapiens sapiens".
However, this is not the first species of homininae: the first species of genus
"Homo", "Homo habilis", are theorized to have evolved in East Africa at least 2
million years ago, and members of this species populated different parts of
Africa in a relatively short time. "Homo erectus" is theorized to have evolved
more than 1.8 million years ago, and by 1.5 million years ago had spread
throughout Europe and Asia. Virtually all physical anthropologists agree that
"Homo sapiens" evolved out of African "Homo erectus" (("sensu lato") or "Homo
ergaster"). Most anthropologists believe that "Homo sapiens" evolved in East
Africa and then migrated out of Africa, replacing "H. erectus" populations
throughout Europe and Asia (the Out of Africa model). "Within" versus "between
group variation". The F(ST) or "genetic variation between versus within groups"
for human races is approximately 0.15. This is ample to satisfy taxonomic
significance. The F(ST) for humans and chimpanzees is 0.18. The attempt to
claim F(ST) invalidates the human race concept is known as "Lewontin's
Fallacy". However, Witherspoon "et al." 2007 concluded that Lewontin's
"Fallacy" is only a fallacy if one assumes the populations that individuals can
be assigned to are "races". They concluded the ability to assign an individual
to a specific population cluster with enough markers considered is perfectly
compatible with the fact it may still be possible for two randomly chosen
individuals from different populations/clusters to be more similar to each
other than to a randomly chosen member of their own cluster whilst still being
capable of being traced back to specific regions. Lieberman and Jackson argued
that while advocates of both the Multiregional Model and the Out of Africa
Model use the word race and make racial assumptions, none define the term. They
conclude that students of human evolution would be better off avoiding the word
race, and instead describe genetic differences in terms of populations and
clinal gradations. Subspecies. In the early 20th century, many anthropologists
accepted and taught the belief that biologically distinct races were isomorphic
with distinct linguistic, cultural, and social groups, while popularly applying
that belief to the field of eugenics, in conjunction with a practice that is
now called scientific racism. Following the Nazi eugenics program, racial
essentialism lost scientific credibility. Race anthropologists were pressured
to acknowledge findings coming from studies of culture and population genetics,
and to revise their conclusions about the sources of phenotypic variation. A
significant number of modern anthropologists and biologists in the West came to
view race as an invalid genetic or biological designation. The first to
challenge the concept of race on empirical grounds were anthropologists Franz
Boas, who demonstrated phenotypic plasticity due to environmental factors, and
Ashley Montagu who relied on evidence from genetics. E. O. Wilson then
challenged the concept from the perspective of general animal systematics, and
further rejected the claim that "races" were equivalent to "subspecies".
According to Jonathan Marks, In biology the term "race" is used with caution
because it can be ambiguous. Generally when it is used it is synonymous with
subspecies. For mammals, the taxonomic unit below the species level is usually
the subspecies. Morphologically differentiated populations. Traditionally,
subspecies are seen as geographically isolated and genetically differentiated
populations. That is, "the designation 'subspecies' is used to indicate an
objective degree of microevolutionary divergence" One objection to this idea is
that it does not specify what degree of differentiation is required. Therefore,
any population that is somewhat biologically different could be considered a
subspecies, even to the level of a local population. As a result, Templeton has
argued that it is necessary to impose a threshold on the level of difference
that is required for a population to be designated a subspecies. This
effectively means that populations of organisms must have reached a certain
measurable level of difference to be recognised as subspecies. Dean Amadon
proposed in 1949 that subspecies would be defined according to the seventy-five
percent rule which means that 75% of a population must lie outside 99% of the
range of other populations for a given defining morphological character or a
set of characters. The seventy-five percent rule still has defenders but other
scholars argue that it should be replaced with ninety or ninety-five percent
rule. In 1978, Sewall Wright suggested that human populations that have long
inhabited separated parts of the world should, in general, be considered
different subspecies by the usual criterion that most individuals of such
populations can be allocated correctly by inspection. Wright argued that it
does not require a trained anthropologist to classify an array of Englishmen,
West Africans, and Chinese with 100% accuracy by features, skin color, and type
of hair despite so much variability within each of these groups that every
individual can easily be distinguished from every other. However, it is
customary to use the term race rather than subspecies for the major
subdivisions of the human species as well as for minor ones. On the other hand
in practice subspecies are often defined by easily observable physical
appearance, but there is not necessarily any evolutionary significance to these
observed differences, so this form of classification has become less acceptable
to evolutionary biologists. Likewise this typological approach to race is
generally regarded as discredited by biologists and anthropologists. Sesardic
argues that when several traits are analyzed at the same time, forensic
anthropologists can classify a person's race with an accuracy of close to 100%
based on only skeletal remains. This is discussed in a later section.
Ancestrally differentiated populations. Cladistics is another method of
classification. A clade is a taxonomic group of organisms consisting of a
single common ancestor and all the descendants of that ancestor. Every creature
produced by sexual reproduction has two immediate lineages, one maternal and
one paternal. Whereas Carolus Linnaeus established a taxonomy of living
organisms based on anatomical similarities and differences, cladistics seeks to
establish a taxonomy‚Äîthe phylogenetic tree‚Äîbased on genetic similarities
and differences and tracing the process of acquisition of multiple
characteristics by single organisms. Some researchers have tried to clarify the
idea of race by equating it to the biological idea of the clade. Often
mitochondrial DNA or Y chromosome sequences are used to study ancient human
migration paths. These single-locus sources of DNA do not recombine and are
inherited from a single parent. Individuals from the various continental groups
tend to be more similar to one another than to people from other continents,
and tracing either mitochondrial DNA or non-recombinant Y-chromosome DNA
explains how people in one place may be largely derived from people in some
remote location. Often taxonomists prefer to use phylogenetic analysis to
determine whether a population can be considered a subspecies. Phylogenetic
analysis relies on the concept of derived characteristics that are not shared
between groups, usually applying to populations that are allopatric
(geographically separated) and therefore discretely bounded. This would make a
subspecies, evolutionarily speaking, a clade ‚Äì a group with a common
evolutionary ancestor population. The smooth gradation of human genetic
variation in general rules out any idea that human population groups can be
considered monophyletic (cleanly divided) as there appears to always have been
considerable gene flow between human populations. Rachel Caspari (2003) have
argued that clades are by definition monophyletic groups (a taxon that includes
"all" descendants of a given ancestor) and since no groups currently regarded
as races are monophyletic, none of those groups can be clades. For
anthropologists Lieberman and Jackson (1995), however, there are more profound
methodological and conceptual problems with using cladistics to support
concepts of race. They claim that "the molecular and biochemical proponents of
this model explicitly use racial categories "in their initial grouping of
samples"". For example, the large and highly diverse macroethnic groups of East
Indians, North Africans, and Europeans are presumptively grouped as Caucasians
prior to the analysis of their DNA variation. This is claimed to limit and skew
interpretations, obscure other lineage relationships, deemphasize the impact of
more immediate clinal environmental factors on genomic diversity, and can cloud
our understanding of the true patterns of affinity. They argue that however
significant the empirical research, these studies use the term race in
conceptually imprecise and careless ways. They suggest that the authors of
these studies find support for racial distinctions only because they began by
assuming the validity of race. "For empirical reasons we prefer to place
emphasis on clinal variation, which recognizes the existence of adaptive human
hereditary variation and simultaneously stresses that such variation is not
found in packages that can be labeled "races"." These scientists do not dispute
the importance of cladistic research, only its retention of the word race, when
reference to populations and clinal gradations are more than adequate to
describe the results. Clines. One crucial innovation in reconceptualizing
genotypic and phenotypic variation was anthropologist C. Loring Brace's
observation that such variations, insofar as it is affected by natural
selection, slow migration, or genetic drift, are distributed along geographic
gradations or . In part this is due to isolation by distance. This point called
attention to a problem common to phenotype-based descriptions of races (for
example, those based on hair texture and skin color): they ignore a host of
other similarities and differences (for example, blood type) that do not
correlate highly with the markers for race. Thus, anthropologist Frank
Livingstone's conclusion, that since clines cross racial boundaries, "there are
no races, only clines". In a response to Livingstone, Theodore Dobzhansky
argued that when talking about race one must be attentive to how the term is
being used: "I agree with Dr. Livingstone that if races have to be 'discrete
units,' then there are no races, and if 'race' is used as an 'explanation' of
the human variability, rather than vice versa, then the explanation is
invalid." He further argued that one could use the term race if one
distinguished between "race differences" and "the race concept." The former
refers to any distinction in gene frequencies between populations; the latter
is "a matter of judgment." He further observed that even when there is clinal
variation, "Race differences are objectively ascertainable biological
phenomena‚Ä¶ but it does not follow that racially distinct populations must be
given racial (or subspecific) labels." In short, Livingstone and Dobzhansky
agree that there are genetic differences among human beings; they also agree
that the use of the race concept to classify people, and how the race concept
is used, is a matter of social convention. They differ on whether the race
concept remains a meaningful and useful social convention. In 1964, biologists
Paul Ehrlich and Holm pointed out cases where two or more clines are
distributed discordantly‚Äîfor example, melanin is distributed in a decreasing
pattern from the equator north and south; frequencies for the haplotype for
beta-S hemoglobin, on the other hand, radiate out of specific geographical
points in Africa. As anthropologists Leonard Lieberman and Fatimah Linda
Jackson observed, "Discordant patterns of heterogeneity falsify any description
of a population as if it were genotypically or even phenotypically
homogeneous". More recent genetic studies indicate that skin color may change
radically over as few as 100 generations, or about 2,500 years, given the
influence of the environment. Genetically differentiated populations. Another
way to look at differences between populations is to measure genetic
differences rather than physical differences between groups. Mid-20th century
anthropologist William C. Boyd defined race as: "A population which differs
significantly from other populations in regard to the frequency of one or more
of the genes it possesses. It is an arbitrary matter which, and how many, gene
loci we choose to consider as a significant 'constellation'". Leonard Lieberman
and Rodney Kirk have pointed out that "the paramount weakness of this statement
is that if one gene can distinguish races then the number of races is as
numerous as the number of human couples reproducing." Moreover, anthropologist
Stephen Molnar has suggested that the discordance of clines inevitably results
in a multiplication of races that renders the concept itself useless. The Human
Genome Project states "People who have lived in the same geographic region for
many generations may have some alleles in common, but no allele will be found
in all members of one population and in no members of any other." Fixation
index. Population geneticist Sewall Wright developed one way of measuring
genetic differences between populations known as the Fixation index, which is
often abbreviated to "F"ST. This statistic is often used in taxonomy to compare
differences between any two given populations by measuring the genetic
differences among and between populations for individual genes, or for many
genes simultaneously. It is often stated that the fixation index for humans is
about 0.15. This translates to an estimated 85% of the variation measured in
the overall human population is found within individuals of the same
population, and about 15% of the variation occurs between populations. These
estimates imply that any two individuals from different populations are almost
as likely to be more similar to each other than either is to a member of their
own group. Richard Lewontin, who affirmed these ratios, thus concluded neither
"race" nor "subspecies" were appropriate or useful ways to describe human
populations. Others also noting that group variation was relatively low
compared to the variation observed in other mammalian species, agreed the
evidence confirmed the absence of natural subdivision of the human population.
>< end here--> Wright himself believed that values >0.25 represent very great
genetic variation and that an "F"ST of 0.15‚Äì0.25 represented great variation.
It should however be noted that about 5% of human variation occurs between
populations within continents, therefore "F"ST values between continental
groups of humans (or races) of as low as 0.1 (or possibly lower) have been
found in some studies, suggesting more moderate levels of genetic variation.
Graves (1996) has countered that "F"ST should not be used as a marker of
subspecies status, as the statistic is used to measure the degree of
differentiation between populations, although see also Wright (1978). In an
ongoing debate, some geneticists argue that race is neither a meaningful
concept nor a useful heuristic device, and even that genetic differences among
groups are biologically meaningless, because more genetic variation exists
within such races than among them, and that racial traits overlap without
discrete boundaries. Jeffrey Long and Rick Kittles give a long critique of the
application of "F"ST to human populations in their 2003 paper "Human Genetic
Diversity and the Nonexistence of Biological Races". They find that the figure
of 85% is misleading because it implies that all human populations contain on
average 85% of all genetic diversity. They claim that this does not correctly
reflect human population history, because it treats all human groups as
independent. A more realistic portrayal of the way human groups are related is
to understand that some human groups are parental to other groups and that
these groups represent paraphyletic groups to their descent groups. For
example, under the recent African origin theory the human population in Africa
is paraphyletic to all other human groups because it represents the ancestral
group from which all non-African populations derive, but more than that, non-
African groups only derive from a small non-representative sample of this
African population. This means that all non-African groups are more closely
related to each other and to some African groups (probably east Africans) than
they are to others, and further that the migration out of Africa represented a
genetic bottleneck, with much of the diversity that existed in Africa not being
carried out of Africa by the emigrating groups. This view produces a version of
human population movements that do not result in all human populations being
independent; but rather, produces a series of dilutions of diversity the
further from Africa any population lives, each founding event representing a
genetic subset of its parental population. Long and Kittles find that rather
than 85% of human genetic diversity existing in all human populations, about
100% of human diversity exists in a single African population, whereas only
about 70% of human genetic diversity exists in a population derived from New
Guinea. Long and Kittles argued that this still produces a global human
population that is genetically homogeneous compared to other mammalian
populations. Cluster analysis. In his 2003 paper, "", A. W. F. Edwards argued
that rather than using a locus-by-locus analysis of variation to derive
taxonomy, it is possible to construct a human classification system based on
characteristic genetic patterns, or "clusters" inferred from multilocus genetic
data. Geographically based human studies since have shown that such genetic
clusters can be derived from analyzing of a large number of loci which can
assort individuals sampled into groups analogous to traditional continental
racial groups. Joanna Mountain and Neil Risch cautioned that while genetic
clusters may one day be shown to correspond to phenotypic variations between
groups, such assumptions were premature as the relationship between genes and
complex traits remains poorly understood. However, Risch denied such
limitations render the analysis useless: "Perhaps just using someone's actual
birth year is not a very good way of measuring age. Does that mean we should
throw it out? ... Any category you come up with is going to be imperfect, but
that doesn't preclude you from using it or the fact that it has utility." Early
human genetic cluster analysis studies were conducted with samples taken from
ancestral population groups living at extreme geographic distances from each
other. It was thought that such large geographic distances would maximize the
genetic variation between the groups sampled in the analysis and thus maximize
the probability of finding cluster patterns unique to each group. In light of
the historically recent acceleration of human migration (and correspondingly,
human gene flow) on a global scale, further studies were conducted to judge the
degree to which genetic cluster analysis can pattern ancestrally identified
groups as well as geographically separated groups. One such study looked at a
large multiethnic population in the United States, and "detected only modest
genetic differentiation between different current geographic locales within
each race/ethnicity group. Thus, ancient geographic ancestry, which is highly
correlated with self-identified race/ethnicity‚Äîas opposed to current
residence‚Äîis the major determinant of genetic structure in the U.S.
population."() Anthropologists such as C. Loring Brace and philosopher Jonathan
Kaplan and geneticist Joseph Graves, have argued that while there it is
certainly possible to find biological and genetic variation that corresponds
roughly to the groupings normally defined as "continental races", this is true
for almost all geographically distinct populations. The cluster structure of
the genetic data is therefore dependent on the initial hypotheses of the
researcher and the populations sampled. When one samples continental groups the
clusters become continental, if one had chosen other sampling patterns the
clustering would be different. Weiss and Fullerton have noted that if one
sampled only Icelanders, Mayans and Maoris, three distinct clusters would form
and all other populations could be described as being clinally composed of
admixtures of Maori, Icelandic and Mayan genetic materials. Kaplan therefore
argues that seen in this way both Lewontin and Edwards are right in their
arguments. He concludes that while racial groups are characterized by different
allele frequencies, this does not mean that racial classification is a natural
taxonomy of the human species, because multiple other genetic patterns can be
found in human populations that crosscut racial distinctions. In this view
racial groupings are social constructions that also have a biological reality
which is largely an artefact of how the category has been constructed. Social
constructions. As anthropologists and other evolutionary scientists have
shifted away from the language of race to the term "population" to talk about
genetic differences, historians, cultural anthropologists and other social
scientists re-conceptualized the term "race" as a cultural category or social
construct‚Äîa particular way that some people talk about themselves and others.
Many social scientists have replaced the word race with the word "ethnicity" to
refer to self-identifying groups based on beliefs concerning shared culture,
ancestry and history. Alongside empirical and conceptual problems with "race,"
following the Second World War, evolutionary and social scientists were acutely
aware of how beliefs about race had been used to justify discrimination,
apartheid, slavery, and genocide. This questioning gained momentum in the 1960s
during the U.S. civil rights movement and the emergence of numerous anti-
colonial movements worldwide. They thus came to believe that race itself is a
social construct, a concept that was believed to correspond to an objective
reality but which was believed in because of its social functions. Craig Venter
and Francis Collins of the National Institute of Health jointly made the
announcement of the mapping of the human genome in 2000. Upon examining the
data from the genome mapping, Venter realized that although the genetic
variation within the human species is on the order of 1‚Äì3% (instead of the
previously assumed 1%), the types of variations do not support notion of
genetically defined races. Venter said, "Race is a social concept. It's not a
scientific one. There are no bright lines (that would stand out), if we could
compare all the sequenced genomes of everyone on the planet." "When we try to
apply science to try to sort out these social differences, it all falls apart."
Stephan Palmi√© asserted that race "is not a thing but a social relation"; or,
in the words of Katya Gibel Mevorach, "a metonym," "a human invention whose
criteria for differentiation are neither universal nor fixed but have always
been used to manage difference." As such, the use of the term "race" itself
must be analyzed. Moreover, they argue that biology will not explain why or how
people use the idea of race: History and social relationships will. Imani
Perry, a professor in the Center for African American Studies at Princeton
University, has made significant contributions to how we define race in America
today. Perry‚Äôs work focuses on how race is experienced. Perry tells us that
race, "is produced by social arrangements and political decision making." Perry
explains race more in stating, "race is something that happens, rather than
something that is. It is dynamic, but it holds no objective truth." The theory
that race is merely a social construct has been challenged by the findings of
researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine, published in the
"American Journal of Human Genetics" as "Genetic Structure, Self-Identified
Race/Ethnicity, and Confounding in Case-Control Association Studies". One of
the researchers, Neil Risch, noted: "we looked at the correlation between
genetic structure on microsatellite markers versus self-description, we found
99.9% concordance between the two. We actually had a higher discordance rate
between self-reported sex and markers on the X chromosome! So you could argue
that sex is also a problematic category. And there are differences between sex
and gender; self-identification may not be correlated with biology perfectly.
And there is sexism." Race and ethnicity. The distinction between race and
ethnicity is considered highly problematic. Ethnicity is often assumed to be
the cultural identity of a group from a nation state, while race is assumed to
be biological and/or cultural essentialization of a group hierarchy of
superiority/inferiority related to their biological constitution. It is assumed
that, based on power relations, there exist 'racialized ethnicities' and
'ethnicized races'. Ram√°n Grosfoguel (University of California, Berkeley)
notes that 'racial/ethnic identity' is one concept and that concepts of race
and ethnicity cannot be used as separate and autonomous categories. Brazil.
Compared to 19th century United States, 20th century Brazil was characterized
by a perceived relative absence of sharply defined racial groups. According to
anthropologist Marvin Harris, this pattern reflects a different history and
different social relations. Basically, race in Brazil was "biologized," but in
a way that recognized the difference between ancestry (which determines
genotype) and phenotypic differences. There, racial identity was not governed
by rigid descent rule, such as the one-drop rule, as it was in the United
States. A Brazilian child was never automatically identified with the racial
type of one or both parents, nor were there only a very limited number of
categories to choose from, to the extent that full siblings can pertain to
different racial groups. Over a dozen racial categories would be recognized in
conformity with all the possible combinations of hair color, hair texture, eye
color, and skin color. These types grade into each other like the colors of the
spectrum, and none category stands significantly isolated from the rest. That
is, race referred preferentially to appearance, not heredity, and appearance is
a poor indication of ancestry, because only a few genes are responsible for
someone's skin color and traits: a person who is considered white may have more
African ancestry than a person who is considered black, and the reverse can be
also true about European ancestry. The complexity of racial classifications in
Brazil reflects the extent of miscegenation in Brazilian society, a society
that remains highly, but not strictly, stratified along color lines. These
socioeconomic factors are also significant to the limits of racial lines,
because a minority of "pardos", or brown people, are likely to start declaring
themselves white or black if socially upward, and being seen as relatively
"whiter" as their perceived social status increases (much as in other regions
of Latin America). Fluidity of racial categories apart, the "biologification"
of race in Brazil referred above would match contemporary concepts of race in
the United States quite closely, though, if Brazilians are supposed to choose
their race as one among, Asian and Indigenous apart, three IBGE's census
categories. While assimilated Amerindians and people with very high quantities
of Amerindian ancestry are usually grouped as "caboclos", a subgroup of
"pardos" which roughly translates as both mestizo and hillbilly, for those of
lower quantity of Amerindian descent a higher European genetic contribution is
expected to be grouped as a "pardo". In several genetic tests, people with less
than 60-65% of European descent and 5-10% of Amerindian descent usually cluster
with Afro-Brazilians (as reported by the individuals), or 6.9% of the
population, and those with about 45% or more of Subsaharan contribution most
times do so (in average, Afro-Brazilian DNA was reported to be about 50%
Subsaharan African, 37% European and 13% Amerindian). If a more consistent
report with the genetic groups in the gradation of miscegenation is to be
considered (e.g. that would not cluster people with a balanced degree of
African and non-African ancestry in the black group instead of the multiracial
one, unlike elsewhere in Latin America where people of high quantity of African
descent tend to classify themselves as mixed), more people would report
themselves as white and "pardo" in Brazil (47.7% and 42.4% of the population as
of 2010, respectively), because by research its population is believed to have
between 65 and 80% of autosomal European ancestry, in average (also >35% of
European mt-DNA and >95% of European Y-DNA). This is not surprising, as it
should be noted that while the greatest number of slaves imported from Africa
were sent to Brazil, totalizing roughly 3.5 million people, they lived in such
miserable conditions that male African Y-DNA there is significantly rare due to
the lack of resources and time involved with raising of children, so that most
African descent originarily came from relations between white masters and
female slaves. From the last decades of the Empire until the 1950s, the
proportion of the white population increased significantly while Brazil
welcomed 5.5 million immigrants between 1821 and 1932, not much behind its
neighbor Argentina with 6.4 million, and it received more European immigrants
in its colonial history than the United States. Between 1500 and 1760, 700.000
Europeans settled in Brazil, while 530.000 Europeans settled in the United
States for the same given time. Thus, the historical construction of race in
Brazilian society dealt primarily with gradations between persons of
majoritarily European ancestry and little minority groups with otherwise lower
quantity therefrom in recent times. European Union. According to European Union
Council Directive, The European Union uses the terms racial origin and ethnic
origin synonymously in its documents and according to it ‚Äûthe use of the term
‚Äúracial origin‚Äù in this directive does not imply an acceptance of such
theories‚Äù. Haney L√≥pez warns that using ‚Äòrace‚Äô as a category within the
law tends to legitimize its existence in the popular imagination. In the
diverse geographic context of Europe, ethnicity and ethnic origin are arguably
more resonant and are less encumbered by the ideological baggage associated
with ‚Äòrace‚Äô. In European context, historical resonance of ‚Äòrace‚Äô
underscores its problematic nature. In some states, it is strongly associated
with laws promulgated by the Nazi and Fascist governments in Europe during the
1930s and 1940s. Indeed, in 1996, the European Parliament adopted a resolution
stating that ‚Äúthe term should therefore be avoided in all official texts‚Äù.
The concept of racial origin is inherently problematic, being grounded in the
scientiÔ¨Åcally false notion that human beings can be separated into
biologically distinct ‚Äòraces‚Äô. Since all human beings belong to the same
species, the ECRI (European Commission against Racism and Intolerance) rejects
theories based on the existence of different ‚Äòraces‚Äô. However, in its
Recommendation ECRI uses this term in order to ensure that those persons who
are generally and erroneously perceived as belonging to ‚Äòanother race‚Äô are
not excluded from the protection provided for by the legislation. The law
claims to reject the existence of ‚Äòrace‚Äô, yet penalize situations where
someone is treated less favourably on this ground. France. Since the end of the
Second World War, France has become an ethnically diverse country. Today,
approximately five percent of the French population is non-European and non-
white. This does not approach the number of non-white citizens in the United
States (roughly 15-25%, depending on how Latinos are classified). Nevertheless,
it amounts to at least three million people, and has forced the issues of
ethnic diversity onto the French policy agenda. France has developed an
approach to dealing with ethnic problems that stands in contrast to that of
many advanced, industrialized countries. Unlike the United States, Britain, or
even the Netherlands, France maintains a "color-blind" model of public policy.
This means that it targets virtually no policies directly at racial or ethnic
groups. Instead, it uses geographic or class criteria to address issues of
social inequalities. It has, however, developed an extensive anti-racist policy
repertoire since the early 1970s. Until recently, French policies focused
primarily on issues of hate speech‚Äîgoing much further than their American
counterparts-and relatively less on issues of discrimination in jobs, housing,
and in provision of goods and services. United States. The immigrants to the
Americas came from every region of Europe, Africa, and Asia. They mixed among
themselves and with the indigenous inhabitants of the continent. In the United
States most people who self-identify as African‚ÄìAmerican have some European
ancestors, while many people who identify as European American have some
African or Amerindian ancestors. Since the early history of the United States,
Amerindians, African‚ÄìAmericans, and European Americans have been classified
as belonging to different races. Efforts to track mixing between groups led to
a proliferation of categories, such as mulatto and octoroon. The criteria for
membership in these races diverged in the late 19th century. During
Reconstruction, increasing numbers of Americans began to consider anyone with
"one drop" of known "Black blood" to be Black, regardless of appearance.3 By
the early 20th century, this notion was made statutory in many states.4
Amerindians continue to be defined by a certain percentage of "Indian blood"
(called "blood quantum"). To be White one had to have perceived "pure" White
ancestry. The one-drop rule or hypodescent rule refers to the convention of
defining a person as racially black if he or she has any known African
ancestry. This rule meant that those that were mixed race but with some
discernable African ancestry were defined as black. The one-drop rule is
specific to not only those with African ancestry but to the United States,
making it a particularly African-American experience. The decennial censuses
conducted since 1790 in the United States created an incentive to establish
racial categories and fit people into those categories. The term "Hispanic" as
an ethnonym emerged in the 20th century with the rise of migration of laborers
from American Spanish-speaking countries to the United States. Today, the word
"Latino" is often used as a synonym for "Hispanic". The definitions of both
terms are non-race specific, and include people who consider themselves to be
of distinct races (Black, White, Amerindian, Asian, and mixed groups). However,
there is a common misconception in the US that Hispanic/Latino is a race or
sometimes even that national origins such as Mexican, Cuban, Colombian,
Salvadoran, etc. are races. In contrast to "Latino" or "Hispanic", "Anglo"
refers to non-Hispanic White Americans or non-Hispanic European Americans, most
of whom speak the English language but are not necessarily of English descent.
Current views across disciplines. In Poland, the race concept was rejected by
25 percent of anthropologists in 2001, although: "Unlike the U.S.
anthropologists, Polish anthropologists tend to regard race as a term without
taxonomic value, often as a substitute for population." Liberman et al. in a
2004 study claimed to "present the currently available information on the
status of the concept in the United States, the Spanish language areas, Poland,
Europe, Russia, and China. Rejection of race ranges from high to low with the
highest rejection occurring among anthropologists in the United States (and
Canada). Rejection of race is moderate in Europe, sizeable in Poland and Cuba,
and lowest in Russia and China." Methods used in the studies reported included
questionnaires and content analysis. Kaszycka et al. (2009) in 2002‚Äì2003
surveyed European anthropologists' opinions toward the biological race concept.
Three factors, country of academic education, discipline, and age, were found
to be significant in differentiating the replies. Those educated in Western
Europe, physical anthropologists, and middle-aged persons rejected race more
frequently than those educated in Eastern Europe, people in other branches of
science, and those from both younger and older generations."The survey shows
that the views of anthropologists on race are sociopolitically (ideologically)
influenced and highly dependent on education." United States views. One result
of debates over the meaning and validity of the concept of race is that the
current literature across different disciplines regarding human variation lacks
consensus, though within some fields, such as some branches of anthropology,
there is strong consensus. Some studies use the word race in its early
essentialist taxonomic sense. Many others still use the term race, but use it
to mean a population, clade, or haplogroup. Others eschew the concept of race
altogether, and use the concept of population as a less problematic unit of
analysis. U.S. anthropology. The concept of biological race has declined
significantly in frequency of use in physical anthropology in the United States
during the 20th century. A majority of physical anthropologists in the United
States have rejected the concept of biological races. Since 1932, an increasing
number of college textbooks introducing physical anthropology have rejected
race as a valid concept: from 1932 to 1976, only seven out of thirty-two
rejected race; from 1975 to 1984, thirteen out of thirty-three rejected race;
from 1985 to 1993, thirteen out of nineteen rejected race. According to one
academic journal entry, where 78 percent of the articles in the 1931 "Journal
of Physical Anthropology" employed these or nearly synonymous terms reflecting
a bio-race paradigm, only 36 percent did so in 1965, and just 28 percent did in
1996. The figure for physical anthropologists at PhD granting departments was
slightly higher, rising from 41% to 42%, with 50% agreeing. This survey,
however, did not specify any particular definition of race (although it did
clearly specify "biological race" within the "species" "Homo sapiens"); it is
difficult to say whether those who supported the statement thought of race in
taxonomic or population terms. A line of research conducted by Cartmill (1998),
however, seemed to limit the scope of Lieberman‚Äôs finding that there was "a
significant degree of change in the status of the race concept". Goran ≈ trkalj
has argued that this may be because Lieberman and collaborators had looked at
all the members of the American Anthropological Association irrespective of
their field of research interest, while Cartmill had looked specifically at
biological anthropologists interested in human variation. According to the 2000
edition of a popular physical anthropology textbook, forensic anthropologists
are overwhelmingly in support of the idea of the basic biological reality of
human races. Forensic physical anthropologist and professor George W. Gill has
said that the idea that race is only skin deep "is simply not true, as any
experienced forensic anthropologist will affirm" and "Many morphological
features tend to follow geographic boundaries coinciding often with climatic
zones. This is not surprising since the selective forces of climate are
probably the primary forces of nature that have shaped human races with regard
not only to skin color and hair form but also the underlying bony structures of
the nose, cheekbones, etc. (For example, more prominent noses humidify air
better.)" While he can see good arguments for both sides, the complete denial
of the opposing evidence "seems to stem largely from socio-political motivation
and not science at all". He also states that many biological anthropologists
see races as real yet "not one introductory textbook of physical anthropology
even presents that perspective as a possibility. In a case as flagrant as this,
we are not dealing with science but rather with blatant, politically motivated
censorship". In partial response to Gill's statement, Professor of Biological
Anthropology C. Loring Brace argues that the reason laymen and biological
anthropologists can determine the geographic ancestry of an individual can be
explained by the fact that biological characteristics are clinally distributed
across the planet, and that does not translate into the concept of race. He
states that "Well, you may ask, why can't we call those regional patterns
"races"? In fact, we can and do, but it does not make them coherent biological
entities. "Races" defined in such a way are products of our perceptions. ... We
realize that in the extremes of our transit‚ÄîMoscow to Nairobi,
perhaps‚Äîthere is a major but gradual change in skin color from what we
euphemistically call white to black, and that this is related to the
latitudinal difference in the intensity of the ultraviolet component of
sunlight. What we do not see, however, is the myriad other traits that are
distributed in a fashion quite unrelated to the intensity of ultraviolet
radiation. Where skin color is concerned, all the northern populations of the
Old World are lighter than the long-term inhabitants near the equator. Although
Europeans and Chinese are obviously different, in skin color they are closer to
each other than either is to equatorial Africans. But if we test the
distribution of the widely known ABO blood-group system, then Europeans and
Africans are closer to each other than either is to Chinese." "Race" is still
sometimes used within forensic anthropology (when analyzing skeletal remains),
biomedical research, and race-based medicine. Brace has criticized this, the
practice of forensic anthropologists for using the controversial concept "race"
out of convention when they in fact should be talking about regional ancestry.
He argues that while a forensic anthropologists can determine that a skeletal
remain comes from a person with ancestors in a specific region of Africa,
categorizing that skeletal as being "black" is a socially constructed category
that is only meaningful in the particular context of the United States, and
which is not itself scientifically valid. Other fields. In February 2001, the
editors of "Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine" asked "authors to
not use race and ethnicity when there is no biological, scientific, or
sociological reason for doing so." The editors also stated that "analysis by
race and ethnicity has become an analytical knee-jerk reflex." "Nature
Genetics" now ask authors to "explain why they make use of particular ethnic
groups or populations, and how classification was achieved." Liberman et al.
(1992) examined 77 college textbooks in biology and 69 in physical anthropology
published between 1932 and 1989. Physical anthropology texts argued that
biological races exist until the 1970s, when they began to argue that races do
not exist. In contrast, biology textbooks never underwent such a reversal but
instead dropped their discussion of race altogether. Morning (2008) looked at
high school biology textbooks during the 1952-2002 period and initially found a
similar pattern with only 35% directly discussing race in the 1983‚Äì92 period
from initially 92% doing so. However, this has increased somewhat after this to
43%. More indirect and brief discussions of race in the context of medical
disorders have increased from none to 93% of textbooks. In general, the
material on race has moved from surface traits to genetics and evolutionary
history. The study argues that the textbooks‚Äô fundamental message about the
existence of races has changed little. Gissis (2008) examined several important
American and British journals in genetics, epidemiology and medicine for their
content during the 1946-2003 period. He wrote that "Based upon my findings I
argue that the category of race only "seemingly" disappeared from scientific
discourse after World War II and has had a "fluctuating yet continuous use"
during the time span from 1946 to 2003, and has even "become more pronounced
from the early 1970s on"". A 1994 examination of 32 English sport/exercise
science textbooks found that 7 (21.9%) claimed that there are biophysical
differences due to race that might explain differences in sports performance,
24 (75%) did not mention nor refute the concept, and 1 (3.12%) expressed
caution with the idea. 33 health services researchers from differing geographic
regions were interviewed in a 2008 study. The researchers recognized the
problems with racial and ethnic variables but the majority still believed these
variables were necessary and useful. A 2010 examination of 18 widely used
English anatomy textbooks found that every one relied on the race concept. The
study gives examples of how the textbooks claim that anatomical features vary
between races. Intelligence. Researchers have reported differences in the
average IQ test scores of various ethnic groups. The interpretation, causes,
accuracy and reliability of these differences are highly controversial. Some
psychologists such as Arthur Jensen, and Richard Lynn, have argued that such
differences are at least partially genetic. Richard Herrnstein and Charles
Murray argue that "intelligence is less than completely heritable." Many other
researchers both in Psychology, Sociology and Anthropology, for example Thomas
Sowell, David F. Marks, Jonathan Marks, Richard Nisbett, argue that the
differences largely owe to social and economic inequalities. Still others such
as Stephen Jay Gould and Robert Sternberg have argued that categories such as
"race" and "intelligence" are both "folk" constructs rather than well defined
scientific concepts, and that since the definitions are largely fluid and
susceptible to different cultural constructions this in turn renders attempts
to explain variation of one in terms of the other scientifically invalid.
Political and practical uses. Biomedicine. In the United States, policy makers
use racially categorized data to identify and address health disparities
between racial or ethnic groups. In clinical settings, race has long been
considered in the diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions, because some
medical conditions are more prevalent in certain racial or ethnic groups than
in others. Recent interest in race-based medicine, or race-targeted
pharmacogenomics, has been fueled by the proliferation of human genetic data
which followed the decoding of the human genome in the early 2000s. There is an
active debate among biomedical researchers about the meaning and importance of
race in their research. Some researchers strongly support the continued use of
racial categorizations in biomedical research and clinical practice. They argue
that race may correlate, albeit imperfectly, with the presence of specific
genetic variants associated with disease: Insofar as race "provides a
sufficiently precise proxy for human genetic variation", the concept may be
medically viable. In addition, knowledge of a person's race may provide a cost-
effective way to assess susceptibility to genetically influenced medical
conditions. Detractors of race-based medicine acknowledge that race is
sometimes useful in clinical medicine, but encourage minimizing its use. They
suggest that medical practices should maintain their focus on the individual
rather than an individual's membership to any group. They argue that
overemphasizing genetic contributions to health disparities carries various
risks such as reinforcing stereotypes, promoting racism or ignoring the
contribution of non-genetic factors to health disparities. Some researchers in
the field have been accused "of using race as a placeholder during the
'meantime' of pharmacogenomic development". Conversely, it is argued that in
the early stages of the field's development, researchers must consider race-
related factors if they are to ascertain the clinical potentials of ongoing
scholarship. Law enforcement. In an attempt to provide general descriptions
that may facilitate the job of law enforcement officers seeking to apprehend
suspects, the United States FBI employs the term "race" to summarize the
general appearance (skin color, hair texture, eye shape, and other such easily
noticed characteristics) of individuals whom they are attempting to apprehend.
From the perspective of law enforcement officers, it is generally more
important to arrive at a description that will readily suggest the general
appearance of an individual than to make a scientifically valid categorization
by DNA or other such means. Thus, in addition to assigning a wanted individual
to a racial category, such a description will include: height, weight, eye
color, scars and other distinguishing characteristics. British Police use a
classification based in the ethnic background of British society: W1 (White-
British), W2 (White-Irish), W9 (Any other white background); M1 (White and
black Caribbean), M2 (White and black African), M3 (White and Asian), M9 (Any
other mixed background); A1 (Asian-Indian), A2 (Asian-Pakistani), A3 (Asian-
Bangladeshi), A9 (Any other Asian background); B1 (Black Caribbean), B2 (Black
African), B3 (Any other black background); O1 (Chinese), O9 (Any other). Some
of the characteristics that constitute these groupings are biological and some
are learned (cultural, linguistic, etc.) traits that are easy to notice. In
many countries, such as France, the state is legally banned from maintaining
data based on race, which often makes the police issue wanted notices to the
public that include labels like "dark skin complexion", etc. In the United
States, the practice of racial profiling has been ruled to be both
unconstitutional and a violation of civil rights. There is active debate
regarding the cause of a marked correlation between the recorded crimes,
punishments meted out, and the country's populations. Many consider "de facto"
racial profiling an example of institutional racism in law enforcement. The
history of misuse of racial categories to impact adversely one or more groups
and/or to offer protection and advantage to another has a clear impact on
debate of the legitimate use of known phenotypical or genotypical
characteristics tied to the presumed race of both victims and perpetrators by
the government. Mass incarceration in the United States disproportionately
impacts African American and Latino communities. Michelle Alexander, author of
The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness (2010),
argues that mass incarceration is best understood as not only a system of
overcrowded prisons. Mass incarceration is also, "the larger web of laws,
rules, policies, and customs that control those labeled criminals both in and
out of prison." She defines it further as "a system that locks people not only
behind actual bars in actual prisons, but also behind virtual bars and virtual
walls," illustrating the second-class citizenship that is imposed on a
disproportionate number of people of color, specifically African-Americans. She
compares mass incarceration to Jim Crow laws, stating that both work as racial
caste systems. Recent work using DNA cluster analysis to determine race
background has been used by some criminal investigators to narrow their search
for the identity of both suspects and victims. Proponents of DNA profiling in
criminal investigations cite cases where leads based on DNA analysis proved
useful, but the practice remains controversial among medical ethicists, defense
lawyers and some in law enforcement. Forensic anthropology. Similarly, forensic
anthropologists draw on highly heritable morphological features of human
remains (e.g. cranial measurements) to aid in the identification of the body,
including in terms of race. In a 1992 article anthropologist Norman Sauer noted
that Anthropologists had generally abandoned the concept of race as a valid
representation of human biological diversity except for Forensic
anthropologists. This lead him to ask "if races don't exist, why are forensic
anthropologists so good at identifying them?" He concluded that "the successful
assignment of race to a skeletal specimen is not a vindication of the race
concept, but rather a prediction that an individual, while alive was assigned
to a particular socially constructed ‚Äòracial‚Äô category. A specimen may
display features that point to African ancestry. In this country that person is
likely to have been labeled Black regardless of whether or not such a race
actually exists in nature. C. Loring Brace echoed this answer stating that:
"The simple answer is that, as members of the society that poses the question,
they are inculcated into the social conventions that determine the expected
answer. They should also be aware of the biological inaccuracies contained in
that "politically correct" answer. Skeletal analysis provides no direct
assessment of skin color, but it does allow an accurate estimate of original
geographical origins. African, eastern Asian, and European ancestry can be
specified with a high degree of accuracy. Africa of course entails "black," but
"black" does not entail African." Commercial determination of ancestry. New
research in molecular genetics, and the marketing of genetic identities through
the analysis of one's Y chromosome, mtDNA, or autosomal DNA to the general
public in the form of "Personalized Genetic Histories" (PGH) has caused debate.
Through these reports, advances in molecular genetics are used to create or
confirm stories have about social identities. Abu el-Haj argued that genetic
lineages, like older notions of race, suggest some idea of biological
relatedness, but unlike older notions of race they are not directly connected
to claims about human behaviour or character. She said that "postgenomics does
seem to be giving race a new lease on life." Abu el-Haj argues that genomics
and the mapping of lineages and clusters liberates "the new racial science from
the older one by disentangling ancestry from culture and capacity." As an
example, she refers to recent work by Hammer "et al.", which aimed to test the
claim that present-day Jews are more closely related to one another than to
neighbouring non-Jewish populations. Hammer "et al." found that the degree of
genetic similarity among Jews shifted depending on the locus investigated, and
suggested that this was the result of natural selection acting on particular
loci. They therefore focused on the non-recombining Y chromosome to "circumvent
some of the complications associated with selection". Stephan Palmi√© has
responded to Abu el-Haj's claim that genetic lineages make possible a new,
politically, economically, and socially benign notion of race and racial
difference by suggesting that efforts to link genetic history and personal
identity will inevitably "ground present social arrangements in a time-hallowed
past," that is, use biology to explain cultural differences and social
inequalities. One problem with these assignments is . Many people have a varied
ancestry. For example, in the United States, most people who self-identify as
African American have some European ancestors. In a survey of college students
who self-identified as "white" in a northeastern U.S. university, ~30% were
estimated to have <90% European ancestry. On the other hand, there are tests
that do not rely on molecular lineages, but rather on correlations between
allele frequencies, often when allele frequencies correlate these are called
clusters. These sorts of tests use informative alleles called Ancestry-
informative marker (AIM), which although shared across all human populations
vary a great deal in frequency between groups of people living in
geographically distant parts of the world. These tests use contemporary people
sampled from certain parts of the world as references to determine the likely
proportion of ancestry for any given individual. In a recent Public Service
Broadcasting (PBS) programme on the subject of genetic ancestry testing the
academic Henry Louis Gates: "wasn‚Äôt thrilled with the results (it turns out
that 50 percent of his ancestors are likely European)". Charles Rotimi, of
Howard University's National Human Genome Center, argued in 2003 that ‚Äîthat
"the nature or appearance of genetic clustering (grouping) of people is a
function of how populations are sampled, of how criteria for boundaries between
clusters are set, and of the level of resolution used" all bias the
results‚Äîand concluded that people should be very cautious about relating
genetic lineages or clusters to their own sense of identity. On the other hand,
Rosenberg (2005) argued that if enough genetic markers and subjects are
analyzed, then the clusters found are consistent. How many genetic markers a
commercial service uses likely varies, although new technology has continually
allowed increasing numbers to be analyzed.
