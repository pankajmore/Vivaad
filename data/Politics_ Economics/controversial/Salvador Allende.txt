Salvador Allende Salvador Allende Gossens (; 26 June 1908 ‚Äì 11 September
1973) was a Chilean physician and politician, known as the first Marxist to
become president of a Latin American country through open elections. Allende's
involvement in Chilean political life spanned a period of nearly forty years.
As a member of the Socialist Party, he was a senator, deputy and cabinet
minister. He unsuccessfully ran for the presidency in the 1952, 1958, and 1964
elections. In 1970, he won the presidency in a close three-way race, formally
elected by Congress as no candidate had gained a majority. Allende adopted the
policy of nationalization of industries and collectivization. On 11 September
1973 the military staged a coup against Allende. As the armed forces surrounded
La Moneda Palace, Allende gave his last speech vowing not to resign, and then
committed suicide. After Allende's death, Chile was led by a military junta
beginning a dictatorship led by General Augusto Pinochet. Early life. Allende
was born on 26 June 1908 in Valpara√≠so. He was the son of Salvador Allende
Castro and Laura Gossens Uribe. Allende's family belonged to the Chilean upper
class and had a long tradition of political involvement in progressive and
liberal causes. His grandfather was a prominent physician and a social
reformist who founded one of the first secular schools in Chile. Salvador
Allende was of Belgian and Basque descent. Allende attended high school at the
Liceo Eduardo de la Barra in Valpara√≠so. As a teenager, his main intellectual
and political influence came from the shoe-maker Juan De Marchi, an Italian-
born anarchist. Allende was a talented athlete in his youth, being a member of
the Everton de Vi√±a del Mar sports club (named after the more famous English
football club of the same name and which regularly competes at the highest
level in Chilean football), where he is said to have excelled at the long jump.
Allende then graduated with a medical degree in 1926 from the University of
Chile. He co-founded a section of the Socialist Party of Chile (founded in 1933
with Marmaduque Grove and others) in Valpara√≠so and became its chairman. He
married Hortensia Bussi with whom he had three daughters. In 1933, he published
his doctoral thesis "Higiene Mental y Delincuencia" (Crime and Mental Hygiene)
in which he criticized Cesare Lombroso's proposals. In 1938, Allende was in
charge of the electoral campaign of the Popular Front headed by Pedro Aguirre
Cerda. The Popular Front's slogan was "Bread, a Roof and Work!" After its
electoral victory, he became Minister of Health in the Reformist Popular Front
government which was dominated by the Radicals. While serving in this position,
Allende was responsible for the passage of a wide range of progressive social
reforms, including safety laws protecting workers in the factories, higher
pensions for widows, maternity care, and free lunch programmes for
schoolchildren. Upon entering the government, Allende relinquished his
parliamentary seat for Valpara√≠so, which he had won in 1937. Around that time,
he wrote "La Realidad M√©dico Social de Chile" ("The social and medical reality
of Chile"). After the Kristallnacht in Nazi Germany, Allende and other members
of the Parliament sent a telegram to Adolf Hitler denouncing the persecution of
Jews. Following President Aguirre Cerda's death in 1941, he was again elected
deputy while the Popular Front was renamed Democratic Alliance. In 1945,
Allende became senator for the Valdivia, Llanquihue, Chilo√©, Ais√©n and
Magallanes provinces; then for Tarapac√° and Antofagasta in 1953; for Aconcagua
and Valpara√≠so in 1961; and once more for Chilo√©, Ais√©n and Magallanes in
1969. He became president of the Chilean Senate in 1966. His three unsuccessful
bids for the presidency (in the 1952, 1958 and 1964 elections) prompted Allende
to joke that his epitaph would be "Here lies the next President of Chile." In
1952, as candidate for the "Frente de Acci√≥n Popular" (Popular Action Front,
FRAP), he obtained only 5.4% of the votes, partly due to a division within
socialist ranks over support for Carlos Ib√°√±ez. In 1958, again as the FRAP
candidate, Allende obtained 28.5% of the vote. This time, his defeat was
attributed to votes lost to the populist Antonio Zamorano. In 1964, once more
as the FRAP candidate, he lost again, polling 38.6% of the votes against 55.6%
for Christian Democrat Eduardo Frei. As it became clear that the election would
be a race between Allende and Frei, the political rightwhich initially had
backed Radical Julio Dur√°n‚Äì settled for Frei as "the lesser evil".
Relationship with the Chilean Communist Party. Allende had a close relationship
with the Chilean Communist Party from the beginning of his political career. On
his fourth (and successful) bid for the presidency, the Communist Party
appointed him as the alternate for its own candidate, the world-renowned poet
Pablo Neruda. During his presidential term, Allende took positions held by the
Communists, in opposition to the views of the socialists. Some argue, however,
that this was reversed at the end of his period in office. Election. Allende
won the 1970 Chilean presidential election as leader of the Unidad Popular
("Popular Unity") coalition. On 4 September 1970, he obtained a narrow
plurality of 36.2 percent to 34.9 percent over Jorge Alessandri, a former
president, with 27.8 percent going to a third candidate (Radomiro Tomic) of the
Christian Democratic Party (PDC), whose electoral platform was similar to
Allende's. According to the Chilean Constitution of the time, if no
presidential candidate obtained a majority of the popular vote, Congress would
choose one of the two candidates with the highest number of votes as the
winner. Tradition was for Congress to vote for the candidate with the highest
popular vote, regardless of margin. Indeed, former president Jorge Alessandri
had been elected in 1958 with only 31.6 percent of the popular vote, defeating
Allende. One month after the election, on 20 October, while the senate had
still to reach a decision and negotiations were actively in place between the
Christian Democrats and the Popular Unity, General Ren√© Schneider, Commander
in Chief of the Chilean Army, was shot resisting a kidnap attempt by a group
led by General Roberto Viaux. Hospitalized, he died of his wounds three days
later, on 23 October. Viaux's kidnapping plan had been supported by the CIA,
although the then U.S. National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger claims to have
ordered the plans postponed at the last moment. Many believe Kissinger's
statement to be false and evidence points towards CIA director Richard Helms
following orders directly from President Nixon to do whatever was necessary in
order ‚Äúto get rid of him‚Äù, referring to Allende. Nixon handed over a blank
check to Helms, which allowed him to use full discretion in ridding Chile of
Allende‚Äôs presence and ‚Äúmaking the economy scream‚Äù. Schneider was a
defender of the "constitutionalist" doctrine that the army's role is
exclusively professional, its mission being to protect the country's
sovereignty and not to interfere in politics. General Schneider's death was
widely disapproved of and, for the time, ended military opposition to Allende,
whom the parliament finally chose on 24 October. On 26 October, President
Eduardo Frei named General Carlos Prats as commander in chief of the army to
replace Ren√© Schneider. Allende assumed the presidency on 3 November 1970
after signing a "Statute of Constitutional Guarantees" proposed by the
Christian Democrats in return for their support in Congress. In an extensive
interview with R√©gis Debray in 1972, Allende explained his reasons for
agreeing to the guarantees. Some critics have interpreted Allende's responses
as an admission that signing the "Statute" was only a tactical move.
Presidency. Upon assuming power, Allende began to carry out his platform of
implementing a socialist programme called "La v√≠a chilena al socialismo" ("the
Chilean Path to Socialism"). This included nationalization of large-scale
industries (notably copper mining and banking), and government administration
of the health care system, educational system (with the help of an U.S.
educator, Jane A. Hobson-Gonzalez from Kokomo, Indiana), a programme of free
milk for children in the schools and shanty towns of Chile, and an expansion of
the land seizure and redistribution already begun under his predecessor Eduardo
Frei Montalva, who had nationalized between one-fifth and one-quarter of all
the properties listed for takeover. Allende also intended to improve the socio-
economic welfare of Chile's poorest citizens; a key element was to provide
employment, either in the new nationalised enterprises or on public work
projects. Allende‚Äôs first step in early 1971 was to raise minimum wages (in
real terms) for blue-collar workers by 37%-41% and 8%-10% for white-collar
workers. Educational, food, and housing assistance was significantly expanded,
with public-housing starts going up twelvefold and eligibility for free milk
extended from age 6 to age 15. A year later, blue-collar wages were raised by
27% in real terms and white-collar wages became fully indexed. Price controls
were also set up, while the Allende Government introduced a system of
distribution networks through various agencies (including local committees on
supply and prices) to ensure that the new rules were adhered to by shopkeepers.
The new Minister of Agriculture, Jacques Chonchol, promised to expropriate all
estates which were larger than eighty ‚Äúbasic‚Äù hectares. This promise was
kept, with no farm in Chile exceeding this limit by the end of 1972. The
Allende Government also sought to bring the arts (both serious and popular) to
the mass of the Chilean population by funding a number of cultural endeavours.
With eighteen-year olds and illiterates now granted the right to vote, mass
participation in decision-making was encouraged by the Allende government, with
traditional hierarchical structures now challenged by socialist egalitarianism.
The Allende Government was also able to draw upon the idealism of its
supporters, with teams of "Allendistas" travelling into the countryside and
shanty towns to perform volunteer work. Social spending was dramatically
increased, particularly for housing, education, and health, while a major
effort was made to redistribute wealth to poorer Chileans. As a result of new
initiatives in nutrition and health, together with higher wages, many poorer
Chileans were able to feed themselves and clothe themselves better than they
had been able to before. Public access to the social security system was
increased, while state benefits such as family allowances were raised
significantly. Chilean presidents were allowed a maximum term of six years,
which may explain Allende's haste to restructure the economy. Not only was a
major restructuring program organized (the "Vuskovic plan"), he had to make it
a success if a Socialist successor to Allende was going to be elected. In the
first year of Allende's term, the short-term economic results of Minister of
the Economy Pedro Vuskovic's expansive monetary policy were highly favorable:
12% industrial growth and an 8.6% increase in GDP, accompanied by major
declines in inflation (down from 34.9% to 22.1%) and unemployment (down to
3.8%). However by 1972, the Chilean "escudo" had an inflation rate of 140%. The
average Real GDP contracted between 1971 and 1973 at an annual rate of 5.6%
("negative growth"); and the government's fiscal deficit soared while foreign
reserves declined . The combination of inflation and government-mandated price-
fixing, together with the "disappearance" of basic commodities from supermarket
shelves, led to the rise of black markets in rice, beans, sugar, and flour. The
Chilean economy also suffered as a result of a US campaign against the Allende
government. The Allende government announced it would default on debts owed to
international creditors and foreign governments. Allende also froze all prices
while raising salaries. His implementation of these policies was strongly
opposed by landowners, employers, businessmen and transporters associations,
and some civil servants and professional unions. The rightist opposition was
led by National Party, the Roman Catholic Church (which in 1973 was displeased
with the direction of educational policy), and eventually the Christian
Democrats. There were growing tensions with foreign multinational corporations
and the government of the United States. Allende also undertook Project
Cybersyn, a system of networked telex machines and computers. Cybersyn was
developed by British cybernetics expert Stafford Beer. The network transmitted
data from factories to the government in Santiago, allowing for economic
planning in real-time. In 1971, Chile re-established diplomatic relations with
Cuba, joining Mexico and Canada in rejecting a previously-established
Organization of American States convention prohibiting governments in the
Western Hemisphere from establishing diplomatic relations with Cuba. Shortly
afterward, Cuban president Fidel Castro made a month-long visit to Chile.
Originally the visit was supposed to be one week, however Castro enjoyed Chile,
and one week turned to another. October 1972 saw the first of what were to be a
wave of strikes. The strikes were led first by truckers, and later by small
businessmen, some (mostly professional) unions and some student groups. Other
than the inevitable damage to the economy, the chief effect of the 24-day
strike was to induce Allende to bring the head of the army, general Carlos
Prats, into the government as Interior Minister. Allende also instructed the
government to begin requisitioning trucks in order to keep the nation from
coming to a halt. Government supporters also helped to mobilize trucks and
buses but violence served as a deterrent to full mobilization, even with police
protection for the strike breakers. Allende's actions were eventually declared
unlawful by the Chilean appeals court and the government was ordered to return
trucks to their owners. Throughout this presidency racial tensions between the
poor descendants of indigenous people, who supported Allende's reforms, and the
white settler elite increased. Allende raised wages on a number of occasions
throughout 1970 and 1971, but these wage hikes were negated by the in-tandem
inflation of Chile's fiat currency. Although price rises had also been high
under Frei (27% a year between 1967 and 1970), a basic basket of consumer goods
rose by 120% from 190 to 421 escudos in one month alone, August 1972. In the
period 1970‚Äì72, while Allende was in government, exports fell 24% and imports
rose 26%, with imports of food rising an estimated 149%. Export income fell due
to a hard hit copper industry: the price of copper on international markets
fell by almost a third, and post-nationalization copper production fell as
well. Copper is Chile's single most important export (more than half of Chile's
export receipts were from this sole commodity). The price of copper fell from a
peak of $66 per ton in 1970 to only $48‚Äì9 in 1971 and 1972. Chile was already
dependent on food imports, and this decline in export earnings coincided with
declines in domestic food production following Allende's agrarian reforms.
Throughout his presidency, Allende remained at odds with the Chilean Congress,
which was dominated by the Christian Democratic Party. The Christian Democrats
(who had campaigned on a socialist platform in the 1970 elections, but drifted
away from those positions during Allende's presidency, eventually forming a
coalition with the National Party), continued to accuse Allende of leading
Chile toward a Cuban-style dictatorship, and sought to overturn many of his
more radical policies. Allende and his opponents in Congress repeatedly accused
each other of undermining the Chilean Constitution and acting undemocratically.
Allende's increasingly bold socialist policies (partly in response to pressure
from some of the more radical members within his coalition), combined with his
close contacts with Cuba, heightened fears in Washington. The Nixon
administration continued exerting economic pressure on Chile via multilateral
organizations, and continued to back Allende's opponents in the Chilean
Congress. Almost immediately after his election, Nixon directed CIA and U.S.
State Department officials to "put pressure" on the Allende government. Foreign
relations during Allende's presidency. Allende's Popular Unity government tried
to maintain normal relations with the United States. When Chile nationalized
its copper industry, Washington cut off U.S. credits and increased its support
to opposition. Forced to seek alternative sources of trade and finance, Chile
gained commitments from the Soviet Union to invest some $400¬ million in Chile
in the next six years. Allende's government was disappointed that it received
far less economic assistance from the USSR than it hoped for. Trade between the
two countries did not significantly increase and the credits were mainly linked
to the purchase of Soviet equipment. Moreover, credits from the Soviet Union
were much less than those provided to the People's Republic of China and
countries of Eastern Europe. When Allende visited the USSR in late 1972 in
search of more aid and additional lines of credit, after 3 years of political
and economic failure and chaos, he was turned down. Foreign involvement in
Chile during Allende's Presidency. US involvement. The possibility of Allende
winning Chile's 1970 election was deemed a disaster by a US administration
which wanted to protect US business interests and prevent any spread of
Communism during the Cold War. In September 1970, President Nixon informed the
CIA that an Allende government in Chile would not be acceptable and authorized
$10¬ million to stop Allende from coming to power or unseat him. Henry
Kissinger's 40 Committee and the CIA planned to impede Allende's investiture as
President of Chile with covert efforts known as ""Track I"" and ""Track II"";
"Track I" sought to prevent Allende from assuming power via so-called
"parliamentary trickery", while under the "Track II" initiative, the CIA tried
to convince key Chilean military officers to carry out a coup. During Nixon's
presidency, U.S. officials attempted to prevent Allende's election by financing
political parties aligned with opposition candidate Jorge Alessandri and
supporting strikes in the mining and transportation sectors. After the 1970
election, the Track I operation attempted to incite Chile's outgoing president,
Eduardo Frei Montalva, to persuade his party (PDC) to vote in Congress for
Alessandri. Under the plan, Alessandri would resign his office immediately
after assuming it and call new elections. Eduardo Frei would then be
constitutionally able to run again (since the Chilean Constitution did not
allow a president to hold two consecutive terms, but allowed multiple non-
consecutive ones), and presumably easily defeat Allende. The Chilean Congress
instead chose Allende as President, on the condition that he would sign a
"Statute of Constitutional Guarantees" affirming that he would respect and obey
the Chilean Constitution, and that his reforms would not undermine any of its
elements. "Track II" was aborted, as parallel initiatives already underway
within the Chilean military rendered it moot. During the second term of office
of Democratic President Bill Clinton, the CIA acknowledged having played a role
in Chilean politics prior to the coup, but its degree of involvement is
debated. The CIA was notified by its Chilean contacts of the impending coup two
days in advance, but contends it "played no direct role in" the coup. Much of
the internal opposition to Allende's policies came from business sector, and
recently-released U.S. government documents confirm that the U.S. indirectly
funded the truck drivers' strike, which exacerbated the already chaotic
economic situation prior to the coup. The most prominent U.S. corporations in
Chile prior to Allende's presidency were the Anaconda and Kennecott copper
companies, and ITT Corporation, International Telephone and Telegraph. Both the
copper corporations aimed to expand privatized copper production in the city of
El Teniente in the Chilean Andes, the world's largest underground copper mine.
At the end of 1968, according to US Department of Commerce data, U.S. corporate
holdings in Chile amounted to $964¬ million. Anaconda and Kennecott accounted
for 28% of U.S. holdings, but ITT had by far the largest holding of any single
corporation, with an investment of $200¬ million in Chile. In 1970, before
Allende was elected, ITT owned 70% of Chitelco, the Chilean Telephone Company
and funded El Mercurio, a Chilean right-wing newspaper. Documents released in
2000 by the CIA confirmed that before the elections of 1970, ITT gave $700,000
to Allende's conservative opponent, Jorge Alessandri, with help from the CIA on
how to channel the money safely. ITT president Harold Geneen also offered
$1¬ million to the CIA to help defeat Allende in the elections. After General
Pinochet assumed power, United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger told
President Richard Nixon that the U.S. ""didn't do it,"" but ""we helped
them...created the conditions as great as possible."" (referring to the coup
itself). Recent documents declassified under the Clinton administration's Chile
Declassification Project show that the United States government and the CIA
sought the overthrow of Allende in 1970 immediately before he took office
("Project FUBELT"). Many documents regarding the U.S. intervention in Chile
remain classified. Soviet involvement. Material based on reports from the
Mitrokhin Archive, the KGB said of Allende that "he was made to understand the
necessity of reorganising Chile's army and intelligence services, and of
setting up a relationship between Chile's and the USSR's intelligence
services". It is also claimed that Allende was given $30,000 "in order to
solidify the trusted relations" with him. According to Vasili Mitrokhin, a
former KGB major and senior archivist in the KGB intelligence central KGB
office in the Yasenevo area of Moscow, Allende made a personal request for
Soviet money through his personal contact, KGB officer Svyatoslav Kuznetsov
(codenamed LEONID), who urgently came to Chile from Mexico City to help
Allende. The original allocation of money for these elections through the KGB
was $400,000, a personal subsidy of $50,000 was sent directly to Allende, with
an additional $100,000 funneled through funds provided to the Chilean Communist
Party. Historian Christopher Andrew has argued that help from the KGB was a
decisive factor, because Allende won by a narrow margin of 39,000 votes of a
total of the 3 million cast. After the elections, the KGB director Yuri
Andropov obtained permission for additional money and other resources from the
Central Committee of the CPSU to ensure an Allende victory in Congress. In his
request on 24 October, he stated that the KGB "will carry out measures designed
to promote the consolidation of Allende's victory and his election to the post
of President of the country". In his KGB file, Allende was reported to have
"stated his willingness to co-operate on a confidential basis and provide any
necessary assistance, since he considered himself a friend of the Soviet
Union". He willingly shared political information. Andrew writes that regular
Soviet contact with Allende after his election was maintained by his KGB case
officer, Svyatoslav Kuznetsov, who was instructed by KGB's the 'Centre' to
"exert a favorable influence on Chilean government policy". Allende was said to
have reacted "positively." Political and moral support came mostly through the
Communist Party and unions. For instance, Allende received the Lenin Peace
Prize from the Soviet Union in 1972. However, there were some fundamental
differences between Allende and Soviet political analysts who believed that
some violence ‚Äì or measures that those analysts "theoretically considered to
be just" ‚Äì should have been used. According to Andrew's account of the
Mitrokhin archives, "In the KGB's view, Allende's fundamental error was his
unwillingness to use force against his opponents. Without establishing complete
control over all the machinery of the State, his hold on power could not be
secure." Declarations from KGB General Nikolai Leonov, former Deputy Chief of
the First Chief Directorate of the KGB, confirmed that the Soviet Union
supported Allende's government economically, politically and militarily. Leonov
stated in an interview at the Chilean Center of Public Studies (CEP) that the
Soviet economic support included over $100¬ million in credit, three fishing
ships (that distributed 17,000 tons of frozen fish to the population),
factories (as help after the 1971 earthquake), 3,100 tractors, 74,000 tons of
wheat and more than a million tins of condensed milk. In mid-1973 the USSR had
approved the delivery of weapons (artillery, tanks) to the Chilean Army.
However, when news of an attempt from the Army to depose Allende through a coup
d'√©tat reached Soviet officials, the shipment was redirected to another
country. Crisis. On 29 June 1973, Colonel Roberto Souper surrounded the
presidential palace, La Moneda, with his tank regiment but failed to depose the
government. That failed "coup d‚Äô√©tat" ‚Äì known as the "Tanquetazo" ("tank
putsch") ‚Äì organised by the nationalist "Patria y Libertad" paramilitary
group, was followed by a general strike at the end of July that included the
copper miners of El Teniente. In August 1973, a constitutional crisis occurred,
and the Supreme Court of Chile publicly complained about the inability of
Allende government to enforce the law of the land. On 22 August, the Chamber of
Deputies (with the Christian Democrats uniting with the National Party) accused
the government of unconstitutional acts through Allende's refusal to promulgate
constitutional amendments, already approved by the Chamber, which would have
prevented his government from continuing his massive nationalization plan and
called upon the military to enforce constitutional order. For months, Allende
had feared calling upon the "Carabineros" ("Carabineers", the national police
force), suspecting them of disloyalty to his government. On 9 August, President
Allende appointed General Carlos Prats as Minister of Defence. On 24 August
1973, General Prats was forced to resign both as defense minister and as the
commander-in-chief of the army, embarrassed by both the Alejandrina Cox
incident and a public protest in front of his house by the wives of his
generals. General Augusto Pinochet replaced him as Army commander-in-chief the
same day. According to Chilean political scientist Arturo Valenzuela (later
becoming a U.S. citizen and Assistant Secretary of State for Hemispheric
Affairs in the Obama administration), a greater share of the blame for the
breakdown in Chilean democracy lays with the leftist Allende government. While
the both sides became increasingly distrustful of the other, the extreme
leftists accelerated the process and left less room for political moderatism
more than the extreme rightists. He writes "By its actions, the revolutionary
Left, which had always ridiculed the possibility of a socialist transformation
through peaceful means, was engaged in a self-fulfilling prophecy." Supreme
Court's resolution. On 26 May 1973, the Supreme Court of Chile unanimously
denounced the Allende government's disruption of the legality of the nation in
its failure to uphold judicial decisions, because of its continual refusal to
permit police execution of judicial decisions contrary to the government's own
measures. Chamber of Deputies' resolution. On 22 August 1973, the Christian
Democrats and the National Party members of the Chamber of Deputies joined
together to vote 81 to 47 in favor of a resolution that asked the authorities
to "put an immediate end" to "breachof the Constitution . . . with the goal of
redirecting government activity toward the path of law and ensuring the
Constitutional order of our Nation, and the essential underpinnings of
democratic co-existence among Chileans." The resolution declared that Allende's
government sought "to conquer absolute power with the obvious purpose of
subjecting all citizens to the strictest political and economic control by the
State . . . the goal of establishing . . . a totalitarian system" and claimed
that the government had made "violations of the Constitution . . . a permanent
system of conduct." Essentially, most of the accusations were about disregard
by the Socialist government of the separation of powers, and arrogating
legislative and judicial prerogatives to the executive branch of government.
Finally, the resolution condemned the creation and development of government-
protected armed groups, which . . . are headed towards a confrontation with the
armed forces. President Allende's efforts to re-organize the military and the
police forces were characterized as "notorious attempts to use the armed and
police forces for partisan ends, destroy their institutional hierarchy, and
politically infiltrate their ranks". President Allende's response. Two days
later, on 24 August 1973, President Allende responded, characterising the
Congress's declaration as "destined to damage the country‚Äôs prestige abroad
and create internal confusion", predicting "It will facilitate the seditious
intention of certain sectors". He noted that the declaration (passed 81‚Äì47 in
the Chamber of Deputies) had not obtained the two-thirds Senate majority
"constitutionally required" to convict the president of abuse of power:
essentially, the Congress were "invoking the intervention of the armed forces
and of Order against a democratically-elected government" and "subordinat
political representation of national sovereignty to the armed institutions,
which neither can nor ought to assume either political functions or the
representation of the popular will". Allende argued he had obeyed
constitutional means for including military men to the cabinet at the service
of civic peace and national security, defending republican institutions against
insurrection and terrorism. In contrast, he said that Congress was promoting a
"coup d‚Äô√©tat" or a civil war with a declaration full of affirmations that
had already been refuted beforehand and which, in substance and process
(directly handing it to the ministers rather than directly handing it to the
President) violated a dozen articles of the (then-current) Constitution. He
further argued that the legislature was usurping the government's executive
function. President Allende wrote: "Chilean democracy is a conquest by all of
the people. It is neither the work nor the gift of the exploiting classes, and
it will be defended by those who, with sacrifices accumulated over generations,
have imposed it . . . With a tranquil conscience . . . I sustain that never
before has Chile had a more democratic government than that over which I have
the honor to preside . . . I solemnly reiterate my decision to develop
democracy and a state of law to their ultimate consequences . . . Parliament
has made itself a bastion against the transformations . . . and has done
everything it can to perturb the functioning of the finances and of the
institutions, sterilizing all creative initiatives". Adding that economic and
political means would be needed to relieve the country's current crisis, and
that the Congress were obstructing said means; having already paralyzed the
State, they sought to destroy it. He concluded by calling upon the workers, all
democrats and patriots to join him in defending the Chilean Constitution and
the revolutionary process. The coup. In early September 1973, Allende floated
the idea of resolving the constitutional crisis with a plebiscite. His speech
outlining such a solution was scheduled for 11 September, but he was never able
to deliver it. On 11 September 1973, the Chilean military staged a coup against
Allende. Death. Just prior to the capture of La Moneda (the Presidential
Palace), with gunfire and explosions clearly audible in the background, Allende
gave his farewell speech to Chileans on live radio, speaking of himself in the
past tense, of his love for Chile and of his deep faith in its future. He
stated that his commitment to Chile did not allow him to take an easy way out,
and he would not be used as a propaganda tool by those he called "traitors" (he
refused an offer of safe passage), clearly implying he intended to fight to the
end. Shortly afterwards, the coup plotters announced that Allende committed
suicide. An official announcement declared that he had committed suicide with
an automatic rifle. Prior to his death he had been photographed several times
holding an AK-47, a gift from Fidel Castro. He was found dead with this gun. In
his 2004 documentary "Salvador Allende", Patricio Guzm√°n incorporates a
graphic image of Allende's corpse in the position it was found after his death.
According to Guzm√°n's documentary, Allende shot himself with a pistol and not
a rifle. For years, the Chilean left-wing maintained that Allende had been
assassinated, considering that a suicide would weaken Allende's figure. His
doctor, Jos√© Quiroga, witness of Allende's suicide, who kept silence for a
long time, said ‚ÄúIt was more important the political issue of everybody
believing that Allende had been killed by the military‚Äù. In recent years the
view that he committed suicide has become more broadly accepted, particularly
as different testimonies appear to confirm details of the suicide reported in
news and documentary interviews. His personal doctor described the death as a
suicide, and his family accepts the finding. The theory that he was
assassinated persists and is referenced in the Michael Moore film "Bowling for
Columbine". In 2011, the controversy over the cause of death was reopened as
the subject of an official investigation. On the basis of the original 1973
autopsy, Luis Ravanal, a medical examiner, expressed the opinion that the
wounds on the body were not consistent with the theses of the alleged
witnesses, as there were wounds caused by different guns. In January 2011, a
Chilean judge ordered an inquiry, the first judicial investigation of the
death. On 23 May 2011, Allende's body was exhumed in order to have an autopsy
performed by an international forensic team. On 31 May, TVN, the state
television station, reported the discovery of a secret 300-page military
account of Allende's death. The document had been kept in the home of a former
military justice official, and was discovered when his house was destroyed in
the 2010 earthquake. After reviewing the report, two forensic experts told TVN
"that they are inclined to conclude that Allende was assassinated." This belief
is supported by forensic expert Luis Ravanal who has been studying Allende's
autopsy since 2007. Ravanal says he found details in the autopsy that were not
in line with the official version of Allende's death. The cranium, he says,
shows evidence of a first shot with a small gun, like a pistol, and then, a
second shot from a larger weapon ‚Äî like an AK-47 ‚Äî which could mean that
Allende was shot and killed, then shot a second time with his own gun, to make
it look like suicide. Chile's Legal Medical Service confirmed on 19 July 2011
that the death was suicide, consistent with the beliefs of Allende's family.
Dr. Patricio Bustos, the director of Chile's LMS, described the conclusions as
"definitive". Briton David Prayer, an expert in ballistics, stated that the
former president died as the result of two gunshots wounds which came from an
assault rifle placed between his legs and aimed at his chin. The scientific
autopsy team delivered a unanimous finding that Allende used an AK-47 rifle
given to him by Fidel Castro. The gun was set to fire automatically and the
shots tore off the top of his head, killing him instantly. Family. Well-known
relatives of Salvador Allende include his daughter Isabel Allende (politician)
and a cousin Isabel Allende (author). Memorials. Memorials to Allende include a
statue in front of the Palacio de la Moneda.
