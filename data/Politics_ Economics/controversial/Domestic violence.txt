Domestic violence Domestic violence, also known as domestic abuse, spousal
abuse, battering, family violence, and intimate partner violence (IPV), is
defined as a pattern of abusive behaviors by one partner against another in an
intimate relationship such as marriage, dating, family, or cohabitation.
Domestic violence, so defined, has many forms, including physical aggression or
assault (hitting, kicking, biting, shoving, restraining, slapping, throwing
objects), or threats thereof; sexual abuse; emotional abuse; controlling or
domineering; intimidation; stalking; passive/covert abuse (e.g., neglect); and
economic deprivation. Alcohol consumption and mental illness can be co-morbid
with abuse, and present additional challenges in eliminating domestic violence.
Awareness, perception, definition and documentation of domestic violence
differs widely from country to country, and from era to era. Domestic violence
and abuse is not limited to obvious physical violence. Domestic violence can
also mean endangerment, criminal coercion, kidnapping, unlawful imprisonment,
trespassing, harassment, and stalking. Definitions. According to the Merriam-
Webster dictionary definition, domestic violence is: "the inflicting of
physical injury by one family or household member on another; also: a repeated
/ habitual pattern of such behavior." These other forms of abuse have the
potential to lead to mental illness, self-harm, and even attempts at suicide.
Government definitions. The US Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) defines
domestic violence as a "pattern of abusive behavior in any relationship that is
used by one partner to gain or maintain power and control over another intimate
partner". The definition adds that domestic violence "can happen to anyone
regardless of race, age, sexual orientation, religion, or gender", and can take
many forms, including physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional, economic, and
psychological abuse. Dynamics classification. Violence by a person against
their intimate partner is often done as a way for controlling their partner,
even if this kind of violence is not the most frequent. Many types of intimate
partner violence occur, including violence between gay and lesbian couples, and
by women against their male partners. Intimate partner violence types. Michael
P. Johnson argues for four major types of intimate partner violence, which is
supported by subsequent research and evaluation. as well as independent
researchers. Types of male batterers identified by Holtzworth-Munroe and Stuart
(1994) include "family-only", which primarily fall into the CCV type, who are
generally less violent and less likely to perpetrate psychological and sexual
abuse. Other. Others, such as the US Centers for Disease Control, divide
domestic violence into two types: reciprocal, in which both partners are
violent, and non-reciprocal violence, in which one partner is violent; it is
possible that the former is more common Forms. All forms of domestic abuse have
one purpose: to "gain and maintain control" over the victim. Abusers use many
tactics to exert power over their spouse or partner: dominance, humiliation,
isolation, threats, intimidation, denial and blame. Physical. Physical abuse is
abuse involving contact intended to cause feelings of intimidation, pain,
injury, or other physical suffering or bodily harm. Physical abuse includes
hitting, slapping, punching, choking, pushing, burning and other types of
contact that result in physical injury to the victim. Physical abuse can also
include behaviors such as denying the victim of medical care when needed,
depriving the victim of sleep or other functions necessary to live, or forcing
the victim to engage in drug/alcohol use against his/her will. If a person is
suffering from any physical harm then they are experiencing physical abuse.
This pain can be experienced on any level. It can also include inflicting
physical injury onto other targets, such as children or pets, in order to cause
psychological harm to the victim. Sexual. Sexual abuse is any situation in
which force or threat is used to obtain participation in unwanted sexual
activity. Coercing a person to engage in sexual activity against their will,
even if that person is a spouse or intimate partner with whom consensual sex
has occurred, is an act of aggression and violence. Marital rape, also known as
spousal rape, is non-consensual sex in which the perpetrator is the victim's
spouse. As such, it is a form of partner rape, of domestic violence, and of
sexual abuse. In the US spousal rape is illegal in all 50 states. In Canada,
spousal rape was outlawed in 1983, when several legal changes were made,
including changing the rape statute to "sexual assault", and making the laws
gender neutral. All Australian states had outlawed marital rape from 1992
onwards. New Zealand outlawed spousal rape in 1985, and Ireland in 1990. In
England and Wales, spousal rape was made illegal in 1991, when the marital rape
exemption was abolished by the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords, in
the case of "R v R". Emotional. Emotional abuse (also called psychological
abuse or mental abuse) can include humiliating the victim privately or
publicly, controlling what the victim can and cannot do, withholding
information from the victim, deliberately doing something to make the victim
feel diminished or embarrassed, isolating the victim from friends and family,
implicitly blackmailing the victim by harming others when the victim expresses
independence or happiness, or denying the victim access to money or other basic
resources and necessities. Degradation in any form can be considered
psychological abuse. Emotional abuse can include verbal abuse and is defined as
any behavior that threatens, intimidates, undermines the victimâ€™s self-worth
or self-esteem, or controls the victimâ€™s freedom. This can include
threatening the victim with injury or harm, telling the victim that they will
be killed if they ever leave the relationship, and public humiliation. Constant
criticism, name-calling, and making statements that damage the victimâ€™s self-
esteem are also common verbal forms of emotional abuse. Often perpetrators will
use children to engage in emotional abuse by teaching them to harshly criticize
the victim as well. Emotional abuse includes conflicting actions or statements
which are designed to confuse and create insecurity in the victim. These
behaviors also lead the victims to question themselves, causing them to believe
that they are making up the abuse or that the abuse is their fault. Emotional
abuse includes forceful efforts to isolate the victim, keeping them from
contacting friends or family. This is intended to eliminate those who might try
to help the victim leave the relationship and to create a lack of resources for
them to rely on if they were to leave. Isolation results in damaging the
victimâ€™s sense of internal strength, leaving them feeling helpless and unable
to escape from the situation. People who are being emotionally abused often
feel as if they do not own themselves; rather, they may feel that their
significant other has nearly total control over them. Women or men undergoing
emotional abuse often suffer from depression, which puts them at increased risk
for suicide, eating disorders, and drug and alcohol abuse. Verbal. Verbal abuse
is a form of emotionally abusive behavior involving the use of language. Verbal
abuse can also be referred to as the act of threatening. Through threatening a
person can blatantly say they will harm you in any way and will also be
considered as abuse. It may include profanity but can occur with or without the
use of expletives. Verbal abuse may include aggressive actions such as name-
calling, blaming, ridicule, disrespect, and criticism, but there are also less
obviously aggressive forms of verbal abuse. Statements that may seem benign on
the surface can be thinly veiled attempts to humiliate; falsely accuse; or
manipulate others to submit to undesirable behavior, make others feel unwanted
and unloved, threaten others economically, or isolate victims from support
systems. In Jekyll and Hyde behaviors, the abuser may fluctuate between sudden
rages and false joviality toward the victim; or may simply show a very
different "face" to the outside world than to the victim. While oral
communication is the most common form of verbal abuse, it includes abusive
communication in written form. Economic. Economic abuse is a form of abuse when
one intimate partner has control over the other partner's access to economic
resources. Economic abuse may involve preventing a spouse from resource
acquisition, limiting the amount of resources to use by the victim, or by
exploiting economic resources of the victim. The motive behind preventing a
spouse from acquiring resources is to diminish victim's capacity to support
him/herself, thus forcing him/her to depend on the perpetrator financially,
which includes preventing the victim from obtaining education, finding
employment, maintaining or advancing their careers, and acquiring assets. In
addition, the abuser may also put the victim on an allowance, closely monitor
how the victim spends money, spend victim's money without his/her consent and
creating debt, or completely spend victim's savings to limit available
resources Effects. On children. 3.3 million children witness domestic violence
each year in the US. There has been an increase in acknowledgment that a child
who is exposed to domestic abuse during their upbringing will suffer in their
developmental and psychological welfare. Because of the awareness of domestic
violence that some children have to face, it also generally impacts how the
child develops emotionally, socially, behaviorally as well as cognitively. Some
emotional and behavioral problems that can result due to domestic violence
include increased aggressiveness, anxiety, and changes in how a child
socializes with friends, family, and authorities. Depression, as well as self-
esteem issues, can follow due to traumatic experiences. Problems with attitude
and cognition in schools can start developing, along with a lack of skills such
as problem-solving. Correlation has been found between the experience of abuse
and neglect in childhood and perpertrating domestic violence and sexual abuse
in adulthood. Additionally, in some cases the abuser will purposely abuse the
mother or father in front of the child to cause a ripple effect, hurting two
victims simultaneously. It has been found that children who witness mother-
assault are more likely to exhibit symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder
(PTSD). Consequences to these children are likely to be more severe if their
assaulted mother develops posttruamatic stress disorder (PTSD) and does not
seek treatment due to her difficulty in assisting her child with processing his
or her own experience of witnessing the domestic violence. Family Violence
prevention in Australia and other countries has begun to focus on breaking
intergenerational cycles, according to the National (Aust) Standards for
Working with Children Exposed to Family Violence it is important to acknowledge
that exposing children to Family Violence is child abuse. Some of the effects
of Family Violence on children are highlighted in the Queensland Government and
SunnyKids awareness raising campaign. Physical. Bruises, broken bones, head
injuries, lacerations, and internal bleeding are some of the acute effects of a
domestic violence incident that require medical attention and hospitalization.
Some chronic health conditions that have been linked to victims of domestic
violence are arthritis, irritable bowel syndrome, chronic pain, pelvic pain,
ulcers, and migraines. Victims who are pregnant during a domestic violence
relationship experience greater risk of miscarriage, pre-term labor, and injury
to or death of the fetus. Psychological. Among victims who are still living
with their perpetrators high amounts of stress, fear, and anxiety are commonly
reported. Depression is also common, as victims are made to feel guilty for
â€˜provokingâ€™ the abuse and are frequently subjected to intense criticism. It
is reported that 60% of victims meet the diagnostic criteria for depression,
either during or after termination of the relationship, and have a greatly
increased risk of suicidality. In addition to depression, victims of domestic
violence also commonly experience long-term anxiety and panic, and are likely
to meet the diagnostic criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Panic
Disorder. The most commonly referenced psychological effect of domestic
violence is Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). PTSD (as experienced by
victims) is characterized by flashbacks, intrusive images, exaggerated startle
response, nightmares, and avoidance of triggers that are associated with the
abuse. These symptoms are generally experienced for a long span of time after
the victim has left the dangerous situation. Many researchers state that PTSD
is possibly the best diagnosis for those suffering from psychological effects
of domestic violence, as it accounts for the variety of symptoms commonly
experienced by victims of trauma. Financial. Once victims leave their
perpetrator, they can be stunned with the reality of the extent to which the
abuse has taken away their autonomy. Due to economic abuse and isolation, the
victim usually has very little money of their own and few people on whom they
can rely when seeking help. This has been shown to be one of the greatest
obstacles facing victims of DV, and the strongest factor that can discourage
them from leaving their perpetrators. In addition to lacking financial
resources, victims of DV often lack specialized skills, education, and training
that are necessary to find gainful employment, and also may have several
children to support. In 2003, thirty-six major US cities cited DV as one of the
primary causes of homelessness in their areas. It has also been reported that
one out of every three homeless women are homeless due to having left a DV
relationship. If a victim is able to secure rental housing, it is likely that
her apartment complex will have "zero tolerance" policies for crime; these
policies can cause them to face eviction even if they are the victim (not the
perpetrator) of violence. While the number of shelters and community resources
available to DV victims has grown tremendously, these agencies often have few
employees and hundreds of victims seeking assistance which causes many victims
to remain without the assistance they need. Long-term. Domestic violence can
trigger many different responses in victims, all of which are very relevant for
any professional working with a victim. Major consequences of domestic violence
victimization include psychological/mental health issues and chronic physical
health problems. A victimâ€™s overwhelming lack of resources can lead to
homelessness and poverty. On responders. Vicarious trauma. Due to the gravity
and intensity of hearing victimsâ€™ stories of abuse, professionals (social
workers, police, counselors, therapists, advocates, medical professionals) are
at risk themselves for secondary or vicarious trauma (VT), which causes the
responder to experience trauma symptoms similar to the original victim after
hearing about the victimâ€™s experiences with abuse. Research has demonstrated
that professionals who experience vicarious trauma show signs of exaggerated
startle response, hypervigilance, nightmares, and intrusive thoughts although
they have not experienced a trauma personally and do not qualify for a clinical
diagnosis of PTSD. Researchers concluded that although clinicians have
professional training and are equipped with the necessary clinical skills to
assist victims of domestic violence, they may still be personally affected by
the emotional impact of hearing about a victimâ€™s traumatic experiences.
Iliffe et al. found that there are several common initial responses that are
found in clinicians who work with victims: loss of confidence in their ability
to help the client, taking personal responsibility for ensuring the clientâ€™s
safety, and remaining supportive of the clientâ€™s autonomy if they make the
decision to return to their perpetrator. It has also been shown that clinicians
who work with a large number of victims may alter their former perceptions of
the world, and begin to doubt the basic goodness of others. Iliffe et al. found
that clinicians who work with victims tend to feel less secure in the world,
become "acutely aware" of power and control issues both in society and in their
own personal relationships, have difficulty trusting others, and experience an
increased awareness of gender-based power differences in society. The best way
for a clinician to avoid developing VT is to engage in good self-care
practices. These can include exercise, relaxation techniques, debriefing with
colleagues, and seeking support from supervisors. Additionally, it is
recommended that clinicians make the positive and rewarding aspects of working
with domestic violence victims the primary focus of thought and energy, such as
being part of the healing process or helping society as a whole. Clinicians
should also continually evaluate their empathic responses to victims, in order
to avoid feelings of being drawn in to the trauma that the victim experienced.
It is recommended that clinicians practice good boundaries, and find a balance
in expressing empathic responses to the victim while still maintaining personal
detachment from their traumatic experiences. Burnout. Vicarious trauma can lead
directly to burnout, which is defined as "emotional exhaustion resulting from
excessive demands on energy, strength, and personal resources in the work
setting". The physical warning signs of burnout include headaches, fatigue,
lowered immune function, and irritability. A clinician experiencing burnout may
begin to lose interest in the welfare of clients, be unable to empathize or
feel compassion for clients, and may even begin to feel aversion toward the
client. If the clinician experiencing burnout is working with victims of
domestic violence, the clinician risks causing further great harm through re-
victimization of the client. It should be noted, however, that vicarious trauma
does not always directly lead to burnout and that burnout can occur in
clinicians who work with any difficult populationÂ â€“ not only those who work
with domestic violence victims. Causes. There are many different theories as to
the causes of domestic violence. These include psychological theories that
consider personality traits and mental characteristics of the perpetrator, as
well as social theories which consider external factors in the perpetrator's
environment, such as family structure, stress, social learning. As with many
phenomena regarding human experience, no single approach appears to cover all
cases. Whilst there are many theories regarding what causes one individual to
act violently towards an intimate partner or family member there is also
growing concern around apparent intergenerational cycles of domestic violence.
In Australia where it has been identified that as many as 75% of all victims of
domestic violence are children Domestic violence services such as Sunnykids are
beginning to focus their attention on children who have been exposed to
domestic violence. Responses that focus on children suggest that experiences
throughout life influence an individuals' propensity to engage in family
violence (either as a victim or as a perpetrator). Researchers supporting this
theory suggest it is useful to think of three sources of domestic violence:
childhood socialization, previous experiences in couple relationships during
adolescence, and levels of strain in a person's current life. People who
observe their parents abusing each other, or who were themselves abused may
incorporate abuse into their behaviour within relationships that they establish
as adults. (Kalmuss & Seltzer 1984) Biological. These factors include genetics
and brain dysfunction and are studied by neuroscience. Psychological.
Psychological theories focus on personality traits and mental characteristics
of the offender. Personality traits include sudden bursts of anger, poor
impulse control, and poor self-esteem. Various theories suggest that
psychopathology and other personality disorders are factors, and that abuse
experienced as a child leads some people to be more violent as adults.
Correlation has been found between juvenile delinquency and domestic violence
in adulthood. Studies have found high incidence of psychopathy among abusers.
For instance, some research suggests that about 80% of both court-referred and
self-referred men in these domestic violence studies exhibited diagnosable
psychopathology, typically personality disorders. "The estimate of personality
disorders in the general population would be more in the 15â€“20% range [...]
As violence becomes more severe and chronic in the relationship, the likelihood
of psychopathology in these men approaches 100%." Dutton has suggested a
psychological profile of men who abuse their wives, arguing that they have
borderline personalities that are developed early in life. However, these
psychological theories are disputed: Gelles suggests that psychological
theories are limited, and points out that other researchers have found that
only 10% (or less) fit this psychological profile. He argues that social
factors are important, while personality traits, mental illness, or psychopathy
are lesser factors. Mental illness. Many psychiatric disorders are risk factors
for domestic violence, including several personality disorders: all Cluster B
PDs, (especially antisocial), paranoid and passive-aggressive. Bipolar
disorder, schizophrenia, drug abuse, alcoholism and poor impulse control are
also risk factors. It is estimated that at least one-third of all abusers have
some type of mental illness. Marital conflict disorder. The American
Psychiatric Association planning and research committees for the forthcoming
DSM-5 (2013) have canvassed a series of new Relational disorders which include
"Marital Conflict Disorder Without Violence" or "Marital Abuse Disorder
(Marital Conflict Disorder With Violence)". Couples with marital disorders
sometimes come to clinical attention because the couple recognize long-standing
dissatisfaction with their marriage and come to the clinician on their own
initiative or are referred by an astute health care professional. Secondly,
there is serious violence in the marriage which is -"usually the husband
battering the wife". In these cases the emergency room or a legal authority
often is the first to notify the clinician. Most importantly, marital violence
"is a major risk factor for serious injury and even death and women in violent
marriages are at much greater risk of being seriously injured or killed
(National Advisory Council on Violence Against Women 2000)." The authors of
this study add that "There is current considerable controversy over whether
male-to-female marital violence is best regarded as a reflection of male
psychopathology and control or whether there is an empirical base and clinical
utility for conceptualizing these patterns as relational." Recommendations for
clinicians making a diagnosis of "Marital Relational Disorder" should include
the assessment of actual or "potential" male violence as regularly as they
assess the potential for suicide in depressed patients. Further, "clinicians
should not relax their vigilance after a battered wife leaves her husband,
because some data suggest that the period immediately following a marital
separation is the period of greatest risk for the women. Many men will stalk
and batter their wives in an effort to get them to return or punish them for
leaving. Initial assessments of the potential for violence in a marriage can be
supplemented by standardized interviews and questionnaires, which have been
reliable and valid aids in exploring marital violence more systematically." The
authors conclude with what they call "very recent information" on the course of
violent marriages which suggests that "over time a husband's battering may
abate somewhat, but perhaps because he has successfully intimidated his wife.
The risk of violence remains strong in a marriage in which it has been a
feature in the past. Thus, treatment is essential here; the clinician cannot
just wait and watch." The most urgent clinical priority is the protection of
the wife because she is the one most frequently at risk, and clinicians must be
aware that supporting assertiveness by a battered wife may lead to more
beatings or even death. Jealousy. Many cases of domestic violence against women
occur due to jealousy when one partner is either suspected of being unfaithful
or is planning to leave the relationship. An evolutionary psychology
explanation of such cases of domestic violence against a woman is that they
represent male attempts to control female reproduction and ensure sexual
exclusivity through violence or the threat of violence. Behavioral. Behavioral
theories draw on the work of behavior analysts. Applied behavior analysis uses
the basic principles of learning theory to change behavior. Behavioral theories
of domestic violence focus on the use of functional assessment with the goal of
reducing episodes of violence to zero rates. This program leads to behavior
therapy. Often by identifying the antecedents and consequences of violent
action, the abusers can be taught self control. Recently more focus has been
placed on prevention and a behavioral prevention theory. Social theories. Looks
at external factors in the offender's environment, such as family structure,
stress, social learning, and includes rational choice theories. Resource
theory. Resource theory was suggested by William Goode (1971). Women who are
most dependent on the spouse for economic well being (e.g. homemakers/
housewives, women with handicaps, the unemployed), and are the primary
caregiver to their children, fear the increased financial burden if they leave
their marriage. Dependency means that they have fewer options and few resources
to help them cope with or change their spouse's behavior. Couples that share
power equally experience lower incidence of conflict, and when conflict does
arise, are less likely to resort to violence. If one spouse desires control and
power in the relationship, the spouse may resort to abuse. This may include
coercion and threats, intimidation, emotional abuse, economic abuse, isolation,
making light of the situation and blaming the spouse, using children
(threatening to take them away), and behaving as "master of the castle". Social
stress. Stress may be increased when a person is living in a family situation,
with increased pressures. Social stresses, due to inadequate finances or other
such problems in a family may further increase tensions. Violence is not always
caused by stress, but may be one way that some people respond to stress.
Families and couples in poverty may be more likely to experience domestic
violence, due to increased stress and conflicts about finances and other
aspects. Some speculate that poverty may hinder a man's ability to live up to
his idea of "successful manhood", thus he fears losing honor and respect.
Theory suggests that when he is unable to economically support his wife, and
maintain control, he may turn to misogyny, substance abuse, and crime as ways
to express masculinity. Social learning theory. Social learning theory suggests
that people learn from observing and modeling after others' behavior. With
positive reinforcement, the behavior continues. If one observes violent
behavior, one is more likely to imitate it. If there are no negative
consequences (e. g. victim accepts the violence, with submission), then the
behavior will likely continue. Often, violence is transmitted from generation
to generation in a cyclical manner. Power and control. In abusive
relationships, violence is posited to arise out of a need for power and control
of one partner over the other. An abuser will use various tactics of abuse
(e.g., physical, verbal, emotional, sexual or financial) in order to establish
and maintain control over the partner. Abusers' efforts to dominate their
partners have been attributed to low self-esteem or feelings of inadequacy,
unresolved childhood conflicts, the stress of poverty, hostility and resentment
toward women (misogyny), hostility and resentment toward men (misandry),
personality disorders, genetic tendencies and sociocultural influences, among
other possible causative factors. Most authorities seem to agree that abusive
personalities result from a combination of several factors, to varying degrees.
A causalist view of domestic violence is that it is a strategy to gain or
maintain power and control over the victim. This view is in alignment with
Bancroft's "cost-benefit" theory that abuse rewards the perpetrator in ways
other than, or in addition to, simply exercising power over his or her target
(s). He cites evidence in support of his argument that, in most cases, abusers
are quite capable of exercising control over themselves, but choose not to do
so for various reasons. An alternative view is that abuse arises from
powerlessness and externalizing/projecting this and attempting to exercise
control of the victim. It is an attempt to 'gain or maintain power and control
over the victim' but even in achieving this it cannot resolve the powerlessness
driving it. Such behaviours have addictive aspects leading to a cycle of abuse
or violence. Mutual cycles develop when each party attempts to resolve their
own powerlessness in attempting to assert control. Questions of power and
control are integral to the widely utilized Duluth Domestic Abuse Intervention
Project. They developed a "Power and Control Wheel" to illustrate this: it has
power and control at the center, surrounded by spokes (techniques used), the
titles of which include: coercion and threats, intimidation, emotional abuse,
isolation, minimizing, denying and blaming, using children, economic abuse, and
male privilege. The model attempts to address abuse by challenging the misuse
of power by the perpetrator. The power wheel model is not intended to assign
personal responsibility, enhance respect for mutual purpose or assist victims
and perpetrators in resolving their differences. Rather, it is an informational
tool designed to help individuals understand the dynamics of power operating in
abusive situations and identify various methods of abuse. Critics of this model
argue that it ignores research linking domestic violence to substance abuse and
psychological problems. Some modern research into the patterns in DV has found
that women are more likely to be physically abusive towards their partner in
relationships in which only one partner is violent, which draws the
effectiveness of using concepts like male privilege to treat domestic violence
into question; however, it may still be valid in studying severe abuse cases,
which are mostly male perpetrated. However, modern research into predictors of
injury from domestic violence finds that the strongest predictor of injury by
domestic violence is participation in reciprocal domestic violence, and that
this pattern of domestic violence is more often initiated by the female in the
relationship. Gender aspects of abuse. The relationship between gender and
domestic violence is a controversial topic. There continues to be debate about
the rates at which each gender is subjected to domestic violence and whether
abused men should be provided the same resources and shelters that exist for
female victims. In particular, some studies suggest that men are less likely to
report being victims of domestic violence due to social stigmas. Other sources,
however, argue that the rate of domestic violence against men is often inflated
due to the practice of including self-defense as a form of domestic violence.
Both men and women have been arrested and convicted of assaulting their
partners in both heterosexual and homosexual relationships. The majority of
these arrests have been men being arrested for assaulting women, though since
the early-to-mid 1990s the number of women arrested has increased
significantly, which is often attributed to the implementation of "Must Arrest"
laws. However, the gender neutrality of the enforcement of domestic violence
laws remains questionable. According to a 2004 survey in Canada, the
percentages of males being physically or sexually victimized by their partners
was 6% versus 7% for women. However, females reported higher levels of repeated
violence and were more likely than men to experience serious injuries; 23% of
females versus 15% of males were faced with the most serious forms of violence
including being beaten, choked, or threatened with or having a gun or knife
used against them. Also, 21% of women versus 11% of men were likely to report
experiencing more than 10 violent incidents. Women who often experience higher
levels of physical or sexual violence from their current partner, were 44%
versus only 18% of males to suffer from an injury. Cases in which women are
faced with extremely abusive partners, results in the females having to fear
for their lives due to the violence they had faced. In addition, statistics
show that 34% of women feared for their lives whereas only 10% of males felt
this way. A problem in conducting studies that seek to describe violence in
terms of gender is the amount of silence, fear and shame that results from
abuse within families and relationships. Another is that abusive patterns can
tend to seem normal to those who have lived in them for a length of time.
Similarly, subtle forms of abuse can be quite transparent even as they set the
stage for further abuse seeming normal. Finally, inconsistent definition of
what constitutes domestic violence makes definite conclusions difficult to
reach when compiling the available studies. Violence against women. Although
the exact rates are widely disputed, especially within the United States, there
is a large body of cross-cultural evidence that women are subjected to domestic
violence significantly more often than men. In addition, there is broad
consensus that women are more often subjected to severe forms of abuse and are
more likely to be injured by an abusive partner. According to a report by the
United States Department of Justice, a survey of 16,000 Americans showed 22.1%
of women and 7.4% of men reported being physically assaulted by a current or
former spouse, cohabiting partner, boyfriend or girlfriend, or date in their
lifetime. A 2010 survey of over 21,000 residents of England and Wales by the UK
Home Office showed that 7% of women and 3% of men were victims of domestic
abuse in the last year. A study in the United States found that women were 13
times more likely than men to seek medical attention due to injuries related to
spousal abuse. Women are more likely than men to be murdered by an intimate
partner. Of those killed by an intimate partner about three quarters are female
and about a quarter are male. In 1999 in the United States 1,218 women and 424
men were killed by an intimate partner, and 1181 females and 329 males were
killed by their intimate partners in 2005. In England and Wales about 100 women
are killed by partners or former partners each year while 21 men were killed in
2010. In 2008, in France, 156 women and 27 men were killed by their intimate
partner. The UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women (1993)
states that "violence against women is a manifestation of historically unequal
power relations between men and women, which has led to domination over and
discrimination against women by men and to the prevention of the full
advancement of women, and that violence against women is one of the crucial
social mechanisms by which women are forced into a subordinate position
compared with men." In their study of severely violent couples, Neil Jacobson
and John Gottman conclude that the "frequency" of violent acts is not as
crucial as the impact of the violence and its function, when trying to
understand spousal abuse; specifically, they state that the purpose of domestic
violence is typically to control and intimidate, rather than just to injure.
Violence against men. Determining how many instances of domestic violence
actually involve male victims is difficult. Male domestic violence victims may
be reluctant to get help for a number of reasons. Some studies have shown that
women who assaulted their male partners were more likely to avoid arrest even
when the male victim contacts police. Another study examined the differences in
how male and female batterers were treated by the criminal justice system. The
study concluded that female intimate violence perpetrators are frequently
viewed by law enforcement and the criminal justice system as victims rather
than the actual offenders of violence against men. Other studies have also
demonstrated a high degree of acceptance of aggression against men by women. A
32-nation study revealed that more than 51% of men and 52% of women felt that
there were times when it was appropriate for a wife to slap her husband. By
comparison, only 26% of men and 21% of women felt that there were times when it
was appropriate for a husband to slap his wife. Studies have shown many police
officers do not treat domestic violence against men as a serious crime, and
often will view the male victim as a "pathetic figure". It is for this reason,
and also the view among many law enforcement officers that men are inherently
"stronger" than women, that male victims are often less likely to report
domestic violence than female victims. When and if they do, men are often
treated as the aggressor in the situation, and often even placed under arrest.
Some researchers have found a relationship between the availability of domestic
violence services, improved laws and enforcement regarding domestic violence,
increased access to divorce, and higher earnings for women with declines in
intimate partner homicide by women. Theories that women are as violent as men
have been dubbed "gender symmetry" theories. Straus and Gelles found that in
couples reporting spousal violence, 27% of the time the man struck the first
blow; in 24% of cases, the woman initiated the violence. The rest of the time,
the violence was mutual, with both partners brawling. The results were the same
even when the most severe episodes of violence were analyzed. In order to
counteract claims that the reporting data was skewed, female-only surveys were
conducted, asking females to self-report, and the data was the same. The simple
tally of physical acts is typically found to be similar in those studies that
examine both directions, but some studies show that male violence may be more
serious. Male violence may do more damage than female violence; women are more
likely to be injured and/or hospitalized. Wives are more likely to be killed by
their husbands than the reverse (59% to 41% per Department of Justice study),
and women in general are more likely to be killed by their spouses than by all
other types of assailants combined. From a data set of 6,200 cases of spousal
abuse in the Detroit area of USA in 1978-79 found that men used weapons 25% of
the time while female assailants used weapons 86% of the time, 74% of men
sustained injury and of these 84% required medical care. Martin S. Fiebert of
the Department of Psychology at California State University, Long Beach, has
compiled an annotated bibliography of research relating to spousal abuse by
women on men. This bibliography examines 275 scholarly investigations: 214
empirical studies and 61 reviews and/or analyses that appear to demonstrate
that women are as physically aggressive, or more aggressive, than men in their
relationships with their spouses or male partners. The aggregate sample size in
the reviewed studies exceeds 365,000. In a "Los Angeles Times" article about
male victims of domestic violence, Fiebert suggests that "...consensus in the
field is that women are as likely as men to strike their partner but thatâ€”as
expectedâ€”women are more likely to be injured than men." However, he noted,
men are seriously injured in 38% of the cases in which "extreme aggression" is
used. Fiebert additionally noted that his work was not meant to minimize the
serious effects of men who abuse women. In a review of the research however
Michael Kimmel found that violence is instrumental in maintaining control and
that more than 90% of "systematic, persistent, and injurious" violence is
perpetrated by men. He points out that most of the empirical studies that
Fiebert reviewed used the same empirical measure of family conflict, i.e., the
Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS) as the sole measure of domestic violence and that
many of the studies noted by Fiebert discussed samples composed entirely of
single people younger than 30, not married couples. Kimmel argues that among
various other flaws, the CTS is particularly vulnerable to reporting bias
because it depends on asking people to accurately remember and report what
happened during the past year. Men tend to underestimate their use of violence,
while women tend to overestimate their use of violence. Simultaneously men tend
to overestimate their partner's use of violence while women tend to
underestimate their partner's use of violence. Thus, men will likely
overestimate their victimization, while women tend to underestimate theirs.
Similarly, the National Institute of Justice states that some studies finding
equal or greater frequency of abuse by women against men are based on data
compiled through the Conflict Tactics Scale. This survey tool was developed in
the 1970s and may not be appropriate for intimate partner violence research
because it does not measure control, coercion, or the motives for conflict
tactics; it also leaves out sexual assault and violence by ex-spouses or
partners and does not determine who initiated the violence. Furthermore, the
NIJ contends that national surveys supported by NIJ, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, and the Bureau of Justice Statistics that examine more
serious assaults do not support the conclusion of similar rates of male and
female spousal assaults. These surveys are conducted within a safety or crime
context and clearly find more partner abuse by men against women. However more
modern Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other research reports
that female perpetrated domestic abuse, is more common than male The present
analyses indicate that men are among those who are likely to be on the
receiving end of acts of physical aggression. The extent to which this involves
mutual combat or the male equivalent to "battered women" is at present
unresolved. Both situations are causes for concern. Straus (1997) has warned of
the dangers involvedâ€”especially for womenâ€”when physical aggression becomes
a routine response to relationship conflict. "Battered men"â€”those subjected
to systematic and prolonged violenceâ€”are likely to suffer physical and
psychological consequences, together with specific problems associated with a
lack of recognition of their plight (George and George, 1998). Seeking to
address these problems need not detract from continuing to address the problem
of "battered women." Gender roles and expectations can and do play a role in
abusive situations, and exploring these roles and expectations can be helpful
in addressing abusive situations. Likewise, it can be helpful to explore
factors such as race, class, religion, sexuality and philosophy. However,
studies investigating whether sexist attitudes are correlated with domestic
violence have shown conflicting results. A 1997 report says significantly more
men than women do not disclose the identity of their attacker. A 2009 study
showed that there was greater acceptance for abuse perpetrated by females than
by males. Several studies have confirmed that womenâ€™s physical violence
towards intimate male partners is sometimes in self-defense. In Norway,
researcher Anja Bredal's opinion is that non-Norwegian men are being assaulted
by their wives who are of the same ethnicityâ€”who are Norwegian citizens.
Same-sex relationships. Domestic violence also occurs in same-sex
relationships. Gay and lesbian relationships have been identified as a risk
factor for abuse in certain populations. In an effort to be more inclusive,
many organizations have made an effort to use gender-neutral terms when
referring to perpetratorship and victimhood. Historically, domestic violence
has been seen as a family issue and little interest has been directed at
violence in same-sex relationships. It has not been until recently, as the gay
rights movement has brought the issues of gay and lesbian people into public
attention, when research has been conducted on same-sex relationships. A 1999
analysis of nineteen studies of partner abuse concluded that "esearch suggests
that lesbians and gay men are just as likely to abuse their partners as
heterosexual men," although the study also noted the uncertain nature of much
of the contemporary research in the area. Gays and lesbians, however, face
special obstacles in dealing with the issues that some researchers have labeled
"the double closet". A recent Canadian study by Mark W. Lehman suggests
similarities include frequency (approximately one in every four couples);
manifestations (emotional, physical, financial, etc.); co-existent situations
(unemployment, substance abuse, low self-esteem); victims' reactions (fear,
feelings of helplessness, hypervigilance); and reasons for staying (love, can
work it out, things will change, denial). At the same time, significant
differences, unique issues and deceptive myths are typically present. Lehman
points to added discrimination and fear gays and lesbians can face. This
includes potential dismissal by police and some social services, a lack of
support from peers who would rather keep quiet about the problem in order not
to attract negative attention toward the gay community, the impacts of HIV
status or AIDS in keeping partners together, due to health care insurance/
access, or guilt; outing used as a weapon, and encountering supportive services
that are targeted and/or structured for the needs of heterosexual women and
which may not meet the needs of gay men or lesbians. However Lehman himself
noted that "due to the limited number of returned responses and non-random
sampling methodology the findings of this work are not generalizable beyond the
sample" of 32 initial respondents and final 10 who completed the more in-depth
survey. Cycle of abuse. Frequently, domestic violence is used to describe
specific violent and overtly abusive incidents, and legal definitions will tend
to take this perspective. However, when violent and abusive behaviours happen
within a relationship, the effects of those behaviours continue after these
overt incidents are over. Advocates and counsellors will refer to domestic
violence as a pattern of behaviours, including those listed above. Although it
is easy to see the outbursts of the Acting-out Phase as abuse, even the more
pleasant behaviours of the Honeymoon Phase serve to perpetuate the abuse. Many
domestic violence advocates believe that the cycle of abuse theory is limited
and does not reflect the realities of many men and women experiencing domestic
violence. Management. The response to domestic violence is typically a combined
effort between law enforcement, social services, and health care. The role of
each has evolved as domestic violence has been brought more into public view.
Domestic violence historically has been viewed as a private family matter that
need not involve the government or criminal justice. Police officers were often
reluctant to intervene by making an arrest, and often chose instead to simply
counsel the couple and/or ask one of the parties to leave the residence for a
period of time. The courts were reluctant to impose any significant sanctions
on those convicted of domestic violence, largely because it was viewed as a
misdemeanor offense. Today domestic violence should be viewed as a public
matter. All criminal authority should be involved. Now the offender is killing
innocent people. Once the violence is reported it should be taken seriously.
Domestic violence is never a private family matter any longer. Domestic
violence should be viewed as criminal not viewed as a misdemeanor offense.
Medical response. Medical professionals can make a difference in the lives of
those who experience abuse. Many cases of spousal abuse are handled solely by
physicians and do not involve the police. Sometimes cases of domestic violence
are brought into the emergency room, while many other cases are handled by
family physician or other primary care provider. Subspecialist physicians are
also increasingly playing an important role. For example, HIV physicians are
ideally suited to play an important role in managing abuse given the
association between abuse and HIV infection as well as their often lifelong
relationships with patients. Medical professionals are in position to empower
people, give advice, and refer them to appropriate services. The health care
professional has not always met this role, with uneven quality of care, and in
some cases misunderstandings about domestic violence. Washaw (1993) suggests
that many doctors prefer not to get involved in people's "private" lives.
Clifton, Jacobs, and Tulloch (1996) found that training for general
practitioners in the United States about domestic violence was very limited or
they had no training. Abbott and Williamson found that knowledge and
understanding of domestic violence was very limited among health care
professionals in a Midlands, United Kingdom county, and that they do not see
themselves as being able to play a major role in helping women in regards to
domestic violence. Furthermore, in the biomedical model of health care,
injuries are often just treated and diagnosed, without regard for the causes.
As well, there is substantial reluctance for victims to come forward and broach
the issue with their physicians. On average, women experience 35 incidents of
domestic violence before seeking treatment. In the U. S., the Institute of
Medicine recognized the shortcomings of the health care system in its 2002
report entitled Confronting Chronic Neglect and attributed some of the problems
cited to a lack of adequate training among health professionals. Health
professionals have an ethical responsibility to recognize and address exposure
to abuse in their patients, in the health care setting. For example, the
American Medical Association's code of medical ethics states that "Due to the
prevalence and medical consequences of family violence, physicians should
routinely inquire about physical, sexual, and psychological abuse as part of
the medical history. Physicians must also consider abuse in the differential
diagnosis for a number of medical complaints, particularly when treating
women." Duluth model. In 1981, the Duluth Domestic Abuse Intervention Project
became the first multi-disciplinary program designed to address the issue of
domestic violence. This experiment, conducted in Duluth, Minnesota, frequently
referred to as the "Duluth Project" because it is constantly evolving through
the help of an entire community. It coordinated agencies dealing with domestic
situations, drawing together diverse elements of the system, from police
officers on the street, to shelters for battered women and probation officers
supervising offenders. This program has become a model for other jurisdictions
seeking to deal more effectively with domestic violence. Corrections/probation
agencies in many areas are supervising domestic violence offenders more
closely, and are also paying closer attention to the victim's needs and safety
issues. There has been controversy as the Duluth framework depends on a strict
"patriarchal violence" model and presumes that all violence in the home and
elsewhere has a male perpetrator and female victim. Also evidence of success of
the model is limited, with scholarly analysis and critique. Many victims leave
their abusers, only to return. Research has shown that a major factor in
helping a victim to establish lasting independence from the abusive partner is
her or his ability to get legal assistance. Economists at the Brennan Center
for Justice analyzed Bureau of Justice Statistics data to determine what
accounted for the nationwide reduction in reported abuse. Their findings
revealed that one significant factor was the availability of legal services to
assist abuse victims. Another major study by economists at Colgate University
and the University of Arkansas flatly stated that the only public service that
reduces domestic violence in the long term is legal aid. Legal assistance can
provide essential safety planning, buttress a familyâ€™s economic position
through child or spousal support, allay fears planted by the batterer about
loss of custody, and help victims to secure needed government benefits. The
Domestic Abuse Intervention Program has federal, state and local funders who
support them. This funding allows DAIP to explore strategies to end violence to
communities throughout the United States and around the world. Law enforcement.
In the 1970s, it was widely believed that domestic disturbance calls were the
most dangerous type for responding officers, who arrive to a highly emotionally
charged situation. This belief was based on FBI statistics which turned out to
be flawed, in that they grouped all types of disturbances together with
domestic disturbances, such as brawls at a bar. Subsequent statistics and
analysis have shown this belief to be false. Statistics on incidents of
domestic violence, published in the late 1970s, helped raise public awareness
of the problem and increase activism. A study published in 1976 by the Police
Foundation found that the police had intervened at least once in the previous
two years in 85% of spouse homicides. In the late 1970s and early 1980s,
feminists and battered women's advocacy groups were calling on police to take
domestic violence more seriously and change intervention strategies. In some
instances, these groups took legal action against police departments, including
Los Angeles's, Oakland, California's and New York City's, to get them to make
arrests in domestic violence cases. They claimed that police assigned low
priority to domestic disturbance calls. The Minneapolis Domestic Violence
Experiment was a study done in 1981â€“1982, led by Lawrence W. Sherman, to
evaluate the effectiveness of various police responses to domestic violence
calls in Minneapolis, Minnesota, including sending the abuser away for eight
hours, giving advice and mediation for disputes, and making an arrest. Arrest
was found to be the most effective police response. The study found that arrest
reduced the rate by half of re-offending against the same victim within the
following six months. The results of the study received a great deal of
attention from the news media, including "The New York Times" and prime-time
news coverage on television. Many U.S. police departments responded to the
study, adopting a mandatory arrest policy for spousal violence cases with
probable cause. By 2005, 23 states and the District of Columbia had enacted
mandatory arrest for domestic assault, without warrant, given that the officer
has probable cause and regardless of whether or not the officer witnessed the
crime. The Minneapolis study also influenced policy in other countries,
including New Zealand, which adopted a pro-arrest policy for domestic violence
cases. However, the study was subject of much criticism, with concerns about
its methodology, as well as its conclusions. The Minneapolis study was
replicated in several other cities, beginning in 1986, with some of these
studies having different results; one of which being the fact that the
deterrent effect observed in the Minneapolis experiment was largely localized.
In the replication studies which were far more broad and methodologically sound
in both size and scope, arrest seemed to help in the short run in certain
cases, but those arrested experienced double the rate of violence over the
course of one year. Criminologists do not fully understand the reasons why
deterrent effects do not last over time. But they suggest that abusers who are
employed and have ties to the community may initially fear punishment, though
many cases do not make it all the way through the criminal justice process. If
the victim is uncooperative during investigation, the prosecutor may choose not
to pursue the case. If the case is pursued through the criminal justice system,
sometimes the resulting sentence is minor. Subsequently, any fear that the
abuser has of punishment may have diminished. Along with protecting the victim,
law enforcement officers have to ensure that the alleged abusers' rights are
not violated. Many times in cases of mutual combatants, it is departmental
policy that both parties be arrested and the court system can establish truth
at a later date. In some areas of the nation, this mutual combatant philosophy
is being replaced by the primary abuser philosophy in which case if both
parties have physical injuries, the law enforcement officer determines who the
primary aggressor is and only arrests that one. This philosophy started gaining
momentum when different government/private agencies started researching the
effects. It was found that when both parties are arrested, it had an adverse
effect on the victim. The victims were less likely to call or trust law
enforcement during the next incident of domestic abuse. In Spain, the 2004 "The
Organic Act on Integrated Protection Measures against Gender Violence"
established Courts of "Violence against Women." Spanish Courts may allow to
hear the case behind closed doors and that proceedings should not be made
public, order a person accused of gender violence to leave the abode he shared
with his victim, suspend the alleged perpetrator of acts of gender violence
from exercising parental authority, custody or guardianship with regard to the
minors he or she specifies, and may order the suspension of the right to
possess weapons. It was announced on April 13, 2011 that all homicides
resulting from domestic abuse in England and Wales will be subject to a multi-
agency review involving the police and health services, local authorities,
probation, voluntary groups and any other bodies connected to a victim.
Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer pointed out that the survey shows
young women between the ages of sixteen and nineteen at highest risk of
domestic abuse, saying "What that tends to show is that there may be a next
generation of domestic violence waiting in the wings. Domestic violence is
serious and pernicious. It ruins lives, breaks up families and has a lasting
impact." In England and Wales there is no specific offence of domestic violence
and incidents are prosecuted under generally applicable legislation. However,
when an offence is committed in a domestic context, specific aggravating
factors commonly arise. Counseling for person affected. Due to the extent and
prevalence of violence in relationships, counselors and therapists should
assess every client for domestic violence (both experienced and perpetrated).
If the clinician is seeing a couple for coupleâ€™s counseling, this assessment
should be conducted with each individual privately during the initial
interview, in order to increase the victimâ€™s sense of safety in disclosing DV
in the relationship. In addition to determining whether DV is present,
counselors and therapists should also make the distinction between situations
where battering may have been a single, isolated incident or an ongoing pattern
of control. The therapist must, however, consider that domestic violence may be
present even when there has been only a single physical incident as emotional/
verbal, economic, and sexual abuse may be more insidious. Another important
issue in assessing clients for DV lies in differing definitions of abuseÂ â€“
the therapistâ€™s definition may differ from that of the client, and paying
close attention to the way the client describes their experiences is crucial in
developing effective treatment plans. The therapist must determine if it is in
the best interest of the client to explain that some behaviors (such as
emotional abuse) are considered domestic violence, even if the client did not
previously consider them as such. If it becomes apparent to the therapist that
domestic violence is taking place in a clientâ€™s relationship, there are
several statements the clinician can make that have been shown to be effective
in rapport-building and immediate crisis intervention with clients. Firstly, it
is essential that the therapist believe the victimâ€™s story and validate their
feelings. It is recommended that the therapist acknowledge them for taking a
risk in disclosing this information, and assure them that any ambivalent
feelings they may be having are normal. The therapist should emphasize that the
abuse they have experienced is not their fault, but should keep their feelings
of ambivalence in mind and refrain from blaming their partner or telling them
what to do. It is unreasonable for the therapist to expect that a victim will
leave their perpetrator solely because they disclosed the abuse, and the
therapist should respect the victimâ€™s autonomy and allow them to make their
own decisions regarding termination of the relationship. Finally, the therapist
must explore options with the client (such as emergency housing in shelters,
police involvement, etc.) in order to uphold their obligation to protect the
welfare of the client. Lethality assessment. A lethality assessment is a tool
that can assist in determining the best course of treatment for a client, as
well as helping the client to recognize dangerous behaviors and more subtle
abuse in their relationship. In a study of victims of attempted domestic
violence-related homicide, only about one-half of the participants recognized
that their perpetrator was capable of killing them, as many domestic violence
victims minimize the true seriousness of their situation. Thus, lethality
assessment is an essential first step in assessing the severity of a victimâ€™s
situation. Safety planning. Safety planning allows the victim to plan for
dangerous situations they may encounter, and is effective regardless of their
decision on whether remain with their perpetrator. Safety planning usually
begins with determining a course of action if another acute incident occurs in
the home. The victim should be given strategies for their own safety, such as
avoiding confrontations in rooms where there is only one exit and avoiding
certain rooms that contain many potential weapons (such as kitchens, bathrooms,
etc.). Counseling for offenders. The main goal for treatment for offenders of
domestic violence is to minimize the offenderâ€™s risk of future domestic
violence, whether within the same relationship or a new one. Treatment for
offenders should emphasize minimizing risk to the victim, and should be
modified depending on the offenderâ€™s history, risk of reoffending, and
criminogenic needs. The majority of offender treatment programs are 24â€“36
weeks in length and are conducted in a group setting with groups not exceeding
12 participants. Groups are also standardized to be gender specific (male
offenders only or female offenders only). It has been demonstrated that
domestic violence offenders maintain a socially acceptable faÃ§ade to hide
abusive behavior, and therefore accountability is the recommended focus of
offender treatment programs. Successful completion of treatment is generally
associated with old age, higher levels of education, lower reported drug use,
non-violent criminal histories, and longer intimate relationships. Anger
management alone has not been shown to be effective in treating domestic
violence offenders, as domestic violence is based on power and control and not
on problems with regulating anger responses. Anger management is recommended as
a part of an offender treatment curriculum that is based on accountability,
along with topics such as recognizing abusive patterns of behavior and re-
framing communication skills. Treatment of offenders involves more than the
cessation of abusive behaviour; it also requires a great deal of personal
change and the construction of a self-image that is separate from former
behaviour while still being held accountable for it. Any corresponding problems
should also be addressed as part of domestic violence offender treatment, such
as problems with substance abuse or other mental illness. Prevention and
intervention. There are many community organizations which work to prevent
domestic violence by offering safe shelter, crisis intervention, advocacy, and
education and prevention programs. Community screening for domestic violence
can be more systematic in cases of animal abuse, healthcare settings, emergency
departments, behavioral health settings and court systems. Tools are being
developed to facilitate domestic violence screening such as mobile apps.
Pregnancy. Pregnancy, when coupled with Domestic violence, may amplify health
risks. Abuse during pregnancy, whether physical, verbal or emotional, produces
adverse effects for both the mother and fetus. Domestic violence during
pregnancy is categorized as abusive behavior towards a pregnant woman, where
the pattern of abuse can often change in terms of severity and frequency of
violence. Abuse may be a long-standing problem in a relationship that continues
after a woman becomes pregnant or it may commence in pregnancy. Although
female-to-male partner violence occurs in these settings, the overwhelming form
of domestic violence is perpetrated by men against women. Domestic abuse can be
triggered by pregnancy for a number of reasons. Pregnancy itself can be used a
form of coercion and the phenomenon of preventing an intimate partnerâ€™s
reproductive choice is referred to as birth control sabotage, or reproductive
coercion. Studies on the birth control sabotage performed by males against
female partners have indicated a strong correlation between domestic violence
and birth control sabotage. Pregnancy can also lead to a hiatus of domestic
violence when the abuser does not want to harm the unborn child. The risk of
domestic violence for pregnant women is greatest immediately after childbirth.
In 2010, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 4.8% of
women reported having had an intimate partner who tried to get them pregnant
when they did not want to while 8.7% of men reported having had an intimate
partner who tried to get pregnant when they did not want to or tried to stop
them from using birth control. Prognosis. New research illustrates that there
are strong associations between exposure to domestic violence and abuse in all
their forms and higher rates of many chronic conditions. The strongest evidence
comes from the Adverse Childhood Experiences' series of studies which show
correlations between exposure to abuse or neglect and higher rates in adulthood
of chronic conditions, high risk health behaviors and shortened life span.
Evidence of the association between physical health and violence against women
has been accumulating since the early 1990s. Studies have indicated that it is
important to consider the effect of domestic violence and its psychophysiologic
sequelae on women who are mothers of infants and young children. Several
studies have shown that maternal interpersonal violence-related posttraumatic
stress disorder (PTSD) can, despite traumatized mother's best efforts,
interfere with their child's response to the domestic violence and other
traumatic events. Thus, practitioners and service agencies addressing the needs
of domestic violence victims should assess the victim-as-parent and evaluate
the safety and well-being of children in the home. More recently work by such
researchers as Corso have begun to quantify the economic impact of exposure to
violence and abuse. A recent publication, "Hidden Costs in Health Care: The
Economic Impact of Violence and Abuse, " makes the case that such exposure
represents a serious and costly public health issue that should be addressed by
the health care system. Epidemiology. Domestic violence occurs across the
world, in various cultures, and affects people of all economic statuses.
According to one study, the percentage of women who have reported being
physically abused by an intimate partner vary from 69% to 10% depending on the
country. In the United States, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics in
1995 women reported a six times greater rate of intimate partner violence than
men. The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) indicates that in 1998
about 876,340 violent crimes were committed in the U.S. against women by their
current or former spouses, or boyfriends. According to the Centers for Disease
Control, in the United States 4.8 million women suffer intimate partner related
physical assaults and rapes and 2.9 million men are victims of physical assault
from their partners. Studies have found that men are much less likely to report
victimization in these situations. According to some studies, less than 1% of
domestic violence cases are reported to the police. In the United States
10â€“35% of the population will be physically aggressive towards a partner at
some point in their lives. As abuse becomes more severe women become
increasingly overrepresented as victims. Fighting the prevalence of domestic
violence in Kashmir has brought Hindu and Muslim activists together.
Additionally, aspects of Islamic law have been criticized for promoting
domestic violence One study found that half of Palestinian women have been the
victims of domestic violence. 80% of women surveyed in rural Egypt said that
beatings were common and often justified, particularly if the woman refused to
have sex with her husband. The Human Rights Watch found that up to 90% of women
in Pakistan were subject to some form of maltreatment, within their own homes.
Unofficial statistics estimate that 97% of Indian women experience violence at
some point in their lives. Up to two-thirds of women in certain communities in
Nigeria's Lagos State say they are victims to domestic violence. In Turkey 42%
of women over 15 have suffered physical or sexual violence. Statistics
published in 2004, show that the rate of domestic violence victimisation for
Indigenous women in Australia may be 40 times the rate for non-Indigenous
women. In Canada, the Assembly of First Nations evaluation of the Canada
Prenatal Nutrition Program conducted by CIET offers an inclusive and relatively
unbiased national estimate. It documented domestic violence in a random sample
of 85 First Nations across Canada: 22% (523/2359) of mothers reported suffering
abuse in the year prior to being interviewed; of these, 59% reported physical
abuse. In Turkey 42% of women over 15 have suffered physical or sexual
violence. Results of studies which estimate the prevalence of domestic violence
vary significantly, depending on specific wording of survey questions, how the
survey is conducted, the definition of abuse or domestic violence used, the
willingness or unwillingness of victims to admit that they have been abused and
other factors. For instance, Straus (2005) conducted a study which estimated
that the rate of minor assaults by women in the United States was 78 per 1,000
couples, compared with a rate for men of 72 per 1,000 and the severe assault
rate was 46 per 1,000 couples for assaults by women and 50 per 1,000 for
assaults by men. Neither difference is statistically significant. He claimed
that since these rates were based exclusively on information provided by women
respondents, the near-equality in assault rates could not be attributed to a
gender bias in reporting. One analysis found that "women are as physically
aggressive or more aggressive than men in their relationships with their
spouses or male partners". However, studies have shown that women are more
likely to be injured. Archer's meta-analysis found that women in the United
States suffer 65% of domestic violence injuries. A Canadian study showed that
7% of women and 6% of men were abused by their current or former partners, but
female victims of spousal violence were more than twice as likely to be injured
as male victims, three times more likely to fear for their life, twice as
likely to be stalked, and twice as likely to experience more than ten incidents
of violence. However, Straus notes that Canadian studies on domestic violence
have simply excluded questions that ask men about being victimized by their
wives. Some studies show that lesbian relationships have similar levels of
violence as heterosexual relationships. History. Prior to the mid 1800s, most
legal systems accepted wife beating as a valid exercise of a husband's
authority over his wife. One exception, however, was the 1641 Body of Liberties
of the Massachusetts Bay colonists, which declared that a married woman should
be "free from bodilie correction or stripes by her husband." Political
agitation during the nineteenth century led to changes in both popular opinion
and legislation regarding domestic violence within the United Kingdom and the
United States. In 1850, Tennessee became the first state in the United States
to explicitly outlaw wife beating. Other states soon followed suit. In 1878,
the Matrimonial Causes Act made it possible for women in the UK to seek
separations from abusive husbands. By the end of the 1870s, most courts in the
United States were uniformly opposed to the right of husbands to physically
discipline their wives. By the early twentieth century, it was common for
police to intervene in cases of domestic violence in the United States, but
arrests remained rare. Modern attention to domestic violence began in the
women's movement of the 1970s, particularly within the contexts of feminism and
women's rights, as concern about wives being beaten by their husbands gained
attention. The first known use of the expression "domestic violence" in a
modern context, meaning "spouse abuse, violence in the home" was in an address
to the Parliament of the United Kingdom in 1973. A few months later the world's
first domestic violence services federation (Women's Aid) was set up in 1974,
providing practical and emotional support as part of a range of services to
women and children experiencing violence in England. With the rise of the men's
movement of the 1990s, the problem of domestic violence against men also gained
significant attention.
