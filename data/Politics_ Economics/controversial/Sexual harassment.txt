Sexual harassment Sexual harassment is intimidation, bullying or coercion of a
sexual nature, or the unwelcome or inappropriate promise of rewards in exchange
for sexual favors. In most modern legal contexts, sexual harassment is illegal.
As defined by EEOC, "It is unlawful to harass a person (an applicant or
employee) because of that personâ€™s sex." Harassment can include "sexual
harassment" or unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other
verbal or physical harassment of a sexual nature. Where laws surrounding sexual
harassment exist, they typically donâ€™t prohibit simple teasing, offhand
comments, or minor isolated incidents. In the workplace, harassment may be
considered illegal when it is so frequent or severe that it creates a hostile
or offensive work environment or when it results in an adverse employment
decision (such as the victim being fired or demoted, or when the victim decides
to quit the job). The harasser can be the victim's supervisor, a supervisor in
another area, a co-worker, or someone who is not an employee of the employer,
such as a client or customer. It includes a range of behavior from mild
transgressions to sexual abuse or sexual assault. Sexual harassment is a form
of illegal employment discrimination in many countries, and is a form of abuse
(sexual and psychological) and bullying. For many businesses and other
organizations, preventing sexual harassment, and defending employees from
sexual harassment charges, have become key goals of legal decision-making.
Coining the term and history. The term "sexual harassment" was used in 1973 in
a report to the then President and Chancellor of MIT about various forms of
gender issues. Rowe has stated that she believes she was not the first to use
the term, since sexual harassment was being discussed in women's groups in
Massachusetts in the early 1970s, but that MIT may have been the first or one
of the first large organizations to discuss the topic (in the MIT Academic
Council), and to develop relevant policies and procedures. MIT at the time also
recognized the injuries caused by racial harassment and the harassment of women
of color which may be both racial and sexual. The President of MIT also stated
that harassment (and favoritism) are antithetical to the mission of a
university as well as intolerable for individuals. In the book "In Our Time:
Memoir of a Revolution" (1999), journalist Susan Brownmiller quotes the Cornell
activists who in 1975 thought they had coined the term sexual harassment:
"Eight of us were sitting in an office ... brainstorming about what we were
going to write on posters for our speak-out. We were referring to it as 'sexual
intimidation,' 'sexual coercion,' 'sexual exploitation on the job.' None of
those names seemed quite right. We wanted something that embraced a whole range
of subtle and un-subtle persistent behaviors. Somebody came up with
'harassment.' 'Sexual harassment!' Instantly we agreed. That's what it was."
These activists, Lin Farley, Susan Meyer, and Karen Sauvigne went on to form
Working Women's Institute which, along with the Alliance Against Sexual
Coercion, founded in 1976 by Freada Klein, Lynn Wehrli, and Elizabeth Cohn-
Stuntz, were among the pioneer organizations to bring sexual harassment to
public attention in the late 1970s. Still the term was largely unknown until
the early 1990s when Anita Hill witnessed and testified against Supreme Court
nominee Clarence Thomas. Since Hill testified in 1991, the number of sexual
harassment cases reported in US and Canada increased 58 percent and have
climbed steadily ever since. Varied behaviors. One of the difficulties in
understanding sexual harassment is that it involves a range of behaviors. In
most cases (although not in all cases) is difficult for the victim to describe
what they experienced. This can be related to difficulty classifying the
situation or could be related to stress and humiliation experienced by the
recipient. Moreover, behavior and motives vary between individual cases.
Behavioral classes. Langelan describes three different classes of harassers.
Prevention. Sexual harassment and assault may be prevented by secondary school,
college, and workplace education programs. At least one program for fraternity
men produced "sustained behavioral change." The injured of sexual harassment.
Effects of sexual harassment can vary depending on the individuality of the
recipient and the severity and duration of the harassment. Often, sexual
harassment incidents fall into the category of the "merely annoying." In other
situations harassment may lead to temporary or prolonged stress and/or
depression depending on the recipient's psychological abilities to cope and the
type of harassment, and the social support or lack of it for the recipient.
Psychologists and social workers report that severe/chronic sexual harassment
can have the same psychological effects as rape or sexual assault. Victims who
do not submit to harassment may also experience various forms of retaliation,
including isolation and bullying. As an overall social and economic effect
every year sexual harassment deprive women form active social and economic
participation, and costs hundreds of millions of dollars in lost educational
and professional opportunities for mostly girls and women. However, the
quantity of men implied in these conflicts is significant. Coping. Sexual
harassment, by definition, is unwanted and not to be tolerated but there often
are a number of effective ways for offended and injured people to overwhelm
harassment psychological effects, remain or return socialization, regain
personal relationship feelings when they were affected by the outside
relationship trauma, and regain social approval, return ability to concentrate
and be productive in educational, work, etc. environments. This may include
stress management and therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, friends and family
support, etc. Immediate psychological and legal counseling are suggestive in
the happening of the event since self-treatment may not release stress or
remove trauma, and simply reporting to authorities may not have the desired
effect, be ignored or may further injure the victim at its response, or may
lead to harmful social circumstances in relation to creating difficulties in
school or workplace, and even firing. Common effects on the victims.
depression, anxiety and/or panic attacks, sleeplessness and/or nightmares,
shame and guilt, difficulty concentrating, headaches, fatigue or loss of
motivation, stomach problems, eating disorders (weight loss or gain),
alcoholism, feeling betrayed and/or violated, feeling angry or violent towards
the perpetrator, feeling powerless or out of control, increased blood pressure,
loss of confidence and self-esteem, withdrawal and isolation, overall loss of
trust in people, traumatic stress, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),
complex post-traumatic stress disorder, suicidal thoughts or attempts, suicide.
Retaliation and backlash. Retaliation and backlash against a victim are very
common, particularly a complainant. Victims who speak out against sexual
harassment are often labeled troublemakers who are on their own "power trips,"
or who are looking for attention. Similar to cases of rape or sexual assault,
"the victim" often becomes "the accused", with their appearance, private life,
and character likely to fall under intrusive scrutiny and attack. They risk
hostility and isolation from colleagues, supervisors, teachers, fellow
students, and even friends. They may become the targets of mobbing or
relational aggression. Women are not necessarily sympathetic to female
complainants who have been sexually harassed. If the harasser was male,
internalized sexism, and/or jealousy over the sexual attention towards the
victim, may encourage some women to react with as much hostility towards the
complainant as some male colleagues. Fear of being targeted for harassment or
retaliation themselves may also cause some women to respond with hostility. For
example, when Lois Jenson filed her lawsuit against Eveleth Taconite Co., the
women shunned her both at work and in the communityâ€”many of these women later
joined her suit. Women may even project hostility onto the victim in order to
bond with their male coworkers and build trust. Retaliation has occurred when a
sexual harassment victim suffers a "negative action" as a result of the
harassment. For example, a complainant be given poor evaluations or low grades,
have their projects sabotaged, be denied work or academic opportunities, have
their work hours cut back, and other actions against them which undermine their
productivity, or their ability to advance at work or school, being fired after
reporting sexual harassmentor leading to unemployment as they may be suspended,
asked to resign, or be fired from their jobs altogether. Retaliation can even
involve further sexual harassment, and also stalking and cyberstalking of the
victim. Moreover, a school professor or employer accused of sexual harassment,
or who is the colleague of a perpetrator, can use their power to see that a
victim is never hired again, or never accepted to another school. Of the women
who have approached her to share their own experiences of being sexually
harassed by their teachers, feminist and writer Naomi Wolf writes,  Another
woman who was interviewed by Helen Watson, a sociologist, reported that,
"Facing up to the crime and having to deal with it in public is probably worse
than suffering in silence. I found it to be a lot worse than the harassment
itself." which directs to the nature of reexperiencing of the situation and
baring negativism of group opinion. Organizational policies and procedures.
Most companies have policies against sexual harassment, however these policies
are not designed and should not attempt to "regulate romance" which goes
against human urges. Studies show that organizational climate (an
organizationâ€™s tolerance, policy, procedure etc.) and workplace environment
are essential for understanding the conditions in which sexual harassment is
likely to occur, and the way its victims will be affected (yet, research on
specific policy and procedure, and awareness strategies is lacking). Another
element which increases the risk for sexual harassment is the jobâ€™s gender
context (having few women in the close working environment or practicing in a
field which is atypical for women). According to Dr. Orit Kamir, the most
effective way to avoid sexual harassment in the work place, and also influence
the publicâ€™s state of mind, is for the employer to adopt a clear policy
prohibiting sexual harassment and to make it very clear to their employees.
Many women prefer to make a complaint and to have the matter resolved within
the workplace rather than to "air out the dirty laundry" with a public
complaint and be seen as a traitor by colleagues, superiors and employers, adds
Kamir.Â  â€¢  Most prefer a pragmatic solution that would stop the harassment
and prevent future contact with the harasser rather than turning to the police.
More about the difficulty in turning an offence into a legal act can be found
in Felstiner & Saratâ€™s (1981) study, which describes three steps a victim (of
any dispute) must go through before turning to the justice system: naming â€“
giving the assault a definition, blaming â€“ understanding who is responsible
for the violation of rights and facing them, and finally, claiming â€“ turning
to the authorities. Evolution of sexual harassment law in different
jurisdictions. In India, the case of Vishaka Vs. State of Rajasthan in 1997 has
been credited with establishing sexual harassment as illegal. In Israel, the
1988 Equal Employment Opportunity Law made it a crime for an employer to
retaliate against an employee who had rejected sexual advances, but it wasn't
until 1998 that the Israeli Sexual Harassment Law made such behavior illegal.
In May 2002, the European Union Council and Parliament amended a 1976 Council
Directive on the equal treatment of men and women in employment to prohibit
sexual harassment in the workplace, naming it a form of sex discrimination and
violation of dignity. This Directive required all Member States of the European
Union to adopt laws on sexual harassment, or amend existing laws to comply with
the Directive by October 2005. In 2005, China added new provisions to the "Law
on Women's Right Protection" to include sexual harassment. In 2006 "The
Shanghai Supplement" was drafted to help further define sexual harassment in
China. Varied legal guidelines and definitions. "such unwelcome sexually
determined behavior as physical contact and advances, sexually colored remarks,
showing pornography and sexual demands, whether by words or actions. Such
conduct can be humiliating and may constitute a health and safety problem; it
is discriminatory when the woman has reasonable ground to believe that her
objection would disadvantage her in connection with her employment, including
recruitment or promotion, or when it creates a hostile working environment."
While such conduct can be harassment of women by men, many laws around the
world which prohibit sexual harassment recognize that both men and women may be
harassers or victims of sexual harassment. However, most claims of sexual
harassment are made by women. There are many similarities, and also important
differences in laws and definitions used around the world.and Australia. The
Sex Discrimination Act 1984 defines sexual harassment as "... unwanted conduct
of a sexual nature, in circumstances in which a reasonable person, having
regard to all the circumstances, would have anticipated that the person
harassed would be offended, humiliated or intimidated." Czech Republic.
Undesirable behavior of a sexual nature at the workplace if such conduct is
unwelcome, unsuitable or insulting, or if it can be justifiably perceived by
the party concerned as a condition for decisions affecting the exercise of
rights and obligations ensuring from labor relations. Denmark. Sexual
harassment is defined as, when any verbal, non-verbal or physical action is
used to change a victim's sexual status against the will of the victim and
resulting in the victim feeling inferior or hurting the victim's dignity. Man
and woman are looked upon as equal, and any action trying to change the balance
in status with the differences in sex as a tool, is also sexual harassment. In
the workplace, jokes, remarks, etc., are only deemed discriminatory if the
employer has stated so in their written policy. Women are viewed as being
responsible for confronting harassment themselves, such as by slapping the
harasser in the face. Law number 1385 of December 21, 2005 regulates this area.
France. Until May 4, 2012, article 222-33 of the French Criminal Code described
sexual harassment as, "The fact of harassing anyone in order to obtain favors
of a sexual nature...". Since 2002, it recognized the possibility of sexual
harassment between co-workers and not only by supervisors. On May 4, 2012, the
http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr (French supreme Court) quashed the
definition of the criminal code as being too vague. The 2012 decision resulted
from a law on priority preliminary rulings on the issue of constitutionality.
As a consequence to this decision, all pending procedures before criminal
courts are cancelled. Several feminists NGO, such as AFVT criticized this
decision. A new law should be voted rapidly according to the declarations of
the President FranÃ§ois Hollande, the Minister of Justice (Christine Taubira)
and the Minister of Equality (Najat Belkacem). In addition to criminal
provisions, the French labor code also prohibits sexual harassment. The
legislator voted a law in 2008 that copied the 2002/73/EC Directive definition
without modifying the French Labour Code. India. Sexual harassment in India is
termed "Eve teasing" and is described as: unwelcome sexual gesture or behaviour
whether directly or indirectly as sexually coloured remarks; physical contact
and advances; showing pornography; a demand or request for sexual favours; any
other unwelcome physical, verbal/non-verbal conduct being sexual in nature. The
critical factor is the unwelcomeness of the behaviour, thereby making the
impact of such actions on the recipient more relevant rather than intent of the
perpetrator. According to the Indian constitution, sexual harassment infringes
the fundamental right of a woman to gender equality under Article 14 and her
right to life and live with dignity under Article 21. Although there is no
specific law against sexual harassment at workplace in India, many provisions
in other legislations provide some protection against sexual harassment at
workplace, such as Indian Penal Code (IPC) Section 354 which deals with
"assault or criminal force to a woman with the intent to outrage her modesty,
and Section 509, IPC deals with "word, gesture or act intended to insult the
modesty of a woman. In 1997, the Supreme Court of India in a Public Interest
Litigation, defined sexual harassment at workplace, preventive measures and
redress mechanism. The judgement is popularly known as Vishaka Judgement.
Israel. The 1998 Israeli Sexual Harassment Law interprets sexual harassment
broadly, and prohibits the behavior as a discriminatory practice, a restriction
of liberty, an offence to human dignity, a violation of every person's right to
elementary respect, and an infringement of the right to privacy. Additionally,
the law prohibits intimidation or retaliation that accommodates sexual
harassment. Intimidation or retaliation thus related to sexual harassment are
defined by the law as "prejudicial treatment". Pakistan. Pakistan has adopted a
Code of Conduct for Gender Justice in the Workplace that will deal with cases
of sexual harassment. The Alliance Against Sexual Harassment At workplace
(AASHA) announced they would be working with the committee to establish
guidelines for the proceedings. AASHA defines sexual harassment much the same
as it is defined in the U.S. and other cultures. Philippines. The Anti-Sexual
Harassment Act of 1995 was enacted "primarily to protect and respect the
dignity of workers, employees, and applicants for employment as well as
students in educational institutions or training centers. This law, consisting
of ten sections, provides for a clear definition of work, education or
training-related sexual harassment and specifies the acts constituting sexual
harassment. It likewise provides for the duties and liabilities of the employer
in cases of sexual harassment, and sets penalties for violations of its
provisions. It is to be noted that a victim of sexual harassment is not barred
from filing a separate and independent action for damages and other relief
aside from filing the charge for sexual harassment." Poland. There is no
special provision in the employment law that provides for moral or sexual
harassment; however it is commonly accepted by the jurisprudence, that sexual
harassment occurs when the employee is subjected to acts of another person in
order to obtain favours of a sexual nature. Moral harassment occurs when en
employee is subjected to acts which may result in a deterioration of his/her
conditions of employment or undermine his/her rights and dignity as well as
affect his/her physical or moral health. These definitions are not legal ones,
but definitions accepted by the jurisprudence. Russia. In the Criminal Code,
Russian Federation, (CC RF), there exists a law which prohibits utilization of
an office position and material dependence for coercion of sexual interactions
(Article 118, current CC RF). However, according to the Moscow Center for
Gender Studies, in practice, the courts do not examine these issues. The Daily
Telegraph quotes a survey in which "100 per cent of female professionals Russia
said they had been subjected to sexual harassment by their bosses, 32 per cent
said they had had intercourse with them at least once and another seven per
cent claimed to have been raped." Switzerland. A ban on discrimination was
included in the Federal Constitution (Article 4, Paragraph 2 of the old Federal
Constitution) in 1981 and adopted in Article 8, paragraph 2 of the revised
Constitution. The ban on sexual harassment in the workplace forms part of the
Federal Act on Gender Equality (GEA) of 24 March 1995, where it is one of
several provisions which prohibit discrimination in employment and which are
intended to promote equality. Article 4 of the GEA defines the circumstances,
Article 5 legal rights and Article 10 protection against dismissal during the
complaints procedure. Article 328, paragraph 1 of the Code of Obligations (OR),
Article 198 (2) of the Penal Code (StGB) and Article 6, paragraph 1 of the
Employment Act (ArG) contain further statutory provisions on the ban on sexual
harassment. The ban on sexual harassment is intended exclusively for employers,
within the scope of their responsibility for protection of legal personality,
mental and physical well-being and health. Article 4 of the GEA of 1995 defines
sexual harassment in the workplace as follows: "Any behaviour of a sexual
nature or other behaviour attributable to gender which affronts the human
dignity of males and females in the workplace. This expressly includes threats,
the promise of advantages, the application of coercion and the exercise of
pressure to achieve an accommodation of a sexual nature." United Kingdom. The
Discrimination Act of 1975, was modified to establish sexual harassment as a
form of discrimination in 1986. It states that harassment occurs where there is
unwanted conduct on the ground of a person's sex or unwanted conduct of a
sexual nature and that conduct has the purpose or effect of violating a
person's dignity, or of creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading,
humiliating or offensive environment for them. If an employer treats someone
less favourably because they have rejected, or submitted to, either form of
harassment described above, this is also harassment. United States. Evolution
of sexual harassment law. "Main Articles: Anita Hill, Clarence Thomas and the
Clarence Thomas Sexual Harassment Allegations" Workplace. In the US, the Civil
Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employment discrimination based on race, sex,
color, national origin or religion. Initially only intended to combat sexual
harassment of women,{42 U.S.C. Â§ 2000e-2} the prohibition of sex
discrimination covers both females and males. This discrimination occurs when
the sex of the worker is made as a condition of employment (i.e. all female
waitpersons or male carpenters) or where this is a job requirement that does
not mention sex but ends up barring many more persons of one sex than the other
from the job (such as height and weight limits). "Barnes v. Train" (1974) is
commonly viewed as the first sexual harassment case in America, even though the
term "sexual harassment" was not used. In 1976, "Williams v. Saxbe" established
sexual harassment as a form of sex discrimination when sexual advances by a
male supervisor towards a female employee, if proven, would be deemed an
artificial barrier to employment placed before one gender and not another. In
1980 the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) issued regulations
defining sexual harassment and stating it was a form of sex discrimination
prohibited by the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In the 1986 case of "Meritor
Savings Bank v. Vinson", the Supreme Court first recognized "sexual harassment"
as a violation of Title VII, established the standards for analyzing whether
the conduct was welcome and levels of employer liability, and that speech or
conduct in itself can create a "hostile environment". The Civil Rights Act of
1991 added provisions to Title VII protections including expanding the rights
of women to sue and collect compensatory and punitive damages for sexual
discrimination or harassment, and the case of "Ellison v. Brady" resulted in
rejecting the reasonable person standard in favor of the "reasonable woman
standard" which allowed for cases to be analyzed from the perspective of the
complainant and not the defendant. Also in 1991, "Jenson v. Eveleth Taconite
Co." became the first sexual harassment case to be given class action status,
paving the way for others. Seven years later, in 1998, this case would
establish new precedents for setting limits on the "discovery" process in
sexual harassment cases, and allowing psychological injuries from the
litigation process to be included in assessing damages awards. In the same
year, the courts concluded in "Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, Florida", and
"Burlington v. Ellerth", that employers are liable for harassment by their
employees. Moreover, "Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services" set the precedent
for same-sex harassment, and sexual harassment without motivation of "sexual
desire", stating that any discrimination based on sex is actionable so long as
it places the victim in an objectively disadvantageous working condition,
regardless of the gender of either the victim, or the harasser. In the 2006
case of "Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White", the standard for
retaliation against a sexual harassment complainant was revised to include any
adverse employment decision or treatment that would be likely to dissuade a
"reasonable worker" from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.
During 2007 alone, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and related
state agencies received 12,510 new charges of sexual harassment on the job.
Education. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (United States) states
"No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from
participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination
under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial
assistance." In "Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools" (1992), the U.S.
Supreme Court held that private citizens could collect damage awards when
teachers sexually harassed their students. In "Bethel School District No. 403
v. Fraser" (1986) the courts ruled that schools have the power to discipline
students if they use "obscene, profane language or gestures" which could be
viewed as substantially interfering with the educational process, and
inconsistent with the "fundamental values of public school education." Under
regulations issued in 1997 by the U.S. Department of Education, which
administers Title IX, school districts should be held responsible for
harassment by educators if the harasser "was aided in carrying out the sexual
harassment of students by his or her position of authority with the
institution." In "Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education", and "Murrell v.
School Dist. No. 1", 1999, schools were assigned liability for peer-to-peer
sexual harassment if the plaintiff sufficiently demonstrated that the
administration's response shows "deliberate indifference" to "actual knowledge"
of discrimination. Additionally. There are a number of legal options for a
complainant in the U.S.: mediation, filing with the EEOC or filing a claim
under a state Fair Employment Practices (FEP) statute (both are for workplace
sexual harassment), filing a common law tort, etc. Not all sexual harassment
will be considered severe enough to form the basis for a legal claim. However,
most often there are several types of harassing behaviors present, and there is
no minimum level for harassing conduct under the law. "Many more experienced
sexual harassment than have a solid legal case against the accused." Because of
this, and the common preference for settling, few cases ever make it to federal
court. The section below "EEOC Definition" describes the legal definitions that
have been created for sexual harassment in the workplace. Definitions similar
to the EEOC defnition have been created for academic environments in the U.S.
Department of Education Sexual Harassment Guidance. EEOC Definition. 1. and 2.
are called "quid pro quo" (Latin for "this for that" or "something for
something"). They are essentially "sexual bribery", or promising of benefits,
and "sexual coercion". Type 3. known as "hostile work environment," is by far
the most common form. This form is less clear cut and is more subjective. Note:
a workplace harassment complainant "must" file with the EEOC and receive a
"right to sue" clearance, before they can file a lawsuit against a company in
federal court. Sex discrimination can take two forms, either 1) "Hostile Work
Environment Harassment" or 2) "Quid Pro Quo Harassment." "Quid pro quo" sexual
harassment. Quid pro quo means "this for that". In the workplace, this occurs
when a job benefit is directly tied to an employee submitting to unwelcome
sexual advances. For example, a supervisor promises an employee a raise if he
or she will go out on a date with him or her, or tells an employee he or she
will be fired if he or she doesn't sleep with him or her. Quid pro quo
harassment also occurs when an employee makes an evaluative decision, or
provides or withholds professional opportunities based on another employee's
submission to verbal, nonverbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature. Â Quid
pro quo harassment is equally unlawful whether the victim resists and suffers
the threatened harm or submits and thus avoids the threatened harm. "Hostile
environment" sexual harassment. This occurs when an employee is subjected to
comments of a sexual nature, unwelcome physical contact, or offensive sexual
materials as a regular part of the work environment. For the most part, a
single isolated incident will not be enough to prove hostile environment
harassment unless it involves extremely outrageous and egregious conduct. The
courts will try to decide whether the conduct is both "serious" and "frequent."
Supervisors, managers, co-workers and even customers can be responsible for
creating a hostile environment. Probably the most famous hostile environment
sexual harassment case to date is "Jenson v. Eveleth Taconite Co." which
inspired the movie "North Country". The line between "quid pro quo" and
"hostile environment" harassment is not always clear and the two forms of
harassment often occur together. For example, an employee's job conditions are
affected when a sexually hostile work environment results in a constructive
discharge. At the same time, a supervisor who makes sexual advances toward a
subordinate employee may communicate an implicit threat to retaliate against
her if she does not comply. "Hostile environment" harassment may acquire
characteristics of "quid pro quo" harassment if the offending supervisor abuses
his authority over employment decisions to force the victim to endure or
participate in the sexual conduct. Sexual harassment may culminate in a
retaliatory discharge if a victim tells the harasser or her employer she will
no longer submit to the harassment, and is then fired in retaliation for this
protest. Under these circumstances it would be appropriate to conclude that
both harassment and retaliation in violation of section 704(a) of Title VII
have occurred." Sexual orientation discrimination. There are no federal laws
prohibiting discrimination against employees based on their sexual orientation.
However, Executive Order 13087, signed by President Bill Clinton, outlaws
discrimination based on sexual orientation against federal government
employees. If a small business owner owns his or her business in a state where
there is a law against sexual orientation discrimination, the owner must abide
to the law regardless of there not being a federal law. Twenty states and the
District of Columbia have laws against this form of discrimination in the
workplace. These states include California, Connecticut, Colorado, Hawaii,
Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New
Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont,
Washington, and Wisconsin. For example, California has laws in place to protect
employees who may have been discriminated against based upon sexual orientation
or perceived sexual orientation. California law prohibits discrimination
against those "with traits not stereotypically associated with their gender,"
such as mannerisms, appearance, or speech. Sexual orientation discrimination
comes up, for instance, when employers enforce a dress code, permit women to
wear makeup but not men, or require men and women to only use restrooms
designated for their particular sex regardless of whether they are
transgendered. Retaliation. Retaliation has occurred when an employee suffers a
"negative action" after he or she has made a report of sexual harassment, file
a grievance, assist someone else with a complaint, or participate in
discrimination prevention activities. Negative actions can include being fired,
demotion, suspension, denial of promotion, poor evaluation, unfavorable job re-
assignmentâ€”any adverse employment decision or treatment that would be likely
to dissuade a "reasonable worker" from making or supporting a charge of
discrimination. (See "Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White")
Retaliation is as illegal as the sexual harassment itself, but also as
difficult to prove. Also, retaliation is illegal even if the original charge of
sexual harassment was not proven. Criticism. Though the phrase "sexual
harassment" is generally acknowledged to include clearly damaging and morally
deplorable behavior, its boundaries can be broad and controversial.
Accordingly, misunderstandings can abound. Moreover, sexual harassment law has
been highly criticized by experts, such as the criminal defense lawyer Alan
Dershowitz and the legal writer and libertarian Eugene Volokh, for imposing on
the right to free speech. Prof. in organizational studies Jana Raver from the
Queen's School of Business criticized sexual harassment policy in the "Ottawa
Business Journal" as helping maintain archaic stereotypes of women as
"delicate, asexual creatures" who require special protection when at the same
time complaints are lowering company profits. Camille Paglia says that young
girls can end up acting in such ways as to make sexual harassment easier, such
that for example, by acting "nice" they can become a target. Paglia commented
in an interview with Playboy, "Realize the degree to which your niceness may
invoke people to say lewd and pornographic things to you--sometimes to violate
your niceness. The more you blush, the more people want to do it." Other
critics assert that sexual harassment is a very serious problem, but current
views focus too heavily on sexuality rather than on the type of conduct that
undermines the ability of women or men to work together effectively. Viki
Shultz, a law professor at Yale University comments, "Many of the most
prevalent forms of harassment are designed to maintain work-particularly the
more highly rewarded lines of work-as bastions of male competence and
authority." Feminist Jane Gallop sees this evolution of the definition of
sexual harassment as coming from a "split" between what she calls "power
feminists" who are pro-sex (like herself) and what she calls "victim
feminists," who are not. She argues that the split has helped lead to a
"perversion" of the definition of sexual harassment, which used to be about
sexism but has come to be about anything that's sexual. There is also concern
over abuses of sexual harassment policy by individuals as well as by employers
and administrators using false and/or frivolous accusations as a way of
expelling employees they want to eliminate for other reasons. Plus these
employees often have virtually no recourse thanks to the at-will law in most US
states. O'Donohue and Bowers outlined 14 possible pathways to false allegations
of sexual harassment: "lying, borderline personality disorder, histrionic
personality disorder, psychosis, gender prejudice, substance abuse, dementia,
false memories, false interpretations, biased interviews, sociopathy,
personality disorders not otherwise specified." There is also discussion of
whether some recent trends towards more revealing clothing and permissive
habits have created a more sexualized general environment, in which some forms
of communication are unfairly labeled harassment, but are simply a reaction to
greater sexualization in everyday environments. There are many debates about
how organizations should deal with sexual harassment. Some observers feel
strongly that organizations should be held to a zero tolerance standard of
"Must report - must investigate - must punish." Others write that those who
feel harassed should in most circumstances have a choice of options.
