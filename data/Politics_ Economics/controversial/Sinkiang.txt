Xinjiang Xinjiang (XUAR) (; ; ; Postal map spelling: Sinkiang) is an autonomous
region (Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region) of the People's Republic of China,
located in the northwest of the country. It is the largest Chinese
administrative division and spans over 1.6 million km2. Xinjiang borders
Russia, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and
India, has abundant oil reserves and is China's largest natural gas-producing
region. It is home to a number of different ethnic groups including the Uyghur,
Han, Kazakh, Hui, Kyrgyz, and Mongol, with a majority of the population
adhering to Islam. More than a dozen autonomous prefectures and counties for
minorities are located in Xinjiang. Older English-language reference works
often refer to the area as Chinese Turkestan, Sinkiang, and East Turkestan.
Xinjiang is divided into the Dzungarian Basin in the north and the Tarim Basin
in the south by a mountain range. Only about 4.3% of Xinjiang's land area is
fit for human habitation. With a documented history of at least 2,500 years, a
succession of peoples and empires has vied for control over all or parts of
this territory. Prior to the 21st century, all or part of the region has been
ruled, controlled, influenced at times by the Tocharians, Yuezhi, Xiongnu
Empire, Kushan Empire, Han Empire, Former Liang, Former Qin, Later Liang,
Western Li√°ng, Tang Dynasty, Uyghur Khaganate, Kara-Khanid Khanate, Mongol
Empire (Yuan Dynasty), Dzungar Khanate, Qing Dynasty, the Republic of China,
and, since 1950, the People's Republic of China. Names. Xinjiang was previously
known as Xiyu (Ë•øÂüü) or Qurighar (ÿ∫€ïÿ±ÿ®ŸâŸä ÿØŸâŸäÿßÿ±), meaning Western
Region, under the Han Dynasty, which drove the Xiongnu empire out of the region
in 60 BC. This was in an effort to secure the profitable Silk Road. It was
known as Huijiang (ÂõûÁñÜ), meaning "Muslim Frontier," during the Qing Dynasty
before becoming the province of Xinjiang, which literally means "New Frontier"
or "New Border", in the 1880s. The general region of Xinjiang has been known by
many other names in earlier times including: Ë•øÂüü (Mandarin: xiyu) = 'Western
Regions', Chinese Tartary, High Tartary, East Chagatay, Mugholistan, Kashgaria,
Altishahr ('the six cities' of the Tarim), Little Bokhara and Serindia. The
name "Xinjiang", which literally means "New Frontier", was given during the
Qing Dynasty. Older English-language reference works often refer to the area as
Chinese Turkestan, Sinkiang, East Turkestan, or Uyghuristan. More specifically,
at times, the term East Turkestan only referred to the Xinjiang area south of
the Tian Shan mountains, North of the Tian Shan was called Dzungaria
(Zungaria). Description. Xinjiang is a large, sparsely populated area, spanning
over 1.6 million km2 (comparable in size to Iran), which takes up about one
sixth of the country's territory. Xinjiang borders the Tibet Autonomous Region
and India's Leh District to the south and Qinghai and Gansu provinces to the
southeast, Mongolia to the east, Russia to the north, and Kazakhstan,
Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India to the west. The east-
west chain of the Tian Shan Mountains separate Dzungaria in the north from the
Tarim Basin in the south. Dzungaria is dry steppe. The Tarim Basin is desert
surrounded by oases. In the east is the Turpan Depression. In the west, the
Tian Shan split, forming the Ili River valley. History. Early history.
According to J.P. Mallory and Victor H. Mair, the Chinese sources describe the
existence of "white people with lightish hair" or the "Bai" people in the "Shan
Hai Jing", who lived beyond their northwestern border. The well-preserved Tarim
mummies with Caucasoid features, often with reddish or blond hair, today
displayed at the √úr√ºmqi Museum and dated to the 3rd century BC, have been
found in precisely the same area of the Tarim Basin. Various nomadic tribes
such as the Yuezhi were part of the large migration of Indo-European speaking
peoples who were settled in eastern Central Asia (possibly as far as Gansu) at
that time. The Ordos culture situated at northern China east of the Yuezhi, are
another example. Nomadic cultures such as the Yuezhi are documented in the area
of Xinjiang where the first known reference to the Yuezhi was made in 645 BC by
the Chinese Guan Zhong in his Guanzi ÁÆ°Â≠ê (Guanzi Essays: 73: 78: 80: 81). He
described the Yuzhi Á¶∫Ê∞è, or Niuzhi ÁâõÊ∞è, as a people from the north-west
who supplied jade to the Chinese from the nearby mountains of Yuzhi Á¶∫Ê∞è at
Gansu. The supply of jade from the Tarim Basin from ancient times is indeed
well documented archaeologically: "It is well known that ancient Chinese rulers
had a strong attachment to jade. All of the jade items excavated from the tomb
of Fuhao of the Shang dynasty, more than 750 pieces, were from Khotan in modern
Xinjiang. As early as the mid-first millennium BC the Yuezhi engaged in the
jade trade, of which the major consumers were the rulers of agricultural
China.". Watson, Burton. Trans. 1993. "Records of the Grand Historian of China:

Northern Silk Road, the Tarim and Dzungaria regions were known as the Western
Regions. At the beginning of the Han Dynasty (206 BC ‚Äì AD 220), the region
was subservient to the Xiongnu, a powerful nomadic people based in modern
Mongolia. Han Dynasty. In the 2nd century BC, Han China sent Zhang Qian as an
envoy to the states in the region, beginning several decades of struggle
between the Xiongnu and Han China over dominance of the region, eventually
ending in Chinese success. In 60 BC Han China established the Protectorate of
the Western Regions (Ë•øÂüüÈÉΩË≠∑Â∫ú) at Wulei (ÁÉèÂ£ò; near modern Luntai) to
oversee the entire region as far west as the Pamir. Tarim Basin was under the
influence and control of the Han dynasty. During the usurpation of Wang Mang in
China, the dependent states of the protectorate rebelled and returned to
domination in AD 13. Over the next century, Han China conducted several
expeditions into the region, re-establishing the protectorate from 74 to 76, 91
to 107, and from 123 onward. These campaigns expanded Han sovereignty into the
Tarim Basin and Central Asia. This region was also ruled by the Kushan Empire
between 114 and 168. After the fall of the Han Dynasty, the protectorate
continued to be maintained by Cao Wei (until 265) and the Western Jin Dynasty
(from 265 onwards). Ptolemy had quite good information on Xinjiang, taken from
three different accounts. A succession of peoples. The Western Jin Dynasty
succumbed to successive waves of invasions by nomads from the north at the
beginning of the 4th century. The short-lived kingdoms (both Han and non-Han)
that ruled northwestern China one after the other, including Former Liang,
Former Qin, Later Liang, and Western Li√°ng, all attempted to maintain the
protectorate, with varying extents and degrees of success. After the final
reunification of northern China under the Northern Wei empire, its protectorate
controlled what is now the southeastern third of Xinjiang. Local states such as
Shule, Yutian, Guizi and Qiemo controlled the western half, while the central
region around Turpan was controlled by Gaochang, remnants of a state (Northern
Liang) that once ruled part of what is now Gansu province in northwestern
China. Tang Dynasty. The Tang Dynasty was established in 618, and would prove
to be one of the most expansionist dynasties in Chinese history. Starting from
the 620's and 630's, Tang China conducted a series of expeditions against the
Tujue, eventually forcing the surrender of the western Tujue in 657. Xinjiang
was placed under the Anxi Protectorate (ÂÆâË•øÈÉΩË≠∑Â∫ú; "Protectorate
Pacifying the West"). The protectorate did not outlast the decline of Tang
China in the 8th century. Uyghur Khaganate and Kara-Khanid Khanate. During the
devastating Anshi Rebellion, Tibet invaded Tang China on a wide front from
Xinjiang to Yunnan, occupied the Tang capital Chang'an in 763 for 16 days, and
taking control of southern Xinjiang by the end of the century. At the same
time, the Uyghur Khaganate took control of northern Xinjiang, as well as much
of the rest of Central Asia, including Mongolia. As both Tibet and the Uyghur
Khaganate declined in the mid-9th century, the Kara-Khanid Khanate, which was a
confederation of Turkic tribes such as the Karluks, Chigils and Yaghmas, took
control of western Xinjiang in the 10th century and the 11th century.
Meanwhile, after the Uyghur khanate in Mongolia had been smashed by the Kirghiz
in 840, branches of the Uyghurs established themselves in Qocha (Karakhoja) and
Beshbalik near today's Turfan and Urumchi. This Uyghur state would remain in
eastern Xinjiang until the 13th century, though it would be subject to various
overlords during that time. The Kara-Khanids converted to Islam, whereas the
Uyghur state in eastern Xinjiang remained Manicheaean, but later converting to
Buddhism. In 1132, remnants of the Khitan Empire from Manchuria entered
Xinjiang, fleeing the onslaught of the Jurchens into north China. They
established an exile regime, the Kara-Khitan Khanate, which became overlord
over both Kara-Khanid-held and Uyghur-held parts of the Tarim Basin for the
next century. Mongol Empire, Chagatai Khanate, and Yuan Dynasty. After Genghis
Khan had unified Mongolia and began his advance west, the Uyghur state in the
Turpan-Urumchi area offered its allegiance to the Mongols in 1209, contributing
taxes and troops to the Mongol imperial effort. In return, the Uyghur rulers
retained control of their kingdom. By contrast, Genghis Khan's Mongol Empire
conquered the Kara-Khitan in 1218. Because the Kara-Khitan had persecuted
Islam, the Mongols were met as liberators in the Kashgar area. During the era
of the Mongol Empire, the Qubilaid Yuan Dynasty vied for rule with the Chagatai
Khanate in the area, with the latter taking control of most of this region.
After the break-up of the Chagatai Khanate into smaller khanates in the mid-
14th century, the region fractured and was ruled by various Persianized Mongol
Khans simultaneously, including the ones of Mogholistan (with the assistance of
the local Dughlat Emirs), Uigurstan (later Turpan) and Kashgaria. These leaders
engaged in numerous wars with each other and both the Timurids of Transoxania
to the West and the Western Mongols to the East, the successor Chagatai regime
based in Mongolia and in China. Although there were high points in Persian
culture reached (e.g. the Dughlat historian Hamid-mirza), succession crises and
internal divisions (Kashgaria split in two for centuries) meant that this
region almost completely fades from the history books during the 16th and 17th
centuries. In the 17th century, the Mongolian Dzungars established an empire
over much of the region. Dzungar Empire. The Mongolian Dzungar (also Jungar,
Zunghar or Zungar; Mongolian: –ó“Ø“Ø–Ω–≥–∞—Ä Z√º√ºngar) is the collective
identity of several Oirat tribes that formed and maintained one of the last
nomadic empires. The Dzungar Khanate covered the area called Dzungaria and
stretched from the west end of the Great Wall of China to present-day eastern
Kazakhstan, and from present-day northern Kyrgyzstan to southern Siberia (most
of this area is renamed to Xinjiang after the fall of the Dzungar Empire). It
existed from the early 17th century to the mid-18th century. Qing Dynasty. The
Manchu Qing Dynasty gained control over eastern Xinjiang as a result of a long
struggle with the Zunghars (Dzungars) that began in the 17th century. In 1755,
with the help of the Oirat nobel Amursana, the Qing attacked Ghulja, and
captured the Zunghar khan. After Amursana's request to be declared Zunghar Khan
went unanswered, he led a revolt against the Qing. Over the next two years,
Qing armies destroyed the remnants of the Zunghar khanate and colonised parts
of Xinjiang with Han and Hui Chinese. The Dzungars suffered important loss in
the brutal campaigns and the smallpox epidemic at the time. One writer, Wei
Yuan, described the resulting desolation in what is now northern Xinjiang as:
"an empty plain for several thousand "li", with no Oirat yurt except those
surrendered." It has been estimated that 80% of the 600,000 or more Zunghars
were destroyed by a combination of disease and warfare, and it took generations
for it to recover. After the defeat of the Dzungars, the Qing made members of a
clan of sufi shaykhs known as the Khojas, rulers in the western Tarim Basin,
south of the Tianshan Mts. In 1758‚Äì59, however, rebellions against this
arrangement broke out both north and south of the Tian Shan mountains. The Qing
was thus forced, contrary to its initial intent, to establish a form of direct
military rule over both Zungharia (northern Xinjiang) and the Tarim Basin
(southern Xinjiang). The Manchus put the whole region under the rule of a
General of Ili (), headquartered at the fort of Huiyuan (the so-called "Manchu
Kuldja", or Yili), 30¬ km west of Ghulja (Yining). After 1759 state farms were
established, "especially in the vicinity of Urumchi, where there was fertile,
well-watered land and few people." From 1760 to 1830 more state farms were
opened and the Chinese population in Xinjiang grew rapidly to about 155,000.
Jahangir Khoja invaded Kashgar in 1826 and the Khanate of Kokand conducted
raids on Xinjiang. A large slave trade existed in Xinjiang during this time. By
the mid-19th century, the Russian Empire was encroaching upon Qing China along
its entire northern frontier. The Opium Wars and Taiping and other rebellion's
in "China proper" had severely restricted the dynasty's ability to maintain its
garrisons in distant Xinjiang. In 1864 both Chinese Muslims (Hui) and Uyghurs
rebelled in Xinjiang cities, following an on-going Chinese Muslim Rebellion in
Gansu and Shaanxi provinces further east. Yaqub Beg's Turkic Muslim troops also
committed massacres upon the Chinese Muslims. In 1865, Yaqub Beg, a warlord
from the neighbouring Khanate of Kokand, entered Xinjiang via Kashgar, and
conquered nearly all of Xinjiang over the next six years. At the Battle of
√úr√ºmqi (1870) Yaqub Beg's Turkic forces, allied with a Han Chinese militia,
attacked and besieged Chinese Muslim forces in Urumqi. In 1871, Russia took
advantage of the chaotic situation and seized the rich Ili River valley,
including Gulja. By then, Qing China held onto only a few strongholds,
including Tacheng. Yaqub Beg's rule lasted until General Zuo Zongtang (also
known as General Tso) reconquered the region between 1875 and 1877 for Qing
China. In 1881, Qing China recovered the Gulja region through diplomatic
negotiations (Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1881)). In 1884, (1882 according to
some sources), Qing China established Xinjiang ("new frontier") as a province,
formally applying onto it the political system of "China proper", and dropping
the old name of Huijiang or 'Muslimland'. Republican era. In 1912, the Qing
Dynasty was replaced by the Republic of China. Yuan Dahua, the last Qing
governor of Xinjiang, fled. One of his subordinates, Yang Zengxin (Êù®Â¢ûÊñ∞),
took control of the province and acceded in name to the Republic of China in
March of the same year. Through Machiavellian politics and clever balancing of
mixed ethnic constituencies, Yang maintained control over Xinjiang until his
assassination in 1928. The Kumul Rebellion and other rebellions arose against
his successor Jin Shuren (ÈáëÊ ë‰ªÅ) in the early 1930s throughout Xinjiang,
involving Uyghurs, other Turkic groups, and Hui (Muslim) Chinese. Jin drafted
White Russians to crush the revolt. In the Kashgar region on November 12, 1933,
the short-lived self-proclaimed East Turkistan Republic was declared, after
some debate over whether the proposed independent state should be called "East
Turkestan" or "Uyghuristan." The region claimed by the ETR in theory
encompassed Kashgar, Khotan and Aqsu prefectures in southwestern Xinjiang. The
Chinese Muslim Kuomintang 36th Division (National Revolutionary Army) destroyed
the army of the First East Turkestan Republic at the Battle of Kashgar (1934),
bringing the Republic to an end after the Chinese Muslims executed the two
Emirs of the Republic, Abdullah Bughra and Nur Ahmad Jan Bughra. The Soviet
Union invaded the province in the Soviet Invasion of Xinjiang. In the Xinjiang
War (1937), the entire province was brought under the control of northeast
Chinese warlord Sheng Shicai (Áõõ‰∏ñÊâç), who ruled Xinjiang for the next
decade with close support from the Soviet Union, many of whose ethnic and
security policies Sheng instituted in Xinjiang. The Soviet Union maintained a
military base in Xinjiang and had several military and economic advisors
deployed in the region. Sheng invited a group of Chinese Communists to
Xinjiang, including Mao Zedong's brother Mao Zemin, but in 1943, fearing a
conspiracy, Sheng executed them all, including Mao Zemin. 1949‚Äìpresent. A
Second East Turkistan Republic (2nd ETR, also known as the Three Districts
Revolution) existed from 1944 to 1949 with Soviet support in what is now Ili
Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture (Ili, Tarbagatay and Altay Districts) in northern
Xinjiang. The Second East Turkistan Republic came to an end when the People's
Liberation Army entered Xinjiang in 1949. Also, five ETR leaders, who would
negotiate the final status of East Turkistan with the Chinese, died in an air
crash in 1949 in Soviet airspace over the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic. The
Chinese Muslim General Bai Chongxi advocated swamping Xinjiang with disbanded
Chinese soldiers to prevent the Soviet union from seizing control during this
time. According to the PRC interpretation, the 2nd ETR was Xinjiang's
revolution, a positive part of the communist revolution in China; the 2nd ETR
acceded to and welcomed the PLA when it entered Xinjiang, a process known as
the Peaceful Liberation of Xinjiang. However, independence advocates view the
ETR as an effort to establish an independent state, and the subsequent PLA
entry as an invasion. The autonomous region of the PRC was established on
October 1, 1955, replacing the province. The PRC's first nuclear test was
carried out at Lop Nur, Xinjiang, on October 16, 1964. Although reports in
western media report that between 100,000 and 200,000 people may have been
killed in the testing, the Lop Nur area has not been permanently inhabited
since about 1920 and PRC media dispute these numbers, but without providing an
alternate number. During the Great Chinese Famine (1958‚Äì1961), Xinjiang
experienced a great emigration of residents both to the Soviet Union and to
East China. After a number of student demonstrations in the 1980s, the Baren
Township riot of April 1990 led to more than 20 deaths. 1997 saw the Ghulja
Incident and Urumqi bus bombs, while police continue to battle with religious
separatists from the East Turkestan Islamic Movement. Han Youwen, a Salar
General, once served as Vice Chairman of Xinjiang. During the Cold War and the
Sino-Soviet split, China stationed military forces in Xinjiang to guard against
Soviet attack, and the Chinese used Xinjiang to supply and train anti Soviet
Islamic militants during the Islamic insurgency against the Soviet backed
Afghan communists. During the Sino-Soviet split, strained relations between
China and Soviet Russia resulted in bloody border clashes and mutual backing
for the opponents enemies. China and Afghanistan had neutral relations with
each other during the King's rule. When the pro Soviet Afghan Communists seized
power in Afghanistan in 1978, relations between China and the Afghan communists
quickly turned hostile. The Afghan pro Soviet communists supported China's
enemies in Vietnam and blamed China for supporting Afghan anti communist
militants. China responded to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan by supporting
the Afghan Mujahidin and ramping up their military presence near Afghanistan in
Xinjiang. China acquired military equipment from America to defend itself from
Soviet attack. The People's Liberation Army trained and supported the Afghan
Mujahidin during the Soviet war in Afghanistan. China moved its training camps
for the mujahideen from Pakistan into China itself. Hundreds of millions worth
of anti aircraft missiles, rocket launchers and machine guns were given to the
Mujahidin by the Chinese. Chinese military advisors and army troops were
present with the Mujahidin during training. In recent years Xinjiang has been a
focal point of ethnic and other tensions. Recent incidents include the 2007
Xinjiang raid, a thwarted 2008 suicide bombing attempt on a China Southern
Airlines flight, and the 2008 Xinjiang attack which resulted in the deaths of
sixteen police officers four days before the Beijing Olympics. Further
incidents include the July 2009 √úr√ºmqi riots, the September 2009 Xinjiang
unrest, and the 2010 Aksu bombing that led to the trials of 376 people. From
1949 to 2001, education has expanded greatly in the region, with 6,221 primary
schools up from 1,335; 1,929 middle schools up from 9, and institutions of
higher learning at 21, up from 1. The illiteracy rate for young and middle-aged
people has decreased to less than 2%. Agricultural science has made inroads
into the region, as well as innovative methods of road construction in the
desert. Culturally, Xinjiang maintains 81 public libraries and 23 museums,
compared to none of each in 1949, and Xinjiang has 98 newspapers in 44
languages, up from 4 newspapers in 1952. According to official statistics, the
ratios of doctors, medical workers, medical clinics, and hospital beds to
people surpass the national average, and immunization rates have reached 85%.

geology. Xinjiang is the largest political subdivision of China‚Äîit accounts
for more than one sixth of China's total territory and a quarter of its
boundary length. It is split by the Tian Shan mountain range (), which divides
it into two large basins: the Dzungarian Basin in the north, and the Tarim
Basin in the south. Much of the Tarim Basin is dominated by the Taklamakan
Desert. The lowest point in Xinjiang, and in the entire PRC, is the Turpan
Depression, 155 metres below sea level; its highest point is the mountain K2,
8611 metres above sea level, on the border with Pakistan. Other mountain ranges
include the Pamir Mountains in the southeast, the Karakoram in the south, and
the Altai Mountains in the north. Most of Xinjiang is young geologically,
having been formed from the collision of the Indian plate with the Eurasian
plate, forming the Tian Shan, Kunlun Shan, and Pamir mountain ranges.
Consequently, Xinjiang is a major earthquake zone. Older geological formations
occur principally in the far north where the Junggar Block is geologically part
of Kazakhstan, and in the east which is part of the North China Craton.
Xinjiang has within its borders the point of land remotest from the sea, the
so-called Eurasian pole of inaccessibility () in the Dzoosotoyn Elisen Desert,
from the nearest coastline (straight-line distance). The Tian Shan mountain
range marks the Xinjiang-Kyrgyzstan border at the Torugart Pass (3752 m). The
Karakorum highway (KKH) links Islamabad, Pakistan with Kashgar over the
Khunjerab Pass. Rivers include the Tarim River. Time. Technically, people are
supposed to set their clock to the uniform time ‚Äì Beijing Time throughout
China, but due to Xinjiang's westernmost position in China, some local
residents follow their own unofficial time ‚Äì Xinjiang Time [http://
www.xinjiang.gov.cn/10018/10008/00017/2005/22694.htm](Xinjiang time corresponds
to the UTC+6 time zone, Beijing Time corresponds to UTC+8). Thus, for instance,
a movie that opens at 9:00¬ pm Beijing Time, opens at 7:00 Xinjiang Time.
Climate. Generally, a semi-arid or desert climate (K√∂ppen "BSk" or "BWk",
respectively) prevails in Xinjiang. The entire region is marked by great
seasonal differences in temperature and cold winters. During the summer, the
Turpan Depression usually records the hottest temperatures nationwide, with air
temperatures easily exceeding . In the far north and the highest mountain
elevations, however, winter temperatures regularly drop below . Politics. List

Government Economy. Xinjiang is known for its fruits and produce, including
grapes, melons, pears, cotton, wheat, silk, walnuts and sheep. Xinjiang also
has large deposits of minerals and oil. In the late 19th century the region was
noted for producing salt, soda, borax, gold, jade and coal. Xinjiang's nominal
GDP was approximately 220 billion RMB (28 billion USD) in 2004, and increased
to 657.4 billion RMB (104.3 billion USD) in 2011, due to exploration of the
regions abundant reserves of coal, crude oil and natural and the China Western
Development policy introduced by the State Council to boost economic
development in Western China. Its per capita GDP for 2009 was 19,798 RMB (2,898
USD), with a growth rate of 1.7%. Southern Xinjiang, with 95 per cent non-Han
population has an average per capita income half that of Xinjiang as a whole.
The oil and gas extraction industry in Aksu and Karamay is booming, with the
West‚ÄìEast Gas Pipeline connecting to Shanghai. The oil and petrochemical
sector account for 60% of Xinjiang's local economy. Xinjiang's exports amounted
to 19.3 billion USD, while imports turned out to be 2.9 billion USD in 2008.
Most of the overall import/export volume in Xinjiang was directed to and from
Kazakhstan through Ala Pass. China's first border free trade zone (Horgos Free
Trade Zone) was located at the Xinjiang-Kazakhstan border city of Horgos.
Horgos is the largest "land port" in China's western region and it has easy
access to the Central Asian market. Xinjiang also opened its second border
trade market to Kazakhstan in March 2006, the Jeminay Border Trade Zone.
Economic and Technological Development Zones. Urumqi Economic and Technological
Development Zone is located northwest of Urumqi. It was approved in 1994 by the
State Council as a national level economic and technological development zones.
It is located 1.5¬ km away from the Urumqi International Airport, 2¬ km from
the North Railway Station, and 10¬ km from the city center. Wu Chang Expressway
and 312 National Road passes through the Zone. The development has unique
resources and geographical advantages. Xinjiang's vast land, rich in various
resources, borders 8 countries. As the leading economic zone, it brings
together the resources of Xinjiang's industrial development, capital,
technology, information, personnel and other factors of production. Urumuqi
Export Processing Zone is located in Urumuqi Economic and Technology
Development Zone. It was established in 2007 as a state-level export processing
zone. Urumuqi Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone was established in 1992, and
it is the only high-tech development zone in Xinjiang, China. There are more
than 3470 enterprises in the zone, of which 23 are Fortune 500 companies. It
has a planned area of 9.8 square kilometres, and it is divided into 4 zones.
There are future plans to expand the zone. Demographics. The earliest Tarim
mummies, dated to 1800 BC, are of a Caucasoid physical type. East Asian
migrants arrived in the eastern portions of the Tarim Basin about 3,000 years
ago, while the Uighur peoples arrived after the collapse of the Orkon Uighur
Kingdom, based in modern-day Mongolia, around the year 842. Muslim Turkic
peoples in Xinjiang include Uyghurs, Uzbeks, Kyrgyz, Tatars and the Kazakhs;
Muslim Iranian peoples include Pamiris and the Sarikolis/Wakhis (often
conflated as Pamiris); and Muslim Sino-Tibetan peoples such as the Hui. Other
PRC ethnic groups in the region include Han, Mongols (Oirats, Dagur,
Dongxiang), Russians, Xibes, and Manchus. As of 1945, there were up to 70,000
persons of Russian origin living in Xinjiang. The Han Chinese of Xinjiang
arrived at different times, from different directions and social backgrounds:
they are descendants of criminals and officials who had been exiled from China
proper during the second half of the eighteenth and first half of the 19th
centuries; descendants of families of military and civil officers from Hunan,
Yunnan, Gansu and Manchuria; descendants of merchants from Shanxi, Tianjin,
Hubei and Hunan and descendants of peasants who started immigrating into the
region in 1776. Some Uighur scholars claim descent from both the Turkic Uighurs
and the pre-Turkic Tocharians (or Tokharians, whose language was Indo-
European), and relatively fair-skin, hair and eyes, as well as other so-called
'Caucasoid' physical traits, are not uncommon among them. In general Uyghurs
resemble those peoples who live around them in Afghanistan, Kyrgyzstan,
Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Pakistan. In 2002, there were 9,632,600 males
(growth rate of 1.0%) and 9,419,300 females (growth rate of 2.2%). The
population overall growth rate was 10.9‚Ä∞, with 16.3‚Ä∞ of birth rate and
5.4‚Ä∞ mortality rate. At the start of the 19th century, forty years after the
Qing reconquest, there were around 155,000 Han and Hui Chinese in northern
Xinjiang, and somewhat more than twice that number of Uyghurs in southern
Xinjiang. A census of the time tabulated ethnic shares of the population as 60%
Turkic and 30% Han. Before 1831 only a few hundred Chinese merchants lived in
southern Xinjiang oases (Tarim Basin), and only a few Uyghurs lived in northern
Xinjiang (Dzungaria). After 1831 the Qing permitted and encouraged Han Chinese
migration into the Tarim basin in southern Xinjiang, although with very little
success, and stationed permanent troops on the land there as well. Political
killings and expulsions of non Uyghur populations in the uprisings of the 1860s
and 1930s saw them experience a sharp decline as a percentage of the total
population though they rose once again in the periods of stability following
1880 (which saw Xinjiang increase its population from 1.2 million) and 1949.
From a low of 7% in 1953, the Han began to return to Xinjiang between then and
1964, where they comprised 33% of the population (54% Uyghur), similarly to
Qing times. A decade later, at the beginning of the Chinese economic reform in
1978, the demographic balance was 46% Uyghur and 40% Han; this has not changed
drastically until the last census in 2000, with the Uyghur population reduced
to 42%. Military personnel are not counted and national minorities are
undercounted in the Chinese census, as in most censuses. While some of the
shift has be attributed to an increased Han presence, Uyghurs have also
emigrated to other parts of China, where their numbers have increased steadily.
Uyghur independence activists claim that the Han population will dilute the
Uyghur character of the region, but the Han and Hui Chinese mostly live in
northern Xinjiang Dzungaria, and are separated from areas of historical Uyghur
dominance south of the Tian Shan mountains (southwestern Xinjiang), where
Uyghurs account for about 90% of the population. In general, Uyghurs are the
majority in southwestern Xinjiang, including the prefectures of Kashgar,
Khotan, Kizilsu, and Aksu (about 80% of Xinjiang's Uyghurs live in those four
prefectures), as well as Turpan prefecture in eastern Xinjiang. Han are the
majority in eastern and northern Xinjiang (Dzungaria), including the cities of
Urumqi, Karamay, Shihezi and the prefectures of Changjyi, Bortala,
Bayin'gholin, Ili (especially the cities of Kuitun), and Kumul. Kazakhs are
mostly concentrated in Ili prefecture in northern Xinjiang. Kazakhs are the
majority in the northernmost part of Xinjiang. Religion. Xinjiang is home to
several distinct ethnic groups of various religious traditions, with the
majority of the region's total population adhering to Islam. Afaq Khoja
Mausoleum and Id Kah Mosque in Kashgar are among the most important Islamic
sites in Xinjiang. Emin Minaret is another key Islamic site, in Turfan.
Bezeklik Thousand Buddha Caves is a major Buddhist site. According to one
source, more than 1% of the population are Christians. Media. The Xinjiang
Networking Transmission Limited operates the Urumqi People Broadcasting Station
and the Xinjiang People Broadcasting Station, broadcasting in Mandarin, Uyghur,
Kazakh and Mongolian. , there were fifty minority-language newspapers published
in Xinjiang, including the "Qapqal News", the world's only Xibe-language
newspaper. The "Xinjiang Economic Daily" is considered one of China's most
dynamic newspapers. For a time after the July 2009 riots, authorities placed
restrictions on the internet and text messaging, gradually permitting access to
websites like Xinhua's, until restoring Internet to the same level as the rest
of China on May 14, 2010. Sports. Xinjiang is home to the Xinjiang Guanghui
Flying Tigers professional basketball team of the Chinese Basketball
Association. The capital, Urumqi, is also home to the Xinjiang University
baseball team, an integrated Uyghur and Han group profiled in the documentary
film, Diamond in the Dunes. Transportation. Roads. In 2008, according to the
Xinjiang Transportation Network Plan, the government has focused construction
on State Road 314, Alar-Hotan Desert Highway, State Road 218, Qingshui River
Line-Yining Highway, and State Road 217, as well as other roads. The
construction of the first expressway in the mountainous area of Xinjiang began
a new stage in its construction on July 24, 2007. The 56¬ km highway linking
Sayram Lake and Guozi Valley in Northern Xinjiang area had cost 2.39 billion
yuan. The expressway is designed to improve the speed of national highway 312
in northern Xinjiang. The project started in August 2006 and several stages
have been fully operational since March 2007. Over 3,000 construction workers
have been involved. The 700 m-long Guozi Valley Cable Bridge over the
expressway is now currently being constructed, with the 24 main pile
foundations already completed. Highway 312 national highway Xinjiang section,
connects Xinjiang with China's east coast, central and western Asia, plus some
parts of Europe. It is a key factor in Xinjiang's economic development. The
population it covers is around 40 percent of the overall in Xinjiang, who
contribute half of the GDP in the area. Rail. Xinjiang is linked to the rest of
China by a single railway, the Lanzhou-Xinjiang (Lanxin) Railway, which runs
from √úr√ºmqi to Lanzhou through the Hexi Corridor in Gansu Province. This
railway connects the regional capital, √úr√ºmqi, with Turpan and Hami in
eastern Xinjiang. West of √úr√ºmqi, the Northern Xinjiang (Beijiang) Railway
runs along the northern footslopes of the Tian Shan range through Changji,
Shihezi, Kuytun and Jinghe to the Kazakh border at Alashankou, where it links
up with the Turkestan-Siberia Railway of Central Asia. The Lanxin and Beijiang
lines form part of the Trans-Eurasian Continental Railway, which extends from
Rotterdam, on the North Sea, to Lianyungang, on the East China Sea. The Second
√úr√ºmqi-Jinghe Railway opened in 2009 to supplement rail transport capacity on
the Northern Xinjiang Railway between √úr√ºmqi and Jinghe. From Jinghe, the
Jinghe-Yining-Horgos Railway heads southwest into the Ili River Valley to
Yining, Huocheng, and Khorgos, a second rail border crossing with Kazakhstan.
From Kuytun, the Kuytun-Beitun Railway runs north into the Junggar Basin to
Karamay and Beitun, near Altay in northern Xinjiang. The √úr√ºmqi-Dzungaria
Railway connects √úr√ºmqi with coal fields in the eastern Junggar Basin. The
Southern Xinjiang (Nanjiang) Railway branches off of the Lanxin Line at Turpan
and heads southwest along the southern footslopes of the Tian Shan into the
Tarim Basin, with stops at Yanqi, Korla, Kuqa, Aksu, Maralbexi (Bachu), Artux,
and Kashgar. From Kashgar, the Kashgar-Hotan Railway, follows the southern rim
of the Tarim to Hotan, with stops at Shule, Akto, Yengisar, Shache (Yarkant),
Yecheng (Karghilik), Moyu (Karakax). A high-speed railway between Urumqi and
Lanzhou is currently under construction.
