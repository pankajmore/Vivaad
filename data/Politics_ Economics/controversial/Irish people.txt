Irish people The Irish people ( or "na h√âireannaigh"; Ulster-Scots: "Airisch"
or "Airish fowk") are an ethnic group who originate in Ireland, an island in
northwestern Europe. Ireland has been populated for around 9,000 years
(according to archaeological studies, see Prehistoric Ireland). The Irish
people's earliest ancestors are recorded in legends ‚Äì they are claimed to be
descended from groups such as the Nemedians, Fomorians, Fir Bolg, Tuatha D√©
Danann and the Milesians. Lebor Gab√°la √ârenn, a book of Irish mythology tells
that Tuatha D√© Dananns were Scythian descendants. The main groups that
interacted with the Irish in the Middle Ages include the Picts, Scots, and the
Vikings. Due to this contact, Icelanders are noted for having some Irish
descent. The Anglo-Norman invasion of the High Middle Ages, the English
plantations and the subsequent English rule of the country introduced the
Normans and Flemish into Ireland. Welsh, Picts, Bretons, and small parties of
Gauls and even Anglo-Saxons are known in Ireland from much earlier times. There
have been many notable Irish people throughout history. The 6th century Irish
monk and missionary Columbanus is regarded as one of the "fathers of Europe",
followed by Kilian of W√ºrzburg and Vergilius of Salzburg. The scientist Robert
Boyle is considered the "father of chemistry". Famous Irish explorers include
Brendan the Navigator, Robert McClure, Ernest Shackleton and Tom Crean. By some
accounts, the first European child born in North America had Irish descent on
both sides; and an Irishman was the first European to set foot on American soil
in Columbus' expedition of 1492. Large populations of people of Irish ethnicity
live in many western countries, particularly in English-speaking countries.
Historically, emigration has been caused by politics, famine and economic
issues. An estimated 50 to 80 million people make up the Irish diaspora today,
which includes Great Britain, the United States, Australia, Canada, Argentina,
Chile, Jamaica, Trinidad, South Africa, New Zealand, Mexico, France, Germany
and Brazil. The largest number of people of Irish descent live in the United
States ‚Äì about ten times more than in Ireland itself. Origins and
antecedents. In its summary of their article 'Who were the Celts?' the National
Museum Wales note "It is possible that future genetic studies of ancient and
modern human DNA may help to inform our understanding of the subject. However,
early studies have, so far, tended to produce implausible conclusions from very
small numbers of people and using outdated assumptions about linguistics and
archaeology." Nineteenth century anthropology studied the physical
characteristics of Irish people in minute detail. Prehistoric and legendary
ancestors. During the past 8,000 years of inhabitation, Ireland has witnessed
many different peoples arrive on its shores. The ancient peoples of Ireland ‚Äî
such as the creators of the C√©ide Fields and Newgrange‚Äîare almost unknown.
Neither their languages nor terms they used to describe themselves have
survived. As late as the middle centuries of the 1st millennium the inhabitants
of Ireland did not appear to have a collective name for themselves. Ireland
itself was known by a number of different names, including Banba, F√≥dla, √âriu
by the islanders, "Iouerne" and "Hiverne" to the Greeks, and Hibernia to the
Romans. Scotland takes its name from Scoti/Scotti (singular Scotus/Scottus),
which is the Roman name for Celtic inhabitants of Caledonia (Scotland) and
Hibernia (Ireland). Other Latin names for people from Ireland in Classic and
Mediaeval sources include Attacotti and Gael. This last word, derived from the
Welsh "gwyddel" "raiders", was eventually adopted by the Irish for themselves.
However, as a term it is on a par with Viking, as it describes an activity
(raiding, piracy) and its proponents, not their actual ethnic affiliations. The
terms "Irish" and "Ireland" are derived from the goddess √âriu. A variety of
historical ethnic groups have inhabited the island, including the Airgialla,
Fir Ol nEchmacht, Delbhna, Fir Bolg, √ârainn, E√≥ganachta, Mairtine, Conmaicne,
Soghain, and Ulaid. In the cases of the Conmaicne, Delbhna, and perhaps
√ârainn, it can be demonstrated that the tribe took their name from their chief
deity, or in the case of the Ciannachta, E√≥ganachta, and possibly the Soghain,
a deified ancestor. This practise is paralleled by the Anglo-Saxon dynasties
claims of descent from Woden, via his sons Wecta, Baeldaeg, Casere and
Wihtlaeg. The Greek mythographer Euhemerus originated the concept of
Euhemerism, which treats mythological accounts as a reflection of actual
historical events shaped by retelling and traditional mores. In the 12th
century, Icelandic bard and historian Snorri Sturluson proposed that the Norse
gods were originally historical war leaders and kings, who later became cult
figures, eventually set into society as gods. This view is in agreement with
Irish historians such T. F. O'Rahilly and Francis John Byrne; the early
chapters of their respective books, "Early Irish history and mythology"
(reprinted 2004) and "Irish Kings and High-Kings" (3rd revised edition, 2001),
deal in depth with the origins and status of many Irish ancestral deities. One
legend states that the Irish were descended from one M√≠l Esp√°ine, whose sons
supposedly conquered Ireland around 1000 BC or later. The character is almost
certainly a mere personification of a supposed migration by a group or groups
from Iberia to Ireland. It is from this that the Irish were, as late as the
1800s, popularly known as "Milesian". Medieval Irish historians, over the
course of several centuries, created the genealogical dogma that all Irish were
descendants of M√≠l, ignoring the fact that their own works demonstrated
inhabitants in Ireland prior to his supposed arrival. This doctrine was adapted
between the 10th and 12th centuries, as demonstrated in the works of Eochaidh
Ua Floinn (936‚Äì1004); Flann Mainistrech (died 25 November 1056); Tanaide
(died c. 1075) and Gilla C√≥m√°in mac Gilla Samthainde (fl. 1072). Many of
their compositions were incorporated into the compendium Lebor Gab√°la √ârenn.
This tradition was enhanced and embedded in the tradition by successive
historians such as Dubs√∫ilech √ì Maolconaire (died 1270); Se√°n M√≥r √ì
Dubhag√°in (d.1372); Giolla √çosa M√≥r Mac Fir Bhisigh (fl. 1390‚Äì1418); Pilip
Ballach √ì Duibhgeann√°in (fl. 1579‚Äì1590) and Flann Mac Aodhag√°in (alive
1640). The first Irish historian who questioned the reliability of such
accounts was Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh (murdered 1671). Genetics. The
frequency of Y-DNA haplogroup R1b (the most common haplogroup in Europe) is
highest in the populations of Atlantic Europe and, due to European emigration,
in North America, South America, and Australia. In Ireland and the Basque
Country its frequency exceeds 90% and approaches 100% in Western Ireland. The
incidence of R1b is 70% or more in Celtic regions - Cumbria and Cornwall in
England, northern Iberia (Celtic - Galicia (Spain) and Basque Country ),
western France (Celtic - Brittany), and Celtic Countries - Wales and Scotland
in Britain. R1b's incidence declines gradually with distance from these areas
but it is still common across the central areas of Europe. R1b is the most
frequent haplogroup in Germany, and is common in southern Scandinavia and in
Italy. This led to writers, such as Stephen Oppenheimer and Bryan Sykes, to
conclude that the majority of Irish people (and indeed all natives of the
British Isles) primarily descend from an "Iberian refugium" population
bottleneck dating back to the last ice age. However, this haplogroup is now
believed by some to have originated over 12,000 years more recently than
previously thought. It thus follows that Irish and many other R1b subclades
will be considerably younger than the maximum age of 18,000 years. The previous
estimates, based on inaccurate dating methods (30,000+ years BP), made R1b and
its subclades seem to be more useful indicators of the paleolithic era
populations of western Europe than they actually are. According to recent 2009
studies by Bramanti et al. and Malmstr√∂m et al. on mtDNA, related western
European populations appear to be largely from the neolithic and not
paleolithic era, as previously thought. There was discontinuity between
mesolithic central Europe and modern European populations mainly due to an
extremely high frequency of haplogroup U (particularly U5) types in mesolithic
central European sites. That there exists an especially strong genetic
association between the Irish and the Basques, one even closer than the
relationship between other west Europeans, was first challenged in 2005, and in
2007 scientists began looking at the possibility of a more recent Mesolithic-
or even Neolithic-era entrance of R1b into Europe. A new study published in
2010 by Balaresque et al. implies either a Mesolithic- or Neolithic- (not
Paleolithic) era entrance of R1b into Europe. However, all these genetic
studies are in agreement that the Irish and Basque (along with the Welsh) share
the highest percentage of R1b populations. Although the Welsh have a greater
presumed Neolithic input than both the Irish and the Basques. Genetic marker
R1b averages from 83-89% amongst the Welsh. History. Early expansion and the
coming of Christianity. One Roman historian records that the Irish people were
divided into "sixteen different nations" or tribes. Traditional histories
assert that the Romans never attempted to conquer Ireland, although it may have
been considered. The Irish were not, however, cut off from Europe; they
frequently raided the Roman territories, and also maintained trade links.
Following the conversion of the Irish to Christianity, Irish secular laws and
social institutions remained in place. Migration and invasion in the Middle
Ages. Around the 5th century, Gaelic language and culture spread from Ireland
to what is now the west of Scotland via the D√°l Riata. These Gaels soon spread
out to most of the rest of the country. "Scoti" is the name given by the Romans
earlier in the millennium who encountered the inhabitants of Ireland. The
Gaelic cultural and linguistic dominance of northern Britain is the origin of
the name "Scotland". The territories of the Gaels and the Picts merged to form
the Kingdom of Alba. The modern Scottish people have therefore been influenced
historically by both the Irish people and the English people to the south. The
Isle of Man and the Manx people also came under massive Gaelic influence in
their history. Irish missionaries such as Saint Columba brought Christianity to
Pictish Scotland. The Irishmen of this time were also "aware of the cultural
unity of Europe", and it was the 6th century Irish monk Columbanus who is
regarded as "one of the fathers of Europe". Another Irish saint, Aidan of
Lindisfarne, has been proposed as a possible patron saint of the United
Kingdom, while Saints Kilian and Vergilius became the patron saints of
W√ºrzburg in Germany and Salzburg in Austria, respectively. Irish missionaries
founded monasteries outside Ireland, such as Iona Abbey, the Abbey of St Gall
in Switzerland, and Bobbio Abbey in Italy. Common to both the monastic and the
secular bardic schools were Irish and Latin. With Latin, the early Irish
scholars "show almost a like familiarity that they do with their own Gaelic".
There is evidence also that Hebrew and Greek were studied, the latter probably
being taught at Iona. Since the time of Charlemagne, Irish scholars had a
considerable presence in the Frankish court, where they were renowned for their
learning. The most significant Irish intellectual of the early monastic period
was the 9th century Johannes Scotus Eriugena, an outstanding philosopher in
terms of originality. He was the earliest of the founders of scholasticism, the
dominant school of medieval philosophy. He had considerable familiarity with
the Greek language, and translated many works into Latin, affording access to
the Cappadocian Fathers and the Greek theological tradition, previously almost
unknown in the Latin West. The influx of Viking raiders and traders in the 9th
and 10th centuries resulted in the founding of many of Ireland's most important
towns, including Cork, Dublin, Limerick, and Waterford (earlier Gaelic
settlements on these sites did not approach the urban nature of the subsequent
Norse trading ports). The Vikings left little impact on Ireland other than
towns and certain words added to the Irish language, but many Irish taken as
slaves inter-married with the Scandinavians, hence forming a close link with
the Icelandic people. In the Icelandic "Laxd≈ìla saga", for example, "even
slaves are highborn, descended from the kings of Ireland." The first name of
Nj√°ll √ûorgeirsson, the chief protagonist of "Nj√°ls saga", is a variation of
the Irish name Neil. According to "Eirik the Red's Saga", the first European
couple to have a child born in North America was descended from the Viking
Queen of Dublin, Aud the Deep-minded, and a Gaelic slave brought to Iceland.
The arrival of the Anglo-Normans brought also the Welsh, Flemish, Anglo-Saxons,
and Bretons. Most of these were assimilated into Irish culture and polity by
the 15th century, with the exception of some of the walled towns and the Pale
areas. The Late Middle Ages also saw the settlement of Scottish gallowglass
families of mixed Gaelic-Norse -Pict descent, mainly in the north; due to
similarities of language and culture they too were assimilated. Surnames. The
Irish were among the first people in Europe to use surnames as we know them
today. It is very common for people of Gaelic origin to have the English
versions of their surnames beginning with "O'" or "Mc" (less frequently "Mac"
and occasionally shortened to just "Ma" at the beginning of the name). "O'"
comes from the Gaelic √ì which in turn came from Ua, which means "grandson", or
"descendant" of a named person. Names that begin with "O'" include √ì Briain
(O'Brien), √ì Cheallaigh (O'Kelly), √ì Conchobhair (O'Connor), √ì Domhnaill
(O'Donnell), √ì Cuilinn (Cullen), √ì M√°ille (O'Malley), √ì N√©ill (O'Neill),
√ì S√© (O'Shea), √ì S√∫illeabh√°in (O'Sullivan), and √ì Tuathail (O'Toole).
"Mac" or "Mc" means "son". Names that begin with Mac or Mc include Mac Diarmada
(MacDermott), Mac C√°rthaigh (MacCarthy), Mac Domhnaill (MacDonnell), and Mac
Mathghamhna (MacMahon, MacMahony, etc.). Mac is commonly anglicised Mc.
However, "Mac" and "Mc" are not mutually exclusive, so, for example, both
"MacCarthy" and "McCarthy" are used. While both "Mac" and "O'" prefixes are
Gaelic in origin, "Mac" is more common in Scotland and in Ulster than in the
rest of Ireland; furthermore, "√ì" is far less common in Scotland than it is in
Ireland. The proper surname for a woman in Irish uses the feminine prefix nic
(meaning daughter) in place of mac. Thus a boy may be called Mac Domhnaill
whereas his sister would be called Nic Dhomhnaill or N√≠ Dhomhnaill - the
insertion of 'h' follows the female prefix in the case of most consonants (bar
H, L, N, R, & T). A son has the same surname as his father. A female's surname
replaces √ì with N√≠ (reduced from In√≠on U√≠ - "daughter of the grandson of")
and Mac with Nic (reduced from In√≠on Mhic - "daughter of the son of"); in both
cases the following name undergoes lenition. However, if the second part of the
surname begins with the letter C or G, it is not lenited after Nic. Thus the
daughter of a man named √ì Maolag√°in has the surname "N√≠ Mhaolag√°in" and the
daughter of a man named Mac Gearailt has the surname "Nic Gearailt". When
anglicised, the name can remain O' or Mac, regardless of gender. There are a
number of Irish surnames derived from Norse personal names, including Mac
Suibhne (Sweeney) from Swein and McAuliffe from "Olaf". The name Cotter, local
to County Cork, derives from the Norse personal name Ottir. The name Reynolds
is an Anglicization of the Gaelic Mac Raghnaill, itself originating from the
Norse names Randal or Reginald. Though these names were of Viking derivation
some of the families who bear them appear to have had Gaelic origins. "Fitz" is
an old Norman French variant of the Old French word "fils" (variant spellings
filz, fiuz, fiz, etc.), used by the Normans, meaning "son". The Normans
themselves were descendants of Vikings, who had settled in Normandy and
thoroughly adopted the French language and culture. With the exception of the
Gaelic-Irish Fitzpatrick (Mac Giolla Ph√°draig) surname, all names that begin
with Fitz ‚Äì including FitzGerald (Mac Gearailt), Fitzsimons (Mac S√≠om√≥in/
Mac an Ridire) and FitzHenry (Mac Anra√≠) ‚Äì are descended from the initial
Norman settlers. A small number of Irish families of Gaelic origin came to use
a Norman form of their original surname‚Äîso that Mac Giolla Ph√°draig became
Fitzpatrick ‚Äì while some assimilated so well that the Gaelic name was dropped
in favor of a new, Hiberno-Norman form. Another common Irish surname of Norman
Irish origin is the 'de' habitational prefix, meaning 'of' and originally
signifying prestige and land ownership. Examples include de B√∫rca (Burke), de
Br√∫n, de Barra (Barry), de Stac (Stack), de Ti√∫it, de Faoite (White), de
Londras (Landers), de Paor (Power). The Irish surname "Walsh" (in Gaelic
"Breathnach") was routinely given to settlers of Welsh origin, who had come
during and after the Norman invasion. The Joyce and Griffin/Griffith (Gruffydd)
families are also of Welsh origin. The Mac Lochlainn, √ì Maol Seachlainn, √ì
Maol Seachnaill, √ì Conchobhair Mac Loughlin and Mac Diarmada Mac Loughlin
families, all distinct, are now all subsumed together as MacLoughlin. The full
surname usually indicated which family was in question, something that has
being diminished with the loss of prefixes such as √ì and Mac. Different
branches of a family with the same surname sometimes used distinguishing
epithets, which sometimes became surnames in their own right. Hence the chief
of the clan √ì Cearnaigh (Kearney) was referred to as An Sionnach (Fox), which
his descendants use to this day. Similar surnames are often found in Scotland
for many reasons, such as the use of a common language and mass Irish migration
to Scotland in the late 19th and early to mid-20th centuries. Late Medieval and
Tudor Ireland. The Irish people of the Late Middle Ages were active as traders
on the European continent. They were distinguished from the English (who only
used their own language or French) in that they only used Latin abroad‚Äîa
language "spoken by all educated people throughout Gaeldom". According to the
writer Seumas MacManus, the explorer Christopher Columbus visited Ireland to
gather information about the lands to the west, a number of Irish names are
recorded on Columbus' crew roster preserved in the archives of Madrid and it
was an Irishman named Patrick Maguire who was the first to set foot in the
Americas in 1492; however, according to Morison and Miss Gould, who made a
detailed study of the crew list of 1492, no Irish or English sailors were
involved in the voyage. Another English commentator records that the assemblies
were attended by "all the scum of the country"‚Äîthe labouring population as
well as the landowners. While the distinction between "free" and "unfree"
elements of the Irish people was unreal in legal terms, it was a social and
economic reality. Social mobility was usually downwards, due to social and
economic pressures. The ruling clan's "expansion from the top downwards" was
constantly displacing commoners and forcing them into the margins of society.
As a clan-based society, genealogy was all important. Ireland 'was justly
styled a "Nation of Annalists"'. The various branches of Irish
learning‚Äîincluding law, poetry, history and genealogy, and medicine‚Äîwere
associated with hereditary learned families. The poetic families included the
U√≠ Dh√°laigh (Daly) and the MacGrath. Irish physicians, such as the O'Briens
in Munster or the MacCailim Mor in the Western Isles, were renowned in the
courts of England, Spain, Portugal and the Low Countries. Learning was not
exclusive to the hereditary learned families, however; one such example is
Cathal Mac Manus, the 15th century diocesan priest who wrote the "Annals of
Ulster". Other learned families included the Mic Aodhag√°in and Clann Fhir
Bhisigh. It was this latter family which produced Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh,
the 17th century genealogist and compiler of the "Leabhar na nGenealach". (see
also Irish medical families). Plantations. After Ireland was subdued by
England, the English‚Äîunder James I of England (reigned 1603‚Äì1625), the Lord
Protector Oliver Cromwell (1653‚Äì1658), William III of England (reigned
1689‚Äì1702) and their successors‚Äîbegan the settling of Protestant Scottish
and English colonists into Ireland, where they settled most heavily in the
northern province of Ulster. The Plantations of Ireland, and in particular the
Plantation of Ulster in the 17th century, introduced great numbers of Scottish,
English as well as French Huguenots as colonists. Many Gaelic Irish were
displaced during the 17th century plantations. Only in the major part of Ulster
did the plantations of mostly Scottish prove long-lived; the other three
provinces (Connacht, Leinster, and Munster) remained heavily Gaelic Irish.
Eventually, the Anglo-Irish and Protestant populations of those three provinces
decreased drastically as a result of the political developments in the early
20th century in Ireland, as well as the Catholic Church's Ne Temere decree for
mixed marriages, which obliged the non-Catholic partner to have the children
raised as Catholics. Enlightenment Ireland. There have been notable Irish
scientists. The Anglo-Irish scientist Robert Boyle (1627‚Äì1691) is considered
the father of chemistry for his book "The Sceptical Chymist", written in 1661.
Boyle was an atomist, and is best known for Boyle's Law. The hydrographer Rear
Admiral Francis Beaufort (1774‚Äì1857), an Irish naval officer of Huguenot
descent, was the creator of the Beaufort scale for indicating wind force.
George Boole (1815‚Äì1864), the mathematician who invented Boolean algebra,
spent the latter part of his life in Cork. The 19th century physicist George
Stoney introduced the idea and the name of the electron. He was the uncle of
another notable physicist, George FitzGerald. The Irish bardic system, along
with the Gaelic culture and learned classes, were upset by the plantations, and
went into decline. Among the last of the true bardic poets were Brian Mac
Giolla Ph√°draig (c. 1580‚Äì1652) and D√°ibh√≠ √ì Bruadair (1625‚Äì1698). The
Irish poets of the late 17th and 18th centuries moved toward more modern
dialects. Among the most prominent of this period were S√©amas Dall Mac Cuarta,
Peadar √ì Doirn√≠n, Art Mac Cumhaigh, Cathal Bu√≠ Mac Giolla Ghunna, and Se√°n
Cl√°rach Mac Domhnaill. Irish Catholics continued to receive an education in
secret "hedgeschools", in spite of the Penal laws. A knowledge of Latin was
common among the poor Irish mountaineers in the 17th century, who spoke it on
special occasions, while cattle were bought and sold in Greek in the mountain
market-places of Kerry. For a comparatively small population of about 6 million
people, Ireland made an enormous contribution to literature during the
enlightenment. Irish literature encompasses the Irish and English languages.
Notable Irish writers include Jonathan Swift (1667‚Äì1745), Laurence Sterne,
Oliver Goldsmith, and Bram Stoker. 20th century. In 1921, with the formation of
the Irish Free State, six counties in the northeast remained in the United
Kingdom as Northern Ireland. It is predominately religion, historical, and
political differences that divide the two communities of (nationalism and
unionism). Four polls taken between 1989 and 1994 revealed that when asked to
state their national identity, over 79% of Northern Irish Protestants replied
"British" or "Ulster" with 3% or less replying "Irish", while over 60% of
Northern Irish Catholics replied "Irish" with 13% or less replying "British" or
"Ulster". A survey in 1999 showed that 72% of Northern Irish Protestants
considered themselves "British" and 2% "Irish", with 68% of Northern Irish
Catholics considering themselves "Irish" and 9% "British". The survey also
revealed that 78% of Protestants and 48% of all respondents felt "Strongly
British", while 77% of Catholics and 35% of all respondents felt "Strongly
Irish". 51% of Protestants and 33% of all respondents felt "Not at all Irish",
while 62% of Catholics and 28% of all respondents felt "Not at all British".
Surnames in the nine-county Province of Ulster tend to differ based on which
community families originate from. Ulster Protestants tend to have either
English or Scottish surnames while Catholics tend to have Irish surnames,
although this is not always the case. There are many Catholics in nine-county
Ulster with surnames such as Adams, Emerson, Whitson, Livingstone, Hardy,
Tennyson, Galbraith, McCausland, MacDonald (this surname is also common with
Highland Roman Catholics in Scotland), Dunbar, Groves, Legge, Scott, Gray,
Page, Stewart, Roberts, Rowntree, Henderson, et al., due to intermarriage.
Recent history. Religions. In the Republic of Ireland, as of 2006, 3,681,446
people or about 86.83% of the population claim to be Roman Catholic. In
Northern Ireland about 53.1% of the population are Protestant (21.1%
Presbyterian, 15.5% Church of Ireland, 3.6% Methodist, 6.1% Other Christian)
whilst a large minority are Catholic at approximately 43.8%, as of 2001. This
has been a matter of concern over the last century for followers of nationalist
ideologists such as DP Moran. Irish Identity. The question of Irish identity,
and what defines Irishness, was elucidated by the prominent Irish nationalist
Thomas Davis: The question of 'Irishness' is also examined in the Irish
language film Yu Ming Is Ainm Dom in which a Chinese man learns the Irish
language before visiting Ireland, only to find no one understands him upon his
arrival in Dublin. This would also be a classic case of being More Irish than
the Irish themselves. Europe. Ireland joined the European Community in 1973,
and Irish citizens became additionally Citizens of the European Union with the
Maastricht Treaty signed in 1992. This brought a further question for the
future of Irish identity; whether Ireland was "closer to Boston than to Berlin:
" Celebrities. Ireland is well known for producing a wealth of famous figures
in the arts and media. A number of important figures in science and technology
and business have also come from Ireland. Irish diaspora. The Irish diaspora
consists of Irish emigrants and their descendants in countries such as the
United States, Great Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and
nations of the Caribbean such as Jamaica and Barbados. These countries, known
sometimes as the Anglosphere, all have large minorities of Irish descent, who
in addition form the core of the Catholic Church in those countries. People of
Irish descent also feature strongly in Latin America, especially in Argentina
and important minorities in Brazil, Chile, and Mexico. In 1995, President Mary
Robinson reached out to the "70¬ million people worldwide who can claim Irish
descent." Today the diaspora is believed to contain an estimated 80 million
people. There are also large Irish communities in some mainland European
countries, notably in Spain, France and Germany. Between 1585 and 1818, over
half a million Irish departed Ireland to serve in the wars on the continent, in
a constant emigration romantically styled the ""Flight of the Wild Geese"". In
the early years of the English Civil War, a French traveller remarked that the
Irish "are better soldiers abroad than at home". Later, Irish brigades in
France and Spain fought in the Wars of the Spanish and Austrian Succession and
the Napoleonic Wars. In the words of Arthur Wellesley, the Irish-born "Iron
Duke" of Wellington, a notable representative of the Irish military diaspora,
"Ireland was an inexhaustible nursery for the finest soldiers". The most famous
cause of emigration was the Great Famine of the late 1840s. A million are
thought to have emigrated to Liverpool as a result of the famine. For both the
Irish in Ireland and those in the resulting diaspora, the famine entered folk
memory and became a rallying point for various nationalist movements. People of
Irish descent are the second largest self-reported ethnic group in the United
States, after German Americans. Nine of the signatories of the American
Declaration of Independence were of Irish origin. Among them was the sole
Catholic signatory, Charles Carroll of Carrollton, whose family were the
descendants of Ely O'Carroll, an Irish prince who had suffered under Cromwell.
At least twenty-five presidents of the United States have some Irish ancestral
origins, including George Washington. Since John F. Kennedy took office in
1961, every American President has had some Irish blood. An Irish-American,
James Hoban, was the designer of the White House. Commodore John Barry was the
father of the United States Navy. In the mid-19th century, large numbers of
Irish immigrants were conscripted into Irish regiments of the United States
Army at the time of the Mexican-American War. The vast majority of the 4,811
Irish-born soldiers served in the U.S. Army, but some defected to the Mexican
Army, primarily to escape mistreatment by Anglo-Protestant officers and the
strong anti-Catholic discrimination in America. These were the "San Patricios",
or Saint Patrick's Battalion‚Äîa group of Irish led by Galway-born John
O'Riley, with some German, Scottish and American Catholics. They fought until
their surrender at the decisive Battle of Churubusco, and were executed outside
Mexico City by the American government on 13 September 1847. The battalion is
commemorated in Mexico each year on 12 September. During the 18th and 19th
centuries, 300,000 free emigrants and 45,000 convicts left Ireland to settle in
Australia. Today, Australians of Irish descent are one of the largest self-
reported ethnic groups in Australia, after English and Australian. In the 2006
Census, 1,803,741 residents identified themselves as having Irish ancestry
either alone or in combination with another ancestry. However this figure does
not include Australians with an Irish background who chose to nominate
themselves as 'Australian' or other ancestries. The Australian embassy in
Dublin states that up to 30 percent of the population claim some degree of
Irish ancestry. It is believed that as many as 30,000 Irish people emigrated to
Argentina between the 1830s and the 1890s. Today Irish-Argentines number over
1,000,000‚Äîabout 1.25% of the population. Some famous Argentines of Irish
descent include Che Guevara, former president Edelmiro Juli√°n Farrell, and
admiral William Brown. There are people of Irish descent all over South
America, such as the Chilean liberator Bernardo O'Higgins and the Peruvian
photographer Mario Testino. Although some Irish retained their surnames intact,
others were assimilated into the Spanish vernacular. The last name "O'Brien",
for example, became "Obreg√≥n". People of Irish descent are also one of the
largest self-reported ethnic groups in Canada, after English, French and
Scottish Canadians. As of 2006, Irish Canadians number around 4,354,155.
