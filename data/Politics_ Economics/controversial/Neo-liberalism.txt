Neoliberalism The term Neoliberalism is most commonly used to refer to economic
liberalizations, free trade and open markets, privatization, deregulation, and
enhancing the role of the private sector in modern society. Today the term is
mostly used as a general condemnation of economic liberalization policies and
its advocates. The term was introduced in the late thirties by European liberal
intellectuals to promote a new form of liberalism after interest in classical
liberalism had declined in Europe. In the decades that followed, neoliberal
theory tended to be at variance with the more laissez-faire doctrine of
classical liberalism and promoted instead a market economy under the guidance
and rules of a strong state, a model which came to be known as the social
market economy. In the sixties, usage of the term "neoliberal" heavily
declined. When the term was reintroduced in the following decades, the meaning
had shifted. The term neoliberal is now normally associated with laissez-faire
economic policies, and is used mainly by those who are critical of market
reform. Terminology. The term "neoliberalism" was originally coined in 1938 by
the German scholar Alexander R√ºstow at the Colloque Walter Lippmann. The
colloquium defined the concept of neoliberalism as ‚Äúthe priority of the price
mechanism, the free enterprise, the system of competition and a strong and
impartial state.‚Äù To be ‚Äúneoliberal‚Äù meant that - in the name of
liberalism - a modern economic policy is required. Neoliberalism was not a
monolithic theory. At the outset it drew on different academic approaches such
as the Freiburg school, the Austrian School, the Chicago school of economics,
and Lippmann¬¥s realism. During the military rule under Augusto Pinochet (1973-
1990) in Chile, opposition scholars took up the expression again without a
specific reference to any theoretical revision of liberalism. Rather, it
described a set of political and economic reforms being implemented in Chile
and imbued the term with pejorative connotations. In the last two decades,
according to the Boas and Gans-Morse study of 148 journal articles,
neoliberalism is almost never defined but used in several senses to describe
ideology, economic theory, development theory, or economic reform policy. It
has largely become a term of condemnation employed by critics of liberalizing
economic tendencies. And it now suggests a market fundamentalism closer to the
laissez-faire principles of the ‚Äúpaleoliberals‚Äù than to the ideas of the
original neoliberals who attended the colloquium. This leaves some controversy
as to the precise meaning of the term and its usefulness as a descriptor in the
social sciences, especially as the number of different kinds of market
economies have proliferated in recent years. According to Boas and Gans-Morse
nowadays the most common use of the term neoliberalism refers to economic
reform policies such as ‚Äúeliminating price controls, deregulating capital
markets and lowering trade barriers‚Äù, and reducing state influence on the
economy especially by privatization and fiscal austerity. The term is used in
several senses: as a development model it refers to the rejection of
structuralist economics in favor of the Washington Consensus; as an ideology
the term is used to denote a conception of freedom as an overarching social
value associated with reducing state functions to those of a minimal state; and
finally as an academic paradigm the term is closely related to neoclassical
economic theory. Early History. Colloque Walter Lippmann. In the 1930s the mood
was decidedly anti-liberal. To join forces a group of 25 liberals organised the
Walter Lippman Colloquium, an international meeting that took place in Paris in
August 1938. Among them were Louis Rougier, Walter Lippmann, Friedrich Hayek,
Ludwig von Mises, Wilhelm R√∂pke and Alexander R√ºstow. Following the core
message of Lippmann‚Äôs book "The Good Society" participants like R√ºstow,
Lippmann and Rougier agreed that the old liberalism of laissez faire had failed
and that a new liberalism needed to take its place. While for them it was a
farewell to classical liberalism, which they thought to have failed, other
participants like Mises and Hayek were not convinced to condemn the old
liberalism of laissez faire. But all participants were united in their call for
a new liberal project. Following R√ºstow‚Äôs original recommendation they
called this project neoliberalism. The neoliberalism that came out of the
Colloque Walter Lippmann was generally in line with R√ºstow‚Äôs theories of
turning away from conceptions of unrestricted liberty towards a market economy
under the guidance and the rules of a strong state. It was an attempt to
formulate an anti-capitalist, anti-communist Third Way. Neoliberalism was
originally established as something quite different from the free market
radicalism with which it is usually associated today. At the Colloque Walter
Lippmann, the differences between ‚Äòtrue neoliberals‚Äô around R√ºstow and
Lippmann on the one hand and old school liberals around Mises and Hayek on the
other were already quite visible. There occurred fundamental differences. While
‚Äòtrue neoliberals‚Äô demanded state intervention to correct undesirable
market structures, Mises had always insisted that the only legitimate role for
the state was to abolish barriers to market entry. Similar differences of
opinion also existed in other questions such as social policy and the scope for
interventionism. After a few years the insurmountable differences between old
liberals and the neoliberals become unbearable. R√ºstow was bitter that Mises
still adhered to a version of liberalism that R√ºstow thought had failed
spectacularly. In a letter R√ºstow wrote that Hayek and his master Mises
deserved to be put in spirits and placed in a museum as one of the last
surviving specimen of the extinct species of liberals which caused the current
catastrophe (the Great Depression). Ludwig von Mises became equally critical of
the german neoliberals. He complained that Ordoliberalism really meant ‚Äòordo-
interventionism‚Äô. Mont Pelerin Society. The Mont Pelerin Society was founded
in 1947 by Friedrich Hayek to bring together the widely scattered neoliberal
thinkers and political figures. "Hayek and others believed that classical
liberalism had failed because of crippling conceptual flaws and that the only
way to diagnose and rectify them was to withdraw into an intensive discussion
group of similarly minded intellectuals." With central planning in the
ascendancy world-wide and with few avenues to influence policymakers, the
society served to bring together isolated advocates of liberalism as a
‚Äúrallying point‚Äù‚Äîas Milton Friedman phrased it. Meeting annually, it
would soon be a ‚Äúkind of international ‚Äòwho‚Äôs who‚Äô of the classical
liberal and neo-liberal intellectuals.‚Äù While the first conference in 1947
was almost half American, the Europeans concentration dominated by 1951. Europe
would remain the ‚Äúepicenter‚Äù of the community with Europeans dominating the
leadership. Post-WWII neo-liberal currents. Chicago School. The Chicago school
of economics describes a neoclassical school of thought within the academic
community of economists, with a strong focus around the faculty of University
of Chicago. The school emphasizes non-intervention from government and
generally rejects regulation in markets as inefficient with the exception of
central bank regulation of the money supply (i.e. monetarism). It is associated
with neoclassical price theory and libertarianism and the rejection of
Keynesianism in favor of monetarism until the 1980s, when it turned to rational
expectations. The school has impacted the field of finance by the development
of the efficient market hypothesis. In terms of methodology the stress is on
"positive economics"‚Äì that is, empirically based studies using statistics to
prove theory. Approximately 70% of the professors in the economics department
have been considered part of the school of thought. The University of Chicago
department, widely considered one of the world‚Äôs foremost economics
departments, has fielded more Nobel Prize winners and John Bates Clark
medalists in economics than any other university. Those who attend to the
Chicago School prefer some form of competition law, school vouchers,
intellectual property and prefer Milton Friedman's negative income tax as a
replacement to the existing system. Germany. In West Germany neoliberal ideas
were first implemented. The neoliberal economists around Ludwig Erhard could
draw on the theories they had developed in the 1930s and 1940s and contribute
to West Germany‚Äôs reconstruction after the Second World War. Erhard was a
member of the Mont Pelerin Society and in constant contact with other
neoliberals. He pointed out that he is commonly classified as neoliberal and
that he accepts this classification. Erhard wrote, ‚ÄúI would like to frankly
acknowledge that my own contribution to this effort social market economy--R.
P. would not have been possible without Walter Eucken, Franz Bohm, Wilhem
Ropke, Alexander Rustow, F. A. von Hayek, Alfred Muller-Armack, and many others
who joined me in thinking and debating‚Äù. The ordoliberal Freiburg School was
rather moderate and pragmatic. The German neoliberals accepted the classical
liberal notion that competition drives economic prosperity, but they argued
that a laissez-faire state policy stifles competition as the strong devour the
weak since monopolies and cartels could pose a threat to freedom of
competition. They supported the creation of a well-developed legal system and
capable regulatory apparatus. While still opposed to full-scale Keynesian
employment policies or an extensive welfare state German neoliberals‚Äô theory
was marked by their willingness to place humanistic and social values on par
with economic efficiency. Alfred M√ºller-Armack coined the phrase ‚Äúsocial
market economy‚Äù to emphasize the egalitarian and humanistic bent of the idea.
According to Taylor C. Boas and Jordan Gans-Morse Walter Eucken stated that
‚Äúsocial security and social justice are the greatest concerns of our time‚Äù.
Erhard had always emphasized that the market was inherently social and did not
need to be made so. He had hoped that growing prosperity would enable the
population to manage much of their social security by self-reliance and end the
necessity for a widespread welfare state. By the name of "Volkskapitalismus"
there were some efforts to foster private savings. But although average
contributions to the public old age insurance were quite small, it remained by
far the most important old age income source for a majority of the German
population. Therefore, despite liberal rhetoric, the 1950s witnessed what has
been called a ‚Ä≥reluctant expansion of the welfare state‚Ä≥. To end widespread
poverty among the elderly the pension reform of 1957 brought a significant
extension of the German welfare state which already had been established under
Otto von Bismarck. R√ºstow, who had coined the label ‚Äúneoliberalism‚Äù,
criticized that development tendency and pressed for a more limited welfare
programs. Hayek did not like the expression ‚Äúsocial market economy‚Äù, but he
noticed in 1976 that some of his friends in Germany had succeeded in
implementing the sort of social order for which he was pleading while using
that phrase. Ludwig von Mises stated despite some controversy at the Mont
Pelerin Society that Erhard and M√ºller-Armack accomplished a great act of
liberalism to restore the German economy and called this ‚Äúa lesson for the
US‚Äù. According to different research, however, Mises believed that the
Ordoliberals were hardly better than socialists. As an answer to Hans Hellwigs
complaints about the interventionist excesses of the Erhard ministry and the
Ordoliberals, Mises wrote, ‚ÄúI have no illusions about the true character of
the politics and politicians of the social market economy.‚Äù According to
Mises, Erhard¬¥s teacher Franz Oppenheimer ‚Äútaught more or less the New
Frontier line of‚Äù President Kennedy¬¥s ‚ÄúHarvard consultants (Schlesinger,
Galbraith, etc.)‚Äù Chile. In the 1960s Latin American intellectuals began to
notice the ideas of ordoliberalism; these intellectuals often used the Spanish
term neoliberalismo to refer to this school of thought. They were particularly
impressed by the social market economy and the Wirtschaftswunder (‚ÄúGerman
miracle‚Äù) and speculated about the possibility of accomplishing similar
policies in their own countries. Neoliberalism in 1960s meant essentially a
philosophy that was more moderate than classical liberalism and favored using
state policy to temper social inequality and counter a tendency toward
monopoly. In 1955 a select group of Chilean students (later known as the
Chicago Boys) were invited to the University of Chicago to pursue postgraduate
studies in economics. They worked directly under Friedman and his disciple
Arnold Harberger, while also being exposed to Hayek. When they returned to
Chile in the 1960s, the Chicago Boys began a concerted effort to spread the
philosophy and policy recommendations of the Chicago and Austrian schools,
setting up think tanks and publishing in ideologically sympathetic media. Under
the military dictatorship headed by Pinochet and severe social repression, the
Chicago boys implemented economic reform. The latter half of the 1970s
witnessed rapid and extensive privatization, deregulation, and reductions in
trade barriers. In 1978 policies that would reduce the role of the state and
infuse competition and individualism into areas such as labor relations,
pensions, health, and education were introduced. In 1990 the military
dictatorship ended. Hayek argued that increased economic freedom had put
pressure on the dictatorship over time and increased political freedom. Many
years earlier, in "The Road to Serfdom" (1944), Hayek had argued that "economic
control is not merely control of a sector of human life which can be separated
from the rest; it is the control of the means for all our ends." Two decades
after it was first used by pro-market intellectuals in the 1960s, the meaning
of neoliberalism changed. Those who regularly used the term neoliberalism in
the 1980s typically applied it in its present-day, radical sense, denoting
market fundamentalism. Neoliberalism had not only become a term with negative
connotations employed principally by critics of market reform, but it also had
shifted in meaning from a moderate form of liberalism to a more radical and
economically libertarian set of ideas. Scholars during this period had also
ceased to identify the Germans as neoliberalism‚Äôs intellectual progenitors,
tending instead to associate neoliberalism with the theories of Friedrich Hayek
and Milton Friedman. Indeed, Pinochet‚Äôs 1973 coup emerges as some kind of a
watershed in the usage of neoliberalism. Neoliberalism gained a negative,
radical sense just after this date. Once the new meaning of neoliberalism was
established as a common usage among Spanish-speaking scholars, it diffused
directly into the English-language study of political economy. Australia. In
Australia, neoliberal economic policies have been embraced by governments of
both the Labor Party and the Liberal Party since the 1980s. The governments of
Bob Hawke and Paul Keating from 1983 to 1996 pursued economic liberalisation
and a program of micro-economic reform. These governments privatized government
corporations , deregulated factor markets, floated the Australian dollar, and
reduced trade protection. Keating, as federal treasurer, implemented a
compulsory superannuation guarantee system in 1992 to increase national savings
and reduce future government liability for old age pensions. The financing of
universities was deregulated, requiring students to contribute to university
fees through a repayable loan system known as the Higher Education Contribution
Scheme (HECS) and encouraging universities to increase income by admitting
full-fee-paying students, including foreign students. The admitting of domestic
full fee paying students to public universities was stopped in 2009 by the Rudd
Labor Government. Expanded Definition. The meaning of neoliberalism has changed
over time and come to mean different things to different groups. As a result,
it is very hard to define. This is seen by the fact that authoritative sources
on neoliberalism, such as Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman, David Harvey and
Noam Chomsky do not agree about the meaning of neoliberalism. This lack of
agreement creates major problems in creating an unbiased and unambiguous
definition of neoliberalism. This section aims to define neoliberalism more
accurately and to show how its evolution has influenced the different uses of
the word. One of the first problems with the meaning of neoliberalism is that
liberalism, on which it is based, is also very hard to describe. The
uncertainty over the meaning of liberalism is commonly reflected in
neoliberalism itself, and is the first serious point of confusion. The second
major problem with the meaning of neoliberalism is that neoliberalism went from
being a purely theoretical ideology to become a practical and applied one. The
1970s onwards saw a surge in the acceptability of neoliberalism, and neoliberal
governments swept in across the world, promising neoliberal reforms. However,
governments did not always carry out their promised reforms, either through
design or circumstances. This leads to the second serious point of confusion;
namely, that most neoliberalism after this point isn't always ideologically
neoliberal. Classical Neoliberalism. The first form of neoliberalism, classical
neoliberalism, stems from classical liberalism and was chiefly created in
inter-War Austria by economists, including Friedrich Hayek and Ludwig von
Mises. They were concerned about the erosion of liberty by both socialist and
fascist governments in Europe at that time and tried to restate the case for
liberty which became the basis for neoliberalism. Hayek's 1970s book, "The
Constitution of Liberty" sums up this argument. In the introduction he states:
"If old truths are to retain their hold on men's minds, they must be restated
in the language and concepts of successive generations". Hayek's belief in
liberty stemmed from an argument about information. He believed that no
individual (or group, including the government) could ever understand
everything about an economy or a society in order to rationally design the best
system of governance. He argued this only got worse as scientific progress
increased and the scope of human knowledge grew, leaving individuals
increasingly more and more ignorant in their lifetimes. As a result, he
believed it was impossible for any person or government to design the perfect
systems under which people could be governed. The only solution to this, he
believed, was to allow all possible systems to be tried in the real world and
to allow the best systems to beat the worse systems through competition. In a
liberal society, he believed, the few who used liberty to try out new things
would come up with successful adaptations of existing systems or new ways of
doing things. These discoveries, once shared and become mainstream, would
benefit the whole of society, even those who did not directly partake of
liberty. Due to the ignorance of the individual, Hayek argued that an
individual could not understand which of the various political, economic and
social rules they had followed had made them successful. In his mind, this made
the superstitions and traditions of a society in which an individual operated
vitally important, since in probability they had, in some way, aided the
success of the individual. This would be especially true in a successful
society, where these superstitions and traditions would, in all probability be
successful ones that had evolved over time to exploit new circumstances.
However, this did not excuse any superstition or tradition being followed if it
had outlived it usefulness: respect of tradition and superstition for the sake
of tradition and superstition were not acceptable values to him. Therefore
classical neoliberalism combined a respect for the old, drawn from
conservatism, with the progressive striving towards the future, of liberalism.
In emphasising evolution and competition of ideas, Hayek highlighted the divide
between practical liberalism that evolved in a haphazard way in England,
championed by such people as David Hume and Adam Smith, versus the more
theoretical approach of the French, in such people as Descartes and Rousseau.
Hayek christened these the pragmatic and rationalist schools, the former
evolving institutions with an eye towards liberty and the later creating a
brave new world by sweeping all the old and therefore useless ideas away.
Hayeks's ideas on information and the necessity of evolving evolutions placed
neoliberalism firmly on the pragmatic side against both rationalist socialists
(such as communists, fascism and social liberals) and rationalist capitalists
(such as economic libertarians, laissez-faire capitalists) alike. The Rule of
Law. At the centre of neoliberalism was the rule of law. Hayek believed that
liberty was maximised when coercion was minimised. Hayek did not believe that a
complete lack of coercion was possible, or even desirable, for a liberal
society, and he argued that a set of traditions was absolutely necessary which
allowed individuals to judge whether they would or would not be coerced. This
body of tradition he notes as law and the use of this tradition and the Rule of
Law. In designing a liberal system of law, Hayek believed that two things were
vitally important: the protection and delineation of the personal sphere and
the prevention of fraud and deception, which could be maintained only by threat
of coercion from the state. In delineating a personal sphere, individuals could
know under what circumstances they would or would not be coerced under, and
could make plans for the use of their resources in achieving their aims. In
designing such a system, Hayek believed that it could maintain a protected
sphere by protecting against abuses by the ruling power, be it a monarch (e.g.
Bill of Rights 1689), the will of the majority in a democracy (e.g. the US
Constitution) or the administration (e.g. the Rechtsstaat). He believed that
the most important features of such protections were equality before the law,
and generality of the law. Equality meant that all should be equal before the
law and therefore subject to it, even those decisions of a legislature or
government administration. Generality meant that the law should be general and
abstract, focusing not on ends or means, as a command would, but on general
rules which, by their lack of specificity, could not be said to grant
privileges, discriminate or compel any specific individual to an end. General
laws could also be used to transmit knowledge and encourage spontaneous order
in human societies (much like the use of Adam Smith's invisible hand in
economics). He also stressed the importance of individuals being responsible
for their actions in order to encourage others to respect the law. Policy.
Important practical tools for making these things work included separation of
powers, the idea that those enforcing the law and those making it should be
separate, to prevent the lawmakers from pursuing short-term ends and
constitutionalism, the idea that lawmakers should be legally bound about the
laws they could pass, thereby preventing absolute rule by the majority. In the
1980s, a practical statement of neoliberal aims was codified in the Washington
Consensus. Conservatism. Classical neoliberalism's respect for tradition,
combined with its pragmatic approach to progress, endeared it to conservative
movements around the world looking for a way to adapt to the changing nature of
the modern world. This saw it adopted by conservative movements, most famously
in Chile under Pinochet, the United Kingdom under Margaret Thatcher and in the
United States of America under Ronald Reagan. Economic Neoliberalism. The next
important form of neoliberalism is economic neoliberalism. Economic
neoliberalism stems out of the historical rift between classical liberalism and
economic liberalism, and developed when the economically liberal minded co-
opted the language and ideas of classical neoliberalism to place economic
freedom at its heart, making it a right-wing ideology. Essentially, economic
neoliberalism can be derived by taking the classical neoliberal definition
above and taking the protected personal sphere to solely refer to property
rights and contract. The liberal opposite of economic neoliberalism is modern
liberalism, the corresponding left-wing ideology. The best known proponent of
economic neoliberalism is Milton Friedman. Economic neoliberalism is the most
common form of neoliberalism, and is what is usually meant when a system is
described as neoliberal. Economic neoliberalism is distinct from classical
neoliberalism for many reasons. Hayek believed that certain elements that now
make up modern economic neoliberal thought are too rationalist, relying on
preconceived notions of human behaviour, such as the idea of homo economicus.
Paul Treanor points out that it is too utopian, and therefore illiberal. David
Harvey points out that economic neoliberalism is "theory of economic political
practices", rather than a complete ideology, and therefore, no correlation or
connection needs to exist between a favourable assessment of neoliberal
economic practises and a commitment to liberalism proper. Likewise Anna-Maria
Blomgren views neoliberalism as a continuum ranging from classical to economic
liberalism. A broad and, it is hoped, clearer restatement of the above is to
point out that classic liberals must be economic liberals, but economic
liberals do not have to be classically liberal, and it is the latter group that
makes up the "new liberalism" of economic neoliberalism. Neoliberal Economics.
Friedman's chief argument about neoliberalism can be described as a
consequentialist libertarian one: that the reason for adopting minimal
government interference in the economy is for its beneficial consequences, and
not any ideological reason. At the heart of economic neoliberalism are various
theories that prove the economic neoliberal ideology. Neoliberal economics in
the 1920s took the ideas of the great liberal economists, such as Adam Smith,
and updated them for the modern world. Friedrich Hayek's ideas on information
flow, present in classical neoliberalism, were codified in economic form under
the Austrian School as the economic calculation problem. This problem of
information flow implied that a decentralised system, in which information
travelled freely and was freely determined at each localised point (Hayek
called this catallaxy), would be much better than a central authority trying to
do the same, even if it was completely efficient and was motivated to act in
the public good. In this view, the free market is a perfect example of such a
system in which the market determined prices act as the information signals
flowing through the economy. Actors in the economy could make decent decisions
for their own businesses factoring in all the complex factors that led to
market prices without having to understand or be completely aware of all of
those complex factors. In accepting the ideas of the Austrian School regarding
information flow, economic neoliberals were forced to accept that free markets
were artificial, and therefore would not arise spontaneously, but would have to
be enforced, usually through the state and the rule of law. In this way,
economic neoliberalism enshrines the role of the state and becomes distinct
from libertarian thought. However, in accepting the ideas of self-regulating
markets, neoliberals drastically restrict the role of the government to
managing those forms of market failure that the neoliberal economics allowed:
property rights and information asymmetry. This restricted the government to
maintaining property rights by providing law and order through the police,
maintaining an independent judiciary and maintaining the national defence, and
basic regulation to guard against fraud. This made neoliberal economics
distinct from Keynesian economics of the preceding decades. These ideas were
then developed further. Milton Friedman introduced the idea of adaptive
expectations during the stagflation of the 1970s, which described why
government interference (in the form of printing money) resulted in increasing
inflation, as shop owners started to predict the rate of increase in the money
supply, rendering the government action useless. This developed into the idea
of rational expectations, which showed that all government interference useless
and disruptive because the free market would predict and undermine the
government's proposed action. At the same time, the efficient market hypothesis
assumed that, because of catallaxy, the market could not be informationally
wrong. Or, to paraphrase the famous quote of Warren Buffett, "the market is
there to inform you, not serve you". Combined with rational expectations, this
showed that markets would be self-regulating, and that regulation was
unnecessary and disruptive. Additionally, many theories were developed which
showed that the free market would produce the socially optimum equilibrium with
regard to production of goods and services, such as the fundamental theorems of
welfare economics and general equilibrium theory, which helped prove further
that government intervention could only result in making society worse off (see
Pareto efficient). Philosophical Neoliberalism. David Harvey, A Brief History
of Neoliberalism, Oxford University Press "As you would expect from a complete
philosophy, neoliberalism has answers to stereotypical philosophical questions
such as "Why are we here" and "What should I do?". We are here for the market,
and you should compete. Neo-liberals tend to believe that humans exist for the
market, and not the other way around: certainly in the sense that it is good to
participate in the market, and that those who do not participate have failed in
some way. In personal ethics, the general neoliberal vision is that every human
being is an entrepreneur managing their own life, and should act as such. Moral
philosophers call this is a virtue ethic, where human beings compare their
actions to the way an ideal type would act - in this case the ideal
entrepreneur. Individuals who choose their friends, hobbies, sports, and
partners, to maximise their status with future employers, are ethically
neoliberal. This attitude - not unusual among ambitious students - is unknown
in any pre-existing moral philosophy, and is absent from early liberalism. Such
social actions are not necessarily monetarised, but they represent an extension
of the market principle into non-economic area of life - again typical for
neoliberalism" Corrupted Neoliberalism. The rise of neoliberalism in the 1970s
as a practical system of government saw it implemented in various forms across
the world. In some cases, the result was not anything that could be identified
as neoliberalism, often with catastrophic results for the poor. This has
resulted in many on the left claiming that this is a deliberate goal of
neoliberalism, while those on the right defend the original goals of
neoliberalism and insist otherwise, an argument that rages to this day,
rendering this section highly controversial. This section attempts to provide
an unbiased overview of this discussion, focusing on all the forms of
neoliberalism that are not in any way neoliberal, but which have come to be
associated with it, as well as the reasons for why this has happened. One of
the best and least controversial examples of "neoliberal" reform is Russia,
whose reforms in 1989 were justified under neoliberal economic policy but which
lacked any of the basic features of a neoliberal state (e.g. the rule of law,
free press) which could have justified the reforms. General Liberal Failure.
The least controversial aspect of neoliberalism has often been presented by
modern economists critical of neoliberalism's role in the world economic
system. Among these economists, the chief voices of dissent are Joseph Stiglitz
and Paul Krugman, who base their ideas chiefly on actual economic theory. Their
ideas also handily correlate with Friedrich Hayek's assumptions behind
classical neoliberalism outlined earlier. This makes this an excellent place to
start the discussion. Both use arguments about market failure to justify their
views on neoliberalism. They argue that when markets are imperfect (which is to
say all markets everywhere to some degree), then they can fail and may not work
as neoliberals predict, resulting in some form of crony capitalism. The two
chief modes of failure are usually due to imperfect property rights and due to
imperfect information and correspond directly to Friedrich Hayek's assertion
that classical liberalism will not work without protection of the private
sphere and the prevention of fraud and deception. The failure of property
rights means that individuals can't protect ownership of their resources and
control what happens to them, or prevent other taking them away. This usually
stifles free enterprise and results in preferential treatment for those who
can. The failure of information is very important since free information flow
is responsible for the self-regulating nature of neoliberal markets and
justifies putting them beyond government regulation. Control of information
also, as Hayek notes, allows control of the actions of an individual, rendering
any liberal system illiberal. Crony Capitalism. The most blatant form of crony
capitalism is the creation of a liberal economic system in which only some
people ("cronies") are permitted property rights by the government in return
for support for the regime, allowing supporters of the regime to expropriate
any capital held by opponents. This is a very useful and powerful method of
control which is usually seen in its purest form in countries with
dictatorships, where the regime can create a liberal system of markets and
government without ceding any control of either. Such reforms can also be used
to add a sprinkling of liberal legitimacy for the regime and open the country
to external capital. This form is useful to explain neoliberal reforms in
countries where either the will or ability to enforce property rights is
lacking, such as the problems of post Soviet Russia, in which reformist
politicians colluded with politically connected business people. In return for
backing democratic free market reforms, these business figures could
expropriate resources in a country where ownership was not clear and
sporadically enforced, leading to the rise of the Russian oligarchs. Class
Project. Not all members of a society may have equal access to the law or to
information, even when everyone is theoretically equal under the law, as in a
liberal democracy. This is because access to the law and information is not
free as liberals (such as Hayek) assume, but have associated costs. Therefore,
it is usually true to say that the wealthy have greater rights than the poor.
In some cases, the poor may have practically no rights at all if their income
falls below the levels necessary to access the law and unbiased sources of
information, while the very wealthy may have the ability to choose which rights
and responsibilities they bear if they can move themselves and their property
internationally, resulting in social stratification, also known as class. This
tendency to create and strengthen class has resulted in some (most famously
David Harvey) claiming that neoliberalism is a class project, designed to
impose class on society through liberalism. Globalization. In practise, less
developing nations have less developed rights and institutions, resulting in
greater risk for international lenders and businesses. This means that
developing countries usually have less privileged access to international
markets than developed countries. Because of this effect, international lenders
are also more likely to invest in foreign companies (i.e. multinational
corporations) inside a country, rather than in local businesses, giving
international firms an unfair competitive advantage. Also, speculative flows of
capital may enter the country during a boom and leave during a recession,
deepening economic crises and destabilizing the economy. Both of these problems
imply that developing countries should have greater protections against
international markets than developed ones and greater barriers to trade.
Despite such problems, IMF policy in response to crises, which is supposed to
be guided by neoliberal ideas such as the Washington Consensus, is to increase
liberalization of the economy and decrease barriers, allowing bigger capital
flight and the chance for foreign firms to shore up their monopolies.
Additionally, the IMF acts to increase moral hazard, since international
involvement will usually result in an international bailout with foreign
creditors being treated preferentially, leading international firms to discount
the risks of doing business in less developed countries and forcing the
government to pay for them instead. The fact that international involvement and
the imposition of "neoliberal" policies usually serves to make things worse and
acts against the interests of the country being "saved", has led some to argue
that the policies have nothing to do with any form of liberalism, but hide some
other purpose. The most common assertion given by opponents is that are a form
of neocolonialism, where the more developed countries can exploit the less
developed countries. However, even opponents do not agree. For example,
Stiglitz assumes that there is no neoimperial plot, but that the system is
driven by a mixture of ideology and special interests, in which neoliberal
fundamentalists, who do not believe that neoliberalism can fail, work with
financial and other multinational corporations, who have the most to benefit
from opening up foreign markets. David Harvey, on the other hand, argues that
local elites exploit neoliberal reforms in order to impose reforms that benefit
them at the cost of the poor, while transferring the blame onto the "evil
imperialist" developed countries, citing the example of Argentina in 2001.
Corporatocracy. Some claim that neoliberalism is a form of corporatocracy, the
rule of a country by and for the benefit of large corporations. Since large
corporations tend to fulfil all the conditions of a wealthy entity, they accrue
many of the same benefits over smaller businesses that the rich do over the
poor. In addition, multinational corporations enjoy the benefits of
neoimperialism on the international stage and can also move their base of
operations from a country if that country pursues policies that it deems to be
unfriendly to business, a threat which they can use to make governments behave.
Although classical neoliberalism rests on the free flow of information, the
neoliberal era has been marked by an unprecedented expansion of intellectual
property and copyright, an expansion of libel laws to silence criticism (e.g.
libel tourism) and expanding corporate secrecy (e.g. in the UK corporations
used contract law to forbid discussion of salaries, thereby controlling labour
costs), all of which came to be seen as a normal part of neoliberalism, but are
wholly against its spirit. Finally, the fact that many media outlets are
themselves part of large corporations leads to a conflict of interest between
those corporations and the public good. Reach and effects. Effects in Latin
American urbanization. Between the 1930s and the late 1970s most countries in
Latin America used the import substitution industrialization model (ISI) to
build industry and reduce the dependency on imports from foreign countries. The
result of ISI in these countries included rapid urbanization of one or two
major cities, a growing urban population of the working class, and frequent
protests by trade unions and left-wing parties. In response to the economic
crisis, the leaders of these countries quickly adopted and implemented new
neoliberal policies due to prospect theory. A study based on the
transformations of urban life and systems as a result of neoliberalism in six
countries of Latin America was published by Alejandro Portes and Bryan Roberts.
This comparative study included census data analysis, surveying, and fieldwork
focused in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Peru, and Uruguay. Predictions of
the neoliberalism were extended to these six countries in four areas: urban
systems and primacy, urban unemployment and informal employment, urban
inequality and poverty, and urban crime and victimization. Data collected
support a relationship between the economic policies of neoliberalism and the
resulting patterns of urbanization. In the area of urban systems and primacy
two tendencies were revealed in the data. The first was continuing growth in
total size of urban populations while the second tendency was the decline in
size of the principal city with decreased migration flows to these cities.
Therefore, when calculating the urban growth rate each of these countries all
showed minimal or a significant decline in growth. Portes and Roberts theorize
that the changes are due to the ‚Äúloss of attraction of major cities...due to
a complex set of factors, but is undoubtedly a related to the end of the ISI
era‚Äù. Although the relationship between the open-market and the
transformation of urban systems has not been proven to be a perfect one-to-one
relationship, the evidence supports the acceleration or initiation of these two
tendencies following neoliberal changes. There was also a variation in the
inequality and poverty in the six countries. While the majority of the
population within these countries suffered from poverty, the "upper classes"
received the benefits of the neoliberal system. According to Portes and
Roberts, ‚Äúthe ‚Äòprivileged decile‚Äô received average incomes equivalent to
fourteen times the average Latin American poverty-line income‚Äù. According to
the authors, a direct result of the income inequality is that each country
struggled with increased crime and victimization in both urban and suburban
settings. However, due to corruption within the police force it is not possible
to accurately extrapolate a trend in the data of crime and victimization.
Effects on global health. The effect of neoliberalism on global health,
particularly the aspect of international aid involves key players such as Non-
governmental organizations (NGOs), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and
the World Bank. Neoliberal emphasis has been placed on free markets and
privatization which has been tied to the "new policy agenda", an agenda in
which NGOs are viewed to provide better social welfare than that of a nation's
government. International NGO's have been promoted to fill holes in public
services created by the World Bank and IMF through their promotion of
Structural Adjustment Programs (SAP's) which slash government health spending
and are an unsustainable source of foreign aid. The reduced health spending and
the gain of the public health sector by NGOs causes the local health system to
become fragmented, undermines local control of health programs and contributes
to local social inequality between NGO workers and local individuals. Support.
Political freedom. In "Capitalism and Freedom" (1962), Friedman developed the
argument that economic freedom, while itself an extremely important component
of total freedom, is also a necessary condition for political freedom. He
commented that centralized control of economic activities was always
accompanied with political repression. In his view, the voluntary character of
all transactions in an unregulated market economy and wide diversity that it
permits are fundamental threats to repressive political leaders and greatly
diminish power to coerce. Through elimination of centralized control of
economic activities, economic power is separated from political power, and the
one can serve as counterbalance to the other. Friedman feels that competitive
capitalism is especially important to minority groups, since impersonal market
forces protect people from discrimination in their economic activities for
reasons unrelated to their productivity. It is important to take into account,
however, that an early neoliberal regime was attempted in Chile under what some
would consider a military dictatorship and severe social repression. Chile now
enjoys the highest rate of GDP per capita in Latin America; this lends strong
credence to the assertion that economic freedom is more important to prosperity
than are democratic institutions. Also, increased economic freedom put pressure
on the dictatorship over time and increased political freedom. In "The Road to
Serfdom", Hayek argued that "Economic control is not merely control of a sector
of human life which can be separated from the rest; it is the control of the
means for all our ends." Opposition. Critics sometimes refer to neoliberalism
as the "American Model," and make the claim that it promotes low wages and high
inequality. According to the economists Howell and Diallo (2007), neoliberal
policies have contributed to a U.S. economy in which 30% of workers earn low
wages (less than two-thirds the median wage for full-time workers), and 35% of
the labor force is underemployed; only 40% of the working-age population in the
U.S. is adequately employed. The Center for Economic Policy Research's (CEPR)
Dean Baker (2006) argued that the driving force behind rising inequality in the
U.S. has been a series of deliberate, neoliberal policy choices including anti-
inflationary bias, anti-unionism, and profiteering in the health industry.
However, countries have applied neoliberal policies at varying levels of
intensity; for example, the OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
Development) has calculated that only 6% of Swedish workers are beset with
wages it considers low, and that Swedish wages are overall lower due to their
lack of neoliberal policies John Schmitt and Ben Zipperer (2006) of the CEPR
have analyzed the effects of intensive Anglo-American neoliberal policies in
comparison to continental European neoliberalism, concluding "The U.S. economic
and social model is associated with substantial levels of social exclusion,
including high levels of income inequality, high relative and absolute poverty
rates, poor and unequal educational outcomes, poor health outcomes, and high
rates of crime and incarceration. At the same time, the available evidence
provides little support for the view that U.S.-style labor-market flexibility
dramatically improves labor-market outcomes. Despite popular prejudices to the
contrary, the U.S. economy consistently affords a lower level of economic
mobility than all the continental European countries for which data is
available." Notable critics of neoliberalism in theory or practice include
economists Joseph Stiglitz, Amartya Sen, and Robert Pollin, linguist Noam
Chomsky, geographer David Harvey, and the alter-globalization movement in
general, including groups such as ATTAC. Critics of neoliberalism argue that
not only is neoliberalism's critique of socialism (as unfreedom) wrong, but
neoliberalism cannot deliver the liberty that is supposed to be one of its
strong points. Daniel Brook's "The Trap" (2007), Robert Frank's "Falling
Behind" (2007), Robert Chernomas and Ian Hudson's "Social Murder" (2007), and
Richard G. Wilkinson's "The Impact of Inequality" (2005) all claim high
inequality is spurred by neoliberal policies and produces profound political,
social, economic, health, and environmental constraints and problems. The
economists and policy analysts at the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives
(CCPA) offer inequality-reducing social democratic policy alternatives to
neoliberal policies. Santa Cruz History of Consciousness professor Angela Davis
and Princeton sociologist Bruce Western have claimed that the high rate
(compared to Europe) of incarceration in the U.S.¬ ‚Äì specifically 1 in 37
American adults is in the prison system¬ ‚Äì heavily promoted by the Clinton
administration, is the neoliberal U.S. policy tool for keeping unemployment
statistics low, while stimulating economic growth through the maintenance of a
contemporary slave population and the promotion of prison construction and
"militarized policing." The Clinton Administration also embraced neoliberalism
by pursuing international trade agreements that would benefit the corporate
sector globally (normalization of trade with China for example). Domestically,
Clinton fostered such neoliberal reforms as the corporate takeover of health
care in the form of the HMO, the reduction of welfare subsidies, and the
implementation of "Workfare". Neoliberal policies advanced by supranational
organizations have come under criticism, from both socialist and libertarian
writers, for advancing a corporatist agenda. Rajesh Makwana, on the left,
writes that ‚Äúthe World Bank and IMF, are major exponents of the neoliberal
agenda‚Äù advancing corporate interests. Free market economist Richard M.
Salsman goes further and argues the IMF ‚Äúis a destructive, crisis-generating
global welfare agency that should be abolished.‚Äù He quotes Donald J.
Boudreaux on the need to abolish the IMF.
