Mesoamerican Long Count calendar The Mesoamerican Long Count calendar is a non-
repeating, vigesimal (base-20) and base-18 calendar used by several Pre-
Columbian Mesoamerican cultures, most notably the Maya. For this reason, it is
sometimes known as the Maya (or Mayan) Long Count calendar. Using a modified
vigesimal tally, the Long Count calendar identifies a day by counting the
number of days passed since a mythical creation date that corresponds to August
11, 3114 BCE in the Gregorian calendar. The Long Count calendar was widely used
on monuments. Background. Among other calendars devised in pre-Columbian
Mesoamerica, two of the most widely used were the 365-day solar calendar (the
Maya version is known as the "Haab"') and the 260-day calendar, with 20 periods
of 13 days. In Mayan studies this 260-day calendar is known as the "Tzolk'in";
the equivalent Aztec calendar is known by a Nahuatl name, "tonalpohualli". The
Haab' and the Tzolk'in calendars identified and named the days, but not the
years. The combination of a Haab' date and a Tzolk'in date identifies a
specific date in a combination which did not occur again for 52 years. The two
calendars based on 365 days and 260 days repeat every 52 Haab' years, a period
generally known as the Calendar Round. To designate dates over periods longer
than 52 years, some Mesoamericans utilized the Long Count calendar. Long Count
periods. The Long Count calendar identifies a date by counting the number of
days from a starting date that is generally calculated to be August 11, 3114
BCE in the proleptic Gregorian calendar or September 6 in the Julian calendar
(or âˆ’3113 in astronomical year numbering). There has been much debate over
the precise correlation between the Western calendars and the Long Count
calendars. The August 11 date is based on the GMT correlation (see Correlations
between Western calendars and the Long Count calendar section elsewhere in this
article for details on correlations). The completion of 13 b'ak'tuns (August
11, 3114 BCE) marks the Creation of the world of human beings according to the
Maya. On this day, Raised-up-Sky-Lord caused three stones to be set by
associated gods at Lying-Down-Sky, First-Three-Stone-Place. Because the sky
still lay on the primordial sea, it was black. The setting of the three stones
centered the cosmos which allowed the sky to be raised, revealing the Rather
than using a base-10 scheme, like Western numbering, the Long Count days were
tallied in a base-20 and base-18 scheme. Thus 0.0.0.1.5 is equal to 25, and
0.0.0.2.0 is equal to 40. The Long Count is not consistently base-20, however,
since the second digit from the right rolls over to zero when it reaches 18.
Thus 0.0.1.0.0 does not represent 400 days, but rather only 360 days. Note that
the name b'ak'tun is a back-formation invented by scholars. The numbered Long
Count was no longer in use by the time the Spanish arrived in the YucatÃ¡n
Peninsula, although unnumbered k'atuns and tuns were still in use. Instead the
Maya were using an abbreviated Short Count. Mesoamerican numerals. Long Count
dates are written with Mesoamerican numerals, as shown on this table. A dot
represents "1" while a bar equals "5". The shell glyph was used to represent
the zero concept. The Long Count calendar required the use of zero as a place-
holder, and presents one of the earliest uses of the zero concept in history.
See also History of zero. On Maya monuments, the Long Count syntax is more
complex. The date sequence is given once, at the beginning of the inscription,
and opens with the so-called ISIG (Introductory Series Initial Glyph) which
reads "tzik-a(h) habâ€™ of Haab' month" ("revered was the year-count with the
patron the month"). Next come the 5 digits of the Long Count, followed by the
Calendar Round (tzolk'in and Haab') and supplementary series. The supplementary
series is optional and contains lunar data, for example, the age of the moon on
the day and the calculated length of current lunation. The text then continues
with whatever activity occurred on that date. A drawing of a full Maya Long
Count inscription is shown below. Earliest Long Counts. The earliest Long Count
inscription yet discovered is on Stela 2 at Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas, Mexico,
showing a date of 36 BCE. This table lists the six artifacts with the eight
oldest Long Counts according to Vincent H. MalmstrÃ¶m. Of the six sites, three
are on the western edge of the Maya homeland and three are several hundred
kilometers further west, leading most researchers to believe that the Long
Count calendar predates the Maya. La Mojarra Stela 1, the Tuxtla Statuette,
Tres Zapotes Stela C, and Chiapa Stela 2 are all inscribed in an Epi-Olmec, not
Maya, style. El BaÃºl Stela 2, on the other hand, was created in the Izapan
style. The first unequivocally Maya artifact is Stela 29 from Tikal, with the
Long Count date of 292 CE (8.12.14.8.15), more than 300 years after Stela 2
from Chiapa de Corzo. Correlations between Western calendars and the Long
Count. The Maya and western calendars are correlated by using a Julian day
number of the starting date of the current creation â€“ 13.0.0.0.0 4 Ajaw, 8
Kumk'u. This is referred to as a correlation constant. The generally accepted
correlation constant is the Modified Thompson 2, "Goodman, Martinez, Thompson"
â€“ GMT correlation of 584,283 days. Using the GMT correlation the current
creation started on September 6, 3114 BC (Julian) or August 11 in the Proleptic
Gregorian calendar. The study of correlating the Maya and western calendar is
referred to as the correlation question. In "Breaking the Maya Code", Michael
D. Coe writes: "In spite of oceans of ink that have been spilled on the
subject, there now is not the slightest chance that these three scholars
(conflated to GMT when talking about the correlation) were not right...".
"Historical": Calendar Round dates with a corresponding Julian date are
recorded in Diego de Landa's "RelaciÃ³n de las cosas de YucatÃ¡n", the
Chronicle of Oxcutzkab and the books of Chilam Balam. Oxcutzkab and de Landa
record a date that is a Tun ending. Regarding these historical references in
"The Skywatchers" Aveni writes: "All the assembled data are consistent with the
equation November 2, 1539 = 11.16.0.0.0. Thus for the GMT, or 11.16 correlation
we find that A = 584,283...". The fall of the capital city of the Aztec Empire,
Tenochtitlan, occurred on August 13, 1521. A number of different chroniclers
wrote that this was a Tzolk'in (Tonalpohualli) of 1 Snake. Post-conquest
scholars such as Sahagun and Duran recorded Aztec calendar dates with a
calendar date. Many indigenous Guatemalan communities, principally those
speaking the Mayan languages known as Ixil, Mam, PokomchÃ­, and QuichÃ©, keep
the Tzolk'in and (in many cases) the Haab' and in Veracruz, Oaxaca and Chiapas,
Mexico These are all consistent with the GMT correlation. "Astronomical": Any
correct correlation must match the astronomical content of classic
inscriptions. The GMT correlation does an excellent job of matching lunar data
in the supplementary series. For example: An inscription at the Temple of the
Sun at Palenque records that on Long Count 9.16.4.10.8 there were 26 days
completed in a 30 day lunation. This Long Count is also the entry date for the
eclipse table of the Dresden Codex which gives eclipse seasons when the Moon is
near its ascending or descending node and an eclipse is likely to occur. Dates
converted using the GMT correlation fall roughly in this eclipse season. The
Dresden Codex contains a Venus table which records the heliacal risings of
Venus. The GMT correlation agrees with these to within a few days which is as
accurately as these could have been observed by the ancient Maya.
"Archaeological": Various items that can be associated with specific Long Count
dates have been isotope dated. In 1959 the University of Pennsylvania carbon
dated samples from ten wood lintels from Tikal. These were carved with a date
equivalent to 741 AD using the GMT correlation. The average carbon date was
746Â±34 years. If a proposed correlation only has to agree with one of these
lines of evidence there could be numerous other possibilities. Astronomers have
proposed many correlations, for example: Lounsbury, Fuls, "et al.", BÃ¶hm and
BÃ¶hm and Stock. Today, , in the Long Count is (GMT correlation). 2012 and the
Long Count. According to the "Popol Vuh", a book compiling details of creation
accounts known to the K'iche' Maya of the Colonial-era highlands, we are living
in the fourth world. The "Popol Vuh" describes the first three creations that
the gods failed in making and the creation of the successful fourth world where
men were placed. In the Maya Long Count, the previous creation ended at the
start of a 14th b'ak'tun. The previous creation ended on a long count of
12.19.19.17.19. Another 12.19.19.17.19 will occur on December 20, 2012,
followed by the start of the 14th b'ak'tun, 13.0.0.0.0, on December 21, 2012.
There are only two references to the current creation's 13th b'ak'tun in the
fragmentary Mayan corpus: Tortuguero Monument 6, part of a ruler's inscription
and the recently discovered La Corona Hieroglyphic Stairway 2, Block V. http://
decipherment.wordpress.com/2012/06/30/notes-on-a-new-text-from-la-corona/ Maya
inscriptions occasionally reference future predicted events or commemorations
that would occur on dates that lie beyond 2012 (that is, beyond the completion
of the 13th "b'ak'tun" of the current era). Most of these are in the form of
"distance dates" where some Long Count date is given, together with a Distance
Number that is to be added to the Long Count date to arrive at this future
date. For example, on the west panel at the Temple of Inscriptions in Palenque,
a section of the text projects into the future to the 80th Calendar Round (CR)
'anniversary' of the famous Palenque ruler K'inich Janaab' Pakal's accession to
the throne (Pakal's accession occurred on a Calendar Round date 5 Lamat 1 Mol,
at Long Count 9.9.2.4.8 equivalent to 27 July 615 CE in the proleptic Gregorian
calendar). It does this by commencing with Pakal's birthdate 9.8.9.13.08 Ajaw
13 Pop (24 March ) and adding to it the Distance Number 10.11.10.5.8. This
calculation arrives at the 80th Calendar Round since his accession, a day that
also has a CR date of , but which lies over 4,000 years in the future from
Pakal's timeâ€”the day 21 October in the year 4772. The inscription notes that
this day would fall eight days after the completion of the 1st "piktun" the
creation or zero date of the Long Count system, where the "piktun" is the next-
highest order above the "b'ak'tun" in the Long Count. If the completion date of
that "piktun"â€”13 October 4772â€”were to be written out in Long Count
notation, it could be represented as 1.0.0.0.0.0. The 80th CR anniversary date,
eight days later, would be 1.0.0.0.0.8. Despite the publicity generated by the
2012 date, Susan Milbrath, curator of Latin American Art and Archaeology at the
Florida Museum of Natural History, stated that "We have no record or knowledge
that Maya would think the world would come to an end" in 2012. "For the ancient
Maya, it was a huge celebration to make it to the end of a whole cycle," says
Sandra Noble, executive director of the Foundation for the Advancement of
Mesoamerican Studies in Crystal River, Florida. To render December 21, 2012, as
a doomsday event or moment of cosmic shifting, she says, is "a complete
fabrication and a chance for a lot of people to cash in." "There will be
another cycle," says E. Wyllys Andrews V, director of the Tulane University
Middle American Research Institute (MARI). "We know the Maya thought there was
one before this, and that implies they were comfortable with the idea of
another one after this." Calculating a full Long Count date. As stated, a full
Long Count date not only includes the five digits of the Long Count, but the 2-
character Tzolk'in and the two-character Haab' dates as well. The five digit
Long Count can therefore be confirmed with the other four characters (the
"calendar round date"). Taking as an example a Calendar Round date of
9.12.2.0.16 (Long Count) 5 Kib' (Tzolk'in) 14 Yaxk'in (Haab'). One can check
whether this date is correct by the following calculation. It is perhaps easier
to find out how many days there are since 4 Ajaw 8 Kumk'u, and show how the
date 5 Kib' 14 Yaxk'in is derived. Calculating the Tzolk'in date portion. The
Tzolk'in date is counted forward from 4 Ajaw. To calculate the numerical
portion of the Tzolk'in date, add 4 to the total number of days given by the
date, and then divide total number of days by 13. This means that 106395 whole
13 day cycles have been completed, and the numerical portion of the Tzolk'in
date is 5. To calculate the day, divide the total number of days in the long
count by 20 since there are twenty day names. This means 16 day names must be
counted from Ajaw. This gives Kib'. Therefore, the Tzolk'in date is 5 Kib'.
Calculating the Haab' date portion. The Haab' date 8 Kumk'u is the ninth day of
the eighteenth month. There are 17 days to the start of the next year. Subtract
17 days from the total, to find how many complete Haab' years are contained.
Divide by 365 Therefore, 3789 complete Haab' have passed, and the remainder 134
is the 135th day in the new Haab', since a remainder of 0 would indicate the
first day. Find which month the day is in. Dividing the remainder 134 by 20, is
six complete months, and a remainder of 14, indicating the 15th day. So, the
date in the Haab' lies in the seventh month, which is Yaxk'in. The fifteenth
day of Yaxk'in is 14, thus the Haab' date is 14 Yaxk'in. So the date of the
long count date 9.12.2.0.16 5 Kib' 14 Yaxk'in is confirmed. Piktuns and higher
orders. There are also four rarely used higher-order periods above the
b'ak'tun: "piktun", "kalabtun", "k'inchiltun", and "alautun". All of these
words are inventions of Mayanists. Most inscriptions that use these are in the
form of distance dates and Long Reckonings - they give a base date, a distance
number that is added or subtracted and the resulting Long Count. By studying
these Eric Thompson determined that the date of creation in 3114 BCE â€“
13.0.0.0.0 was actually ...13.13.0.0.0.0 in the extended version. For example a
Late Classic monument from Coba, Stela 1. The date of creation is expressed as
13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.0.0.0.0, where the
units are 13s in the nineteen places larger than the b'ak'tun. The inscription
on Quirigua stela F, or 6, shows a Long Count date of 9.16.10.0.0 1 Ahau 3 Zip
(March 15, 761 Gregorian). The huge distance date of 1.8.13.0.9.16.10.0.0 is
subtracted and the resulting date is given as (18.)13.0.0.0.0.0.0.0 1 Ahau 13
Yaxkin, which is equivalent to a day over 90 million years in the past. There
is another distance date on Quirigua Stela D or 4, that gives a date of
9.16.15.0.0 7 Ahau 18 Pop (February 17, 766 Gregorian), to which is added
6.8.13.0.9.16.15.0.0, to give a date of (13.)13.0.0.0.0.0.0.0. This is over 400
million years after the date the stela was erected. Ring number (12)
