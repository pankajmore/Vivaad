Cult The word cult in current popular usage usually refers to a new religious
movement or other group whose beliefs or practices are considered abnormal or
bizarre. The word originally denoted a system of ritual practices. The word was
first used in the early 17th century denoting homage paid to a divinity and
borrowed via the French "culte" from Latin "cultus" "worship", from the
adjective "cultus" "inhabited, cultivated, worshipped", derived from the verb
"colere" "care, cultivate". In the 1930s cults became the object of
sociological study in the context of the study of religious behavior. They have
been criticized by mainstream Christians for their unorthodox beliefs. In the
1970s the anticult movement arose, partly motivated by acts of violence and
other crimes committed by members of some cults (notably the Manson Family and
People's Temple). Some of the claims of the anti-cult movement have been
disputed by other scholars, leading to further controversies. Government
reaction to cults has led to controversy. Cults have also been featured in
popular culture. Origin. Origins in sociology. The concept of "cult" was
introduced into sociological classification in 1932 by American sociologist
Howard P. Becker as an expansion of German theologian Ernst Troeltsch's church-
sect typology. Troeltsch's aim was to distinguish between three main types of
religious behavior: churchly, sectarian and mystical. Becker created four
categories out of Troeltsch's first two by splitting "church" into "ecclesia"
and "denomination", and "sect" into "sect" and "cult". Like Troeltsch's
"mystical religion", Becker's cults were small religious groups lacking in
organization and emphasizing the private nature of personal beliefs. Later
formulations built on these characteristics while placing an additional
emphasis on cults as deviant religious groups "deriving their inspiration from
outside of the predominant religious culture". This deviation is often thought
to lead to a high degree of tension between the group and the more mainstream
culture surrounding it, a characteristic shared with religious sects.
Sociologists still maintain that unlike sects, which are products of religious
schism and therefore maintain a continuity with traditional beliefs and
practices, "cults" arise spontaneously around novel beliefs and practices.
Popularizing the word: Anti-cult movements and their impact. In the 1940s, the
long held opposition by some established Christian denominations to non-
Christian religions or/and supposedly heretical, or counterfeit, pseudo-
Christian sects crystallized into a more organized "Christian countercult
movement" in the United States (using a doctrinal definition comparing the
essential doctrines of established, Bible-based Christianity with the other
groups deemed heretical). For those belonging to the movement, all religious
groups claiming to be Christian, but deemed outside of Christian orthodoxy,
were considered "cults". As more foreign religious traditions found their way
into the United States, the religious movements they brought with them
attracted even fiercer resistance. This was especially true for movements
incorporating mystical or exotic new beliefs and those with charismatic,
authoritarian leaders. They widened their scope to also critique (from a Bible-
based, traditional Christian perspective) world religions and the occult,
including the eclectic New Age Movement. In the early 1970s, a secular
opposition movement to "cult" groups had taken shape. The organizations that
formed the secular "Anti-cult movement" (ACM) often acted on behalf of
relatives of "cult" converts who did not believe their loved ones could have
altered their lives so drastically by their own free will. A few psychologists
and sociologists working in this field lent credibility to their disbelief by
suggesting that "brainwashing techniques" were used to maintain the loyalty of
"cult" members. The belief that cults "brainwashed" their members became a
unifying theme among cult critics and in the more extreme corners of the Anti-
cult movement techniques like the sometimes forceful "deprogramming" of "cult
members" becoming standard practice. In the meantime, a handful of high profile
crimes were committed by groups identified as cults, or by the groups' leaders.
The mass suicides committed by members of the People's Temple in Jonestown,
Guyana, and the Manson Family murders are perhaps the most prominent examples
in American popular culture. The publicity of these crimes, as amplified by the
Anti-cult movement, influenced the popular perception of new religious
movements. In the mass media, and among average citizens, "cult" gained an
increasingly negative connotation, becoming associated with things like
kidnapping, brainwashing, psychological abuse, sexual abuse and other criminal
activity, and mass suicide. While most of these negative qualities usually have
real documented precedents in the activities of a very small minority of new
religious groups, mass culture often extends them to any religious group viewed
as culturally deviant, however peaceful or law abiding it may be. In the late
1980s, psychologists and sociologists started to abandon theories like
brainwashing and mind-control. While scholars may believe that various less
dramatic coercive psychological mechanisms could influence group members, they
came to see conversion to new religious movements principally as an act of a
rational choice. "New religious movements". Most sociologists and scholars of
religion also began to reject the word "cult" altogether because of its
negative connotations in mass culture. Some began to advocate the use of new
terms like "new religious movement", "alternative religion" or "novel religion"
to describe most of the groups that had come to be referred to as "cults", yet
none of these terms have had much success in popular culture or in the media.
Other scholars have pushed to redeem the word as one fit for neutral academic
discourse, while researchers aligned with the Anti-cult movement have attempted
to reduce the negative connotations being associated with all such groups by
classifying only some as "destructive cults". The study of cults. While most
scholars no longer refer to any new religious movements as cults, some
sociologists still favor retaining the word as it was used in church-sect
typologies. For this value-neutral use of the word, please refer to new
religious movements. Other scholars and non-academic researchers who use the
word do so from explicitly critical perspectives which focus on the
relationship between cult groups and the individual people who join them. These
perspectives share the assumption that some form of coercive persuasion or mind
control is used to recruit and maintain members by suppressing their ability to
reason, think critically, and make choices in their own best interest. However,
most social scientists believe that mind control theories have no scientific
merit in relation to religious movements. Mind control. This view is disputed
by scholars such as James Gene and Bette Nove Evans. "Society for the
Scientific Study of Religion" stated in 1990 that there was not sufficient
research to permit a consensus on the matter and that "one should not
automatically equate the techniques involved in the process of physical
coercion and control with those of nonphysical coercion and control". Potential
for harm. In the opinion of Benjamin Zablacki, a professor of Sociology at
Rutgers University, groups that have been characterized as cults are at high
risk of becoming abusive to members. He states that this is in part due to
members' adulation of charismatic leaders contributing to the leaders becoming
corrupted by power. Zablocki defines a cult as an ideological organization held
together by charismatic relationships and the demand of total commitment.
According to Barrett, the most common accusation made against groups referred
to as cults is sexual abuse (see some allegations made by former members).
According to Kranenborg, some groups are risky when they advise their members
not to use regular medical care. Certain cults have been accused of severely
abusing children. Psychological dynamics of cult joiners. Michael Langone,
executive director of the International Cultic Studies Association, gives three
different models for conversion. Under Langone's deliberative model, people are
said to join cults primarily because of how they view a particular group.
Langone notes that this view is most favored among sociologists and religious
scholars. Under the "psychodynamic model", popular with some mental health
professionals, individuals choose to join for fulfillment of subconscious
psychological needs. Finally, the "thought reform model" states that people do
not join because of their own psychological needs, but because of the group's
influence through forms of psychological manipulation. Langone claims that
those mental health experts who have more direct experience with large numbers
of cultists tend to favor this latter view. Some scholars favor one particular
view, or combined elements of each. According to Marc Galanter, Professor of
Psychiatry at NYU, typical reasons why people join cults include a search for
community and a spiritual quest. Sociologists Stark and Bainbridge, in
discussing the process by which individuals join new religious groups, have
even questioned the utility of the concept of "conversion", suggesting that
"affiliation" is a more useful concept. In the 1960s sociologist John Lofland
lived with Unification Church missionary Young Oon Kim and a small group of
American church members in California and studied their activities in trying to
promote their beliefs and win new members. Lofland noted that most of their
efforts were ineffective and that most of the people who joined did so because
of personal relationships with other members, often family relationships.
Lofland published his findings in 1964 as a doctorial thesis entitled: "The
World Savers: A Field Study of Cult Processes", and in 1966 in book form by
Prentice-Hall as "". It is considered to be one of the most important and
widely cited studies of the process of religious conversion. Leaving. There are
several ways people leave a cult: Popular authors Conway and Siegelman
conducted a survey and published it in the book "Snapping" regarding after-cult
effects and deprogramming and concluded that people deprogrammed had fewer
problems than people not deprogrammed. The BBC writes that, "in a survey done
by Jill Mytton on 200 former cult members most of them reported problems
adjusting to society and about a third would benefit from some counseling".
Ronald Burks, in a study comparing Group Psychological Abuse Scale (GPA) and
Neurological Impairment Scale (NIS) scores in 132 former members of cults and
cultic relationships, found a positive correlation between intensity of reform
environment as measured by the GPA and cognitive impairment as measured by the
NIS. Additional findings were a reduced earning potential in view of the
education level that corroborates earlier studies of cult critics (Martin 1993;
Singer & Ofshe, 1990; West & Martin, 1994) and significant levels of depression
and dissociation agreeing with Conway & Siegelman, (1982), Lewis & Bromley,
(1987) and Martin, et al. (1992). Sociologists Bromley and Hadden note a lack
of empirical support for claimed consequences of having been a member of a
"cult" or "sect", and substantial empirical evidence against it. These include
the fact that the overwhelming proportion of people who get involved in NRMs
leave, most short of two years; the overwhelming proportion of people who leave
do so of their own volition; and that two-thirds (67%) felt "wiser for the
experience". According to F. Derks and J. van der Lans, there is no uniform
post-cult trauma. While psychological and social problems upon resignation are
not uncommon, their character and intensity are greatly dependent on the
personal history and on the traits of the ex-member, and on the reasons for and
way of resignation. The report of the "Swedish Government's Commission on New
Religious Movements" (1998) states that the great majority of members of new
religious movements derive positive experiences from their subscription to
ideas or doctrines which correspond to their personal needs, and that
withdrawal from these movements is usually quite undramatic, as these people
leave feeling enriched by a predominantly positive experience. Although the
report describes that there are a small number of withdrawals that require
support (100 out of 50,000+ people), the report did not recommend that any
special resources be established for their rehabilitation, as these cases are
very rare.The great majority of members of the new religious movements derive
positive experience from their membership. They have subscribed to an idea or
doctrine which corresponds to their personal needs. Membership is of limited
duration in most cases. After two years, the majority have left the movement.
This withdrawal is usually quite undramatic, and the people withdrawing feel
enriched by a predominantly positive experience. The Commission does not
recommend that special resources be established for the rehabilitation of
withdraws. The cases are too few in number and the problem picture too manifold
for this: each individual can be expected to need help from several different
care providers or facilitators. Stuart A. Wright explores the distinction
between the apostate narrative and the role of the apostate, asserting that the
former follows a predictable pattern, in which the apostate utilizes a
"captivity narrative" that emphasizes manipulation, entrapment and being
victims of "sinister cult practices". These narratives provide a rationale for
a "hostage-rescue" motif, in which cults are likened to POW camps and
deprogramming as heroic hostage rescue efforts. He also makes a distinction
between "leavetakers" and "apostates", asserting that despite the popular
literature and lurid media accounts of stories of "rescued or recovering 'ex-
cultists'", empirical studies of defectors from NRMs "generally indicate
favorable, sympathetic or at the very least mixed responses toward their former
group". According to the anti-cult movement. Secular cult opponents like those
belonging to the anti-cult movement tend to define a "cult" as a group that
tends to manipulate, exploit, and control its members. Specific factors in cult
behavior are said to include manipulative and authoritarian mind control over
members, communal and totalistic organization, aggressive proselytizing,
systematic programs of indoctrination, and perpetuation in middle-class
communities. In each, the focus tends to be on the specific tactics of
conversion, the negative impact on individual members, and the difficulty in
leaving once indoctrination has occurred. Criticism by former members. The role
of former members, or "apostates", has been widely studied by social
scientists. At times, these individuals become outspoken public critics of the
groups they leave. Their motivations, the roles they play in the anti-cult
movement, the validity of their testimony, and the kinds of narratives they
construct, are controversial. Some scholars like David G. Bromley, Anson Shupe,
and Brian R. Wilson have challenged the validity of the testimonies presented
by critical former members. Wilson discusses the use of the atrocity story that
is rehearsed by the apostate to explain how, by manipulation, coercion, or
deceit, he was recruited to a group that he now condemns. The hostile ex-
members would invariably shade the truth and blow out of proportion minor
incidents, turning them into major incidents. Stigmatization and
discrimination. Because of the increasingly pejorative use of the words "cult"
and "cult leader" since the cult debate of the 1970s, some academics, in
addition to groups referred to as cults, argue that these are words to be
avoided. Catherine Wessinger (Loyola University New Orleans) has stated that
the word "cult" represents just as much prejudice and antagonism as racial
slurs or derogatory words for women and homosexuals. She has argued that it is
important for people to become aware of the bigotry conveyed by the word,
drawing attention to the way it dehumanises the group's members and their
children. Labeling a group as subhuman, she says, becomes a justification for
violence against it. At the same time, she adds, labeling a group a "cult"
makes people feel safe, because the "violence associated with religion is split
off from conventional religions, projected onto others, and imagined to involve
only aberrant groups." This fails to take into account that child abuse, sexual
abuse, financial extortion and warfare have also been committed by believers of
mainstream religions, but the pejorative "cult" stereotype makes it easier to
avoid confronting this uncomfortable fact. The concept of "cult" as a slur was
legally tested in the United Kingdom when a protester refused to put down a
sign that read, "Scientology is not a religion, it is a dangerous cult", citing
a 1984 high court judgment describing the organization as a cult. The London
police issued a summons to the protester for violating the Public Order Act by
displaying a "threatening, abusive or insulting" sign. The Crown Prosecution
Service ruled that the word "cult" on a sign, "...is not abusive or insulting
and there is no offensiveness, as opposed to criticism, neither in the idea
expressed nor in the mode of expression." There was no action taken against the
protester, and police would allow future such demonstrations. In Scotland, an
official of the Edinburgh City Council told inquiring regular protesters, "I
understand that some of the signs you use may display the word 'cult' and there
is no objection to this." Sociologist Amy Ryan has argued for the need to
differentiate those groups that may be dangerous from groups that are more
benign. Ryan notes the sharp differences between definition from cult
opponents, who tend to focus on negative characteristics, and those of
sociologists, who aim to create definitions that are value-free. The movements
themselves may have different definitions of religion as well. George
Chryssides also cites a need to develop better definitions to allow for common
ground in the debate. These definitions have political and ethical impact
beyond just scholarly debate. In "Defining Religion in American Law", Bruce J.
Casino presents the issue as crucial to international human rights laws.
Limiting the definition of religion may interfere with freedom of religion,
while too broad a definition may give some dangerous or abusive groups "a
limitless excuse for avoiding all unwanted legal obligations". Some authors in
the cult opposition dislike the word cult to the extent it implies that there
is a continuum with a large gray area separating "cult" from "noncult" which
they do not see. Other authors, e.g. Steven Hassan, differentiate by using
words and terms like "Destructive cult", or "Cult" (totalitarian type) vs.
"benign cult". Doomsday cults. An additional commonly used subcategory of cult
movements are the doomsday cults, characterized by the central role played by
eschatology in these groups' belief systems. Although most religions adhere to
some beliefs about the eventual end of the world as we know it, in doomsday
cults, these tend to take the form of concrete prophesies and predictions of
specific catastrophic events being imminent, or in some cases, even expected to
occur on a particular calendar date. This category of religious movements
includes some well-known cases of extremely destructive behavior by adherents
in anticipation of the end of times, such as the mass suicide by members of the
Peoples Temple in 1978, the Branch Davidians in 1993 and the Heaven's Gate in
1997, although many examples are known of doomsday cults that do not become
nearly as destructive. This latter class of doomsday cults are of theoretical
interest to the scholarly study of cults, because of the often paradoxical
response of adherents to the failure of doomsday prophesies to be confirmed.
Social psychologist Leon Festinger and his collaborators performed a detailed
case study of one such group in 1954, subsequently documented in "When Prophecy
Fails". The members of a small, obscure UFO cult in question were very quick to
amend their world-view so as to rationalize the unexpected outcome without
losing their conviction about the validity of the underlying belief system,
despite the obvious evidence to the contrary. The authors explained this
phenomenon within the framework of the cognitive dissonance theory, which
states that people are in general motivated to adjust their beliefs so as to be
consistent with their behavior, in order to avoid the painful experience of a
dissonance between the two. On this account, the more committed one is at the
behavioral level to their beliefs being true, the more driven one is to reduce
the tension created by dis-confirming evidence. An important implication of
this theory is that common, universal psychological factors contribute to the
persistence of what otherwise appear to be bizarre and even absurd sets of
beliefs. Government policy. The difference between the negative and the neutral
definition of the word cult has also had political implications. In the 1970s,
the scientific status of the "brainwashing theory" became a central topic in
U.S. court cases where the theory was instrumental in justifying the use of the
forceful "deprogramming" of cult members. Meanwhile, sociologists critical of
these theories assisted advocates of religious freedom in defending the
legitimacy of new religious movements in court. While the official response to
new religious groups has been mixed across the globe, some governments aligned
more with the critics of these groups to the extent of distinguishing between
"legitimate" religion and "dangerous", "unwanted" cults in public policy.
France and Belgium have taken policy positions which accept "brainwashing"
theories uncritically, while other European nations, like Sweden and Italy, are
cautious about brainwashing and have adopted more neutral responses to new
religions. Scholars have suggested that outrage following the mass murder/
suicides perpetuated by the Solar Temple as well as the more latent xenophobic
and anti-American attitudes have contributed significantly to the extremity of
European anti-cult positions. Since 1949, the People's Republic of China has
been classifying dissenting groups as "xiÃ©jiÃ o"ï¼ˆé‚ªæ•™.ï¼‰ In the Chinese
language, the word xiÃ©jiÃ o translates to "Evil Religion" [é‚ª (xiÃ©) = Evil
æ•™ (jiÃ o)= Religion]. The word xiÃ©jiÃ o as a whole is used to describe what
is known in the Western world as a cult. In recent years, the Chinese
government has allied with Western anti-cult scholars in order to lend
legitimacy to its crackdown on practitioners of Falun Gong. In 2009, Rabbi
Binyamin Kluger and Raphael Aron, director of the Cult Counseling Australia,
spoke at a four-day conference in southern China on cult-fighting strategies.
Aron is a "Lubavitch Jew", a group which might be considered a cult in that its
members believe their former rabbi to be the Messiah. Discussion. Sociologists
critical to this negative politicized use of the word "cult" argue that it may
adversely impact the religious freedoms of group members. In many countries,
there exists a separation of church and state and freedom of religion.
Governments of some of these countries, concerned with possible abuses by
groups they deem cults, have taken restrictive measures against some of their
activities. Critics of such measures claim that the counter-cult movement and
the anti-cult movement have succeeded in influencing governments in
transferring the public's abhorrence of doomsday cults and make the
generalization that it is directed against all small or new religious movements
without discrimination. The critique is countered by stressing that the
measures are directed not against any religious beliefs, but specifically
against groups whom they see as inimical to the public order due to their
totalitarianism, violations of the fundamental liberties, inordinate emphasis
on finances, and/or disregard for appropriate medical care. The application of
the labels "cult" or "sect" to religious movements in government documents
signifies the popular and negative use of the term "cult" in English and a
functionally similar use of words translated as "sect" in several European
languages. While these documents utilize similar terminology they do not
necessarily include the same groups nor is their assessment of these groups
based on agreed criteria. Other governments and world bodies also report on new
religious movements but do not use these terms to describe the groups. (see:
List of groups referred to as cults or sects in government documents) In
literature and popular culture. Cults have been a subject or theme in
literature and popular culture since ancient times. There were many references
to them in the 20th century. External links.
