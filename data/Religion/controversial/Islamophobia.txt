Islamophobia Islamophobia denotes prejudice against, or hatred or irrational
fear of, Muslims. The term dates back to the early 1900s, but its modern use
originates during the late 1980s or early 1990s. It entered the common
vocabulary after the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States. In 1997,
the British Runnymede Trust defined Islamophobia as the "dread or hatred of
Islam and therefore, to the fear and dislike of all Muslims," stating that it
also refers to the practice of discriminating against Muslims by excluding them
from the economic, social, and public life of the nation. It includes the
perception that Islam has no values in common with other cultures, is inferior
to the West and is a violent political ideology rather than a religion.
Islamophobia was recognized as a form of intolerance alongside xenophobia and
antisemitism at the "Stockholm International Forum on Combating Intolerance".
The conference, attended by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, High Commissioner
for Human Rights Mary Robinson, the OSCE Secretary General J√°n Kubis and
representatives of the European Union and Council of Europe, adopted a
declaration to combat "genocide, ethnic cleansing, racism, antisemitism,
Islamophobia and xenophobia, and to combat all forms of racial discrimination
and intolerance related to it." Some scholars of the social sciences consider
it a form of racism, but this is controversial. A perceived trend of increasing
Islamophobia during the 2000s has been attributed by commentators to the
September 11 attacks, while others associate it with the increased presence of
Muslims in the Western world. In May 2002, the European Monitoring Centre on
Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC), a European Union watchdog, released a report
entitled "Summary report on Islamophobia in the EU after 11 September 2001",
which described an increase in Islamophobia-related incidents in European
member states post-9/11. Although the term is widely recognized and used, both
the term and the concept have been criticized. Overview. Professor in History
of Religion, Anne Sophie Roald, states that Islamophobia was recognized as a
form of intolerance alongside xenophobia and antisemitism at the "Stockholm
International Forum on Combating Intolerance". The conference, attended by UN
Secretary General Kofi Annan, High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson,
the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe Secretary General J√°n
Kubis and representatives of the European Union and Council of Europe, adopted
a declaration to combat "genocide, ethnic cleansing, racism, antisemitism,
Islamophobia and xenophobia, and to combat all forms of racial discrimination
and intolerance related to it." A perceived trend of increasing Islamophobia
during the 2000s has been attributed by some commentators to the September 11
attacks, while others associate it with the increased presence of Muslims in
the Western world. Moral panics and "racist" campaigns against Muslims have
been increasing in Australia since the mid 1990s. In May 2002, the European
Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC), a European Union watchdog,
released a report entitled "Summary report on Islamophobia in the EU after 11
September 2001", which described an increase in Islamophobia-related incidents
in European member states post-9/11. Definitions. Etymology. The word
"Islamophobia" is a neologism formed from "Islam" and "-phobia". The compound
form "Islamo-" contains the thematic vowel "-o-", and is found in earlier
coinages such as "Islamo-Christian" from the 19th century. Runnymede trust. In
1996, the Runnymede Trust established the Commission on British Muslims and
Islamophobia, chaired by Professor Gordon Conway, the vice-chancellor of the
University of Sussex. Their report, Islamophobia: A Challenge for Us All, was
launched in November 1997 by the Home Secretary, Jack Straw. In the Runnymede
report, Islamophobia was defined by the trust as "an outlook or world-view
involving an unfounded dread and dislike of Muslims, which results in practices
of exclusion and discrimination." Later debate. Robin Richardson, an original
member of the Commission on British Muslims and Islamophobia, at a 2009
symposium on "Islamophobia and Religious Discrimination", said that "the
disadvantages of the term Islamophobia are significant" on seven different
grounds, including that it implies it is merely a "severe mental illness"
affecting "only a tiny minority of people"; that use of the term makes those to
whom it is applied "defensive and defiant" and absolves the user of "the
responsibility of trying to understand them" or trying to change their views;
that it implies that hostility to Muslims is divorced from factors such as skin
color, immigrant status, fear of fundamentalism, or political or economic
conflicts; that it conflates prejudice against Muslims in one's own country
with dislike of Muslims in countries with which the West is in conflict; that
it fails to distinguish between people who are against all religion from people
who dislike Islam specifically; and that the actual issue being described is
hostility to Muslims, "an ethno-religious identity within European countries",
rather than hostility to Islam. Nonetheless, he argued that the term is here to
stay, and that it is important to define it precisely. Johannes Kandel, in a
2006 comment wrote that Islamophobia "is a vague term which encompasses every
conceivable actual and imagined act of hostility against Muslims", and proceeds
to argue that 5 of the criteria put forward by The Runnymede trust are invalid.
Still, he recognises the term and phenomenon. As opposed to being a
psychological or individualistic phobia, according to professor of religion
Peter Gottschalk and Gabriel Greenberg, "Islamophobia" connotes a social
anxiety about Islam and Muslims. Racism. Diane Frost defines islamophobia as
anti-Muslim feeling and violence based on ‚Äúrace‚Äù and/or religion.
Islamophobia may also target people who have Muslim names, or have a look that
is associated with Muslims. According to Alan Johnson, Islamophobia sometimes
can be nothing more than xenophobia or racism "wrapped in religious terms."
Proposed alternatives. The concept of Islamophobia as formulated by Runnymede
was also criticized by professor Fred Halliday on several levels. He writes
that the target of hostility in the modern era is not Islam and its tenets as
much as it is Muslims, suggesting that a more accurate term would be "Anti-
Muslimism." He also states that strains and types of prejudice against Islam
and Muslims vary across different nations and cultures, which is not recognized
in the Runnymede analysis, which was specifically about Muslims in Britain.
Poole responds that many Islamophobic discourses attack what they perceive to
be Islam's tenets, while Miles and Brown write that Islamophobia is usually
based upon negative stereotypes about Islam which are then translated into
attacks on Muslims. They also argue that "the existence of different
‚ÄòIslamophobias‚Äô does not invalidate the concept of Islamophobia any more
than the existence of different racisms invalidates the concept of racism." In
a 2011 paper in "American Behavioral Scientist", Erik Bleich stated "there is
no widely accepted definition of Islamophobia that permits systematic
comparative and causal analysis", and advances "indiscriminate negative
attitudes or emotions directed at Islam or Muslims" as a possible solution to
this issue. In order to differentiate between prejudiced views of Islam and
secularly motivated criticism of Islam Roland Imhoff and Julia Recker
formulated the concept "islamoprejudice", which they subsequently
operationalised in an experiment. The experiment showed that their definition
provided a tool for accurate differentiation. Community operationalisation.
London School of Economics & Political Sciences Students‚Äô Union defines
islamophobia as "a form of racism expressed through the hatred or fear of
Islam, Muslims, or Islamic culture, and the stereotyping, demonisation or
harassment of Muslims, including but not limited to portraying Muslims as
barbarians or terrorists, or attacking the Qur‚Äôan as a manual of hatred".
Origins and causes. History of the term. For some, the Muslim is the natural
and irreconcilable enemy of the Christian and the European; Islam is the
negation of civilization, and barbarism, bad faith and cruelty are the best one
can expect from the Mohammedans. Furthermore, he notes that Quellien's work
draws heavily on the work of the French colonial department's 1902-06
administrator, who published a work in 1906, which to a great extent mirrors
John Esposito's "The Islamic Threat: Myth or Reality?". Richardson states that
the first English print usage was Edward Said's 1985 article "Orientalism
Reconsidered". Another early documented use of the word was by the American
news magazine "Insight on the News" in 1991, used to describe Russian
activities in Afghanistan, and this is the usage listed by the Oxford English
Dictionary. The term entered into common usage with the publication of the
Runnymede Trust's report in 1997. Kofi Annan asserted at a 2004 conference
entitled "Confronting Islamophobia" that the word Islamophobia had to be coined
in order to "take account of increasingly widespread bigotry". Contrasting
views on Islam. These "closed" views are contrasted, in the report, with "open"
views on Islam which, while founded on respect for Islam, permit legitimate
disagreement, dialogue and critique. According to Benn and Jawad, The Runnymede
Trust notes that anti-Muslim discourse is increasingly seen as respectable,
providing examples on how hostility towards Islam and Muslims is accepted as
normal, even among those who may actively challenge other prevalent forms of
discrimination. Identity politics. She views this as an ontological trap that
hinders the perception of culture as something "materially situated in the
living practices of the everyday, situated in time-space and not based in
abstract projections of what constitutes either a particular tradition or
culture." In some societies, Islamophobia has materialized due to the portrayal
of Islam and Muslims as the national "Other", where exclusion and
discrimination occurs on the basis of their religion and civilization which
differs with national tradition and identity. Examples include Pakistani and
Algerian migrants in Britain and France respectively. This sentiment, according
to Malcolm Brown and Robert Miles, significantly interacts with racism,
although Islamophobia itself is not racism. Brown and Miles write that another
feature of Islamophobic discourse is to amalgamate nationality (e.g. Arab),
religion (Islam), and politics (terrorism, fundamentalism)¬ ‚Äî while most
other religions are not associated with terrorism, or even "ethnic or national
distinctiveness." They feel that "many of the stereotypes and misinformation
that contribute to the articulation of Islamophobia are rooted in a particular
perception of Islam", such as the notion that Islam promotes terrorism¬ ‚Äî
especially prevalent after the September 11, 2001 attacks. The two-way
stereotyping resulting from Islamophobia has in some instances resulted in
mainstreaming of earlier controversial discourses, such as liberal attitudes
towards gender equality and homosexuals. Christina Ho has warned against
framing of such mainstreaming of gender equality in a colonial, paternal
discourse, arguing that this may undermine minority women's ability to speak
out about their concerns. Links to other ideologies. Recent scholarship
considers Islamophobia as a form of racism."Remaking multiculturalism after 7/
7", Tariq Modood, 29 September 2005 "A sociological comparison of anti-Semitism
and anti-Muslim sentiment in Britain", Nasar Meer, Tehseen Noorani [[The
Sociological Review, Volume 56, Issue 2, pages 195‚Äì219, May 2008] Anti-
Semitism and Islamophobia - new enemies, old patternsFighting anti-Muslim
racism: an interview with A. SivanandanDifferentiating Islamophobia:
Introducing a new scale to measure Islamoprejudice and Secular Islam Critique A
2007 article in "Journal of Sociology" defines Islamophobia as anti-Muslim
racism and a continuation of anti-Asian and anti-Arab racism. Similarly, John
Denham has drawn parallels between modern Islamophobia and the antisemitism of
the 1930s, so have Maud Olofsson, and Jan Hj√§rpe, among others. Matti Bunzl
has argued that there are important differences between islamophobia and
antisemitism. While antisemitism was a phenomenon closely connected to European
nation-building processes, he sees islamophobia as having the concern of
European civilization as its focal point. D√∏ving, on the other hand, maintains
that, at least in Norway, the islamophobic discourse has a clear national
element. In a reply to Bunzl, French scholar of Jewish history, Esther
Benbassa, agrees with him in that he draws a clear connection between modern
hostile and essentializing sentiments towards Muslims and historical
antisemitism. However, she argues against the use of the term "islamophobia",
since, in her opinion, it attracts unwarranted attention to an underlying
racist current. Some argue that Islamophobia is real but is just another form
of racism and does not require its own category. The head of the Media
Responsibility Institute in Erlangen, Sabine Schiffer, and researcher
Constantin Wagner, who also define Islamophobia as anti-Muslim racism, outline
additional similarities and differences between Islamophobia and antisemitism.
They point out the existence of equivalent notions such as "Judaisation/
Islamisation", and metaphors such as "a state within a state" are used in
relation to both Jews and Muslims. In addition, both discourses make use of,
among other rhetorical instruments, "religious imperatives" supposedly "proven"
by religious sources, and conspiracy theories. The differences between
Islamophobia and antisemitism consist of the nature of the perceived threats to
the "Christian West". Muslims are perceived as "inferior" and as a visible
"external threat", while on the other hand, Jews are perceived as "omnipotent"
and as an invisible "internal threat". However, Schiffer and Wagner also note
that there is a growing tendency to view Muslims as a privileged group that
constitute an "internal threat", and that this convergence between the two
discources makes "it more and more necessary to use findings from the study of
anti-Semitism to analyse Islamophobia". Schiffer and Wagner conclude, The
publication "Social Work and Minorities: European Perspectives" describes
Islamophobia as the new form of racism in Europe, arguing that "Islamophobia is
as much a form of racism as anti-semitism, a term more commonly encountered in
Europe as a sibling of racism, xenophobia and Intolerance." Edward Said
considers Islamophobia as it is evinced in Orientalism to be a trend in a more
general antisemitic Western tradition. Other note that there have been a
transition from anti-Asian and anti-Arab racism to anti-Muslim racism. While
some note a racialization of religion. According to a 2012 report by a UK anti-
racism group, counter-jihadist outfits in Europe and North America are becoming
more cohesive by forging alliances, with 190 groups now identified as promoting
an Islamophobic agenda. In "Islamophobia and its consequences on young people"
(p.¬ 6) Ingrid Ramberg writes "Whether it takes the shape of daily forms of
racism and discrimination or more violent forms, Islamophobia is a violation of
human rights and a threat to social cohesion.". Professor John Esposito of
Georgetown University calls islamophobia "the new anti-Semitism".
Multiculturalism. According to Gabrielle Maranci, the increasing Islamophobia
in the West is related to a rising repudiation of multiculturalism. Islam is
widely regarded as the most resistant culture against Western, democratic
values and its Judaeo-Christian heritage. Maranci concludes that "Islamophobia
is a ‚Äòphobia‚Äô of multiculturalism and the transruptive effect that Islam
can have in Europe and the West through transcultural processes." Media.
According to Elizabeth Poole in the "Encyclopedia of Race and Ethnic studies",
the media has been criticized for perpetrating Islamophobia. She cites a case
study examining a sample of articles in the British press from between 1994 and
2004, which concluded that Muslim viewpoints were underrepresented and that
issues involving Muslims usually depicted them in a negative light. Such
portrayals, according to Poole, include the depiction of Islam and Muslims as a
threat to Western security and values. Benn and Jawad write that hostility
towards Islam and Muslims are "closely linked to media portrayals of Islam as
barbaric, irrational, primitive and sexist." Egorova and Tudor cite European
researchers in suggesting that expressions used in the media such as "Islamic
terrorism", "Islamic bombs" and "violent Islam" have resulted in a negative
perception of Islam. In 2008 Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting published a
study "Smearcasting, How Islamophobes Spread Bigotry, Fear and Misinformation."
The report cites several instances where mainstream or close to mainstream
journalists, authors and academics have made analyses that essentialize
negative traits as an inherent part of Muslims' moral makeup. The "Forum
Against Islamophobia and Racism" (FAIR) was also established, designed to
monitor coverage in the media and establish dialogue with media organizations.
Following the attacks of September 11, 2001, the Islam Awareness Week and the
"Best of British Islam Festival" were introduced to improve community relations
and raise awareness about Islam. OIC stated that they will launch a TV channel
to counter "Islamophobia". ‚ÄúIslamophobia Today‚Äù is a e-news magazine
dedicated to cover all important incidents related to 'Islamophobia' and anti-
Muslim sentiment. Trends. Islamophobia has become a topic of increasing
sociological and political importance. According to Benn and Jawad,
Islamophobia has increased since Ayatollah Khomeini's denouncement of Salman
Rushdie's "The Satanic Verses" and the September 11 attacks. Anthropologist
Steven Vertovec writes that the purported growth in Islamophobia may be
associated with increased Muslim presence in society and successes. He suggests
a circular model, where increased hostility towards Islam and Muslims results
in governmental countermeasures such as institutional guidelines and changes to
legislation, which itself may fuel further Islamophobia due to increased
accommodation for Muslims in public life. Vertovec concludes: "As the public
sphere shifts to provide a more prominent place for Muslims, Islamophobic
tendencies may amplify." Patel, Humphries, and Naik claim that "Islamophobia
has always been present in Western countries and cultures. In the last two
decades, it has become accentuated, explicit and extreme." However, Vertovec
states that some have observed that Islamophobia has not necessarily escalated
in the past decades, but that there has been increased public scrutiny of it.
According to Abduljalil Sajid, one of the members of the Runnymede Trust's
Commission on British Muslims and Islamophobia, "Islamophobias" have existed in
varying strains throughout history, with each version possessing its own
distinct features as well as similarities or adaptations from others. An
observatory report on Islamophobia by the Organisation of the Islamic
Conference similarly states that Islamophobia has existed for as long as Islam
itself. Assistant Professor Deepa Kumar writes that the modern-day demonization
of Arabs and Muslims by US politicians and others is racist and Islamophobic,
and employed in support of an unjust war. About the public impact of this
rhetoric, she says that "One of the consequences of the relentless attacks on
Islam and Muslims by politicians and the media is that Islamophobic sentiment
is on the rise." She also chides some "people on the left" for using the same
"Islamophobic logic as the Bush regime". She concludes with the statement "At
times like this, people of conscience need to organize and speak out against
Islamophobia." The writer and scholar on religion Reza Aslan have said that
"Islamophobia has become so mainstream in this country that Americans have been
trained to expect violence against Muslims¬ ‚Äî not excuse it, but expect it"
Ziauddin Sardar, an Islamic scholar, writes in "The New Statesman" that
Islamophobia is a widespread European phenomenon, so widespread that he asks
whether Muslims will be victims of the next pogroms. He writes that each
country has its anti-Muslim extremists, citing Jean-Marie Le Pen in France; Pim
Fortuyn in the Netherlands; and Philippe Van der Sande of Vlaams Blok, a
Flemish nationalist party in Belgium. Filip Dewinter, the leader of the
nationalist Flemish "Vlaams Belang" has said that his party is "Islamophobic."
He said: "Yes, we are afraid of Islam. The Islamisation of Europe is a
frightening thing." Sardar argues that Europe is "post-colonial, but
ambivalent." Minorities are regarded as acceptable as an underclass of menial
workers, but if they want to be upwardly mobile, as Sardar says young Muslims
do, the prejudice rises to the surface. Wolfram Richter, professor of economics
at Dortmund University of Technology, told Sardar: "I am afraid we have not
learned from our history. My main fear is that what we did to Jews we may now
do to Muslims. The next holocaust would be against Muslims." Bryan Fischer (the
Director of Issues Analysis for the American Family Association (AFA)) and
blogger Pamela Geller are examples of people who deny the concept of
"Islamophobia" and say it is "Islamorealism". Geller has sponsored billboards
in New York train stations under the banner of what she called "Islamorealism"
that claimed that there were 19250 terrorist attacks by Muslims since 9/11 (to
August 2012.) Residents of the neighborhood "denounced" the billboards. EUMC
reports. The largest project monitoring Islamophobia was undertaken following
9/11 by the EU watchdog, European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia
(EUMC). Their May 2002 report "Summary report on Islamophobia in the EU after
11 September 2001", written by Chris Allen and Jorgen S. Nielsen of the
University of Birmingham, was based on 75 reports¬ ‚Äî 15 from each EU member
nation. The report highlighted the regularity with which ordinary Muslims
became targets for abusive and sometimes violent retaliatory attacks after 9/
11. Despite localized differences within each member nation, the recurrence of
attacks on recognizable and visible traits of Islam and Muslims was the
report's most significant finding. Incidents consisted of verbal abuse, blaming
all Muslims for terrorism, forcibly removing women's hijabs, spitting on
Muslims, calling children "Usama", and random assaults. Muslims have been
hospitalized and on one occasion paralyzed. The report also discussed the
portrayal of Muslims in the media. Inherent negativity, stereotypical images,
fantastical representations, and exaggerated caricatures were all identified.
The report concluded that "a greater receptivity towards anti-Muslim and other
xenophobic ideas and sentiments has, and may well continue, to become more
tolerated." The EUMC has since released a number of publications related to
Islamophobia, including "The Fight against Antisemitism and Islamophobia:
Bringing Communities together (European Round Tables Meetings)" (2003) and
"Muslims in the European Union: Discrimination and Islamophobia" (2006).
Criticism of concept and use. Although the term is widely recognized and used,
the use of the term, its construction and the concept itself have been widely
criticized. Roland Imhoff and Julia Recker write that "... few concepts have
been debated as heatedly over the last ten years as the term Islamophobia."
Other studies report similar widespread challenges in the use and meaning of
the term. Academic debate. Paul Jackson, in a critical study of the anti-
Islamic English Defence League, argues that the term Islamophobia creates a
stereotype where ‚Äúany criticism of Muslim societies be dismissed ...‚Äù The
term feeds ‚Äúa language of polarised polemics ... to close down discussion on
genuine areas of criticism ...‚Äù Consequently, the term is ‚Äúlosing much its
analytical value". Political polemics. Other critics argue that the term
conflates criticism of "Islamic totalitarianism" with hatred of Muslims. In the
wake of the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy, a group of 12
writers, including novelist Salman Rushdie, signed a manifesto entitled in the
French weekly satirical newspaper "Charlie Hebdo", warning against the use of
the term Islamophobia to prevent criticism of "Islamic totalitarianism".
Writing in the New Humanist, philosopher Piers Benn suggests that people who
fear the rise of Islamophobia foster an environment "not intellectually or
morally healthy", to the point that what he calls "Islamophobia-phobia" can
undermine "critical scrutiny of Islam as somehow impolite, or ignorant of the
religion's true nature." Alan Posener and Alan Johnson have written that, while
the idea of Islamophobia is sometimes misused, those who claim that hatred of
Muslims is justified as opposition to Islamism actually undermine the struggle
against Islamism. Roger Kimball argues that the word ‚ÄúIslamophobia‚Äù is
inherently a prohibition or fear of criticizing of radical Islam. According to
Pascal Bruckner, the term was invented by Iranian fundamentalists in the late
1970s analogous to "xenophobia" in order to denounce what he feels is
legitimate criticism of Islam as racism. The author Sam Harris has called
islamophobia an invented psychological disorder.
