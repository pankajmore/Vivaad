Dorje Shugden controversy A controversy arose in the late 1970s when the
Fourteenth Dalai Lama started to speak out against the propitiation of Dorje
Shugden, which has intensified since 1996 when he issued an "explicit ban",
suppressing the practice within the Tibetan exile community. Dorje Shugden is a
Dharma Protector of the Sakya and Gelug traditions, who has been worshipped for
over three hundred years. However, this Dharma Protector's precise nature as
either an "enlightened being" or a "worldly being" has been the subject of
debate among some adherents of Tibetan Buddhism since his appearance in the
17th century. Overview of the controversy. The practice of Dorje Shugden (i.e.
different forms of worship and specific meditation techniques) began at the
time of the Fifth Dalai Lama Lobsang Gyatso (1617‚Äì1682 AD). Those who have
followed the practice of Dorje Shugden most recently in the 20th and 21st
centuries include the majority of the most famous Gelug teachers, including
Pabongka Rinpoche, Ling Rinpoche (senior tutor of the current, 14th Dalai
Lama), Trijang Rinpoche (junior tutor of the Dalai Lama), Zong Rinpoche,
Gangchen Rinpoche, Gonsar Rinpoche, Dagom Rinpoche, Lama Yeshe, Geshe Kelsang
Gyatso, Lama Zopa, Kundeling Rinpoche, Domo Geshe Rinpoche, and Trijang
Chocktrul Rinpoche. Trijang Rinpoche, the root Guru of the 14th Dalai Lama,
introduced the Dorje Shugden practice to the Dalai Lama in 1959 prior to the
Chinese takeover. The Dalai Lama carried out the practice in private as well as
encouraging it in Gelug monasteries. Some twenty years later, the Dalai Lama
got involved in a "bitter dispute" with his teacher by stating that the
practice is in conflict with the state protector Pehar and with the main
protective goddess of the Gelug tradition and the Tibetan people, Palden Lhamo.
He also stated that the practice was in conflict with his eclectic religious
approach as well as his political responsibilities. von Br√ºck, Michael (2001).

"Charisma and Canon: Essays on the Religious History of the Indian
Subcontinent". New Delhi: Oxford University Press. p. 345. According to von
Br√ºck, after examining Dorje Shugden based on three methodological
devices‚Äîhistorical evidence, political reason, and spiritual insight‚Äîthe
Dalai Lama changed his view and now considers Dorje Shugden to be a worldly
spirit. Von Br√ºck concludes: "However, in spite of these arguments, opposition
against this interpretation of the Dalai Lama and the exile government is still
strong on two grounds: the truthfulness and commitments to one's root teacher,
and religious freedom." "The Charter of Tibetans in-Exile", Article 10,

far more complex than it appears at its surface. Both sides offer seemingly
convincing arguments in favor of their respective points of view." History.
1970s - The Yellow Book. The controversy surfaced within the Tibetan exile
community during the 1970s. In 1973, Zemey Rinpoche published the "Yellow
Book", which included cautionary tales passed down by Pabongkha Rinpoche and
Trijang Rinpoche of 23 members of the Gelugpa sect who also practiced Nyingma
teachings and were supposedly "killed" by Shugden. The "Yellow Book" (so called
because of the color of its cover) was actually entitled "Thunder of the
Stirring Black Cloud: The Oral Transmission of the Intelligent Father". It was
written by Dzeme Tulku Lobsang Palden (1927‚Äì1996) of Ganden Shartse College
and published in 1974 by Chophel Legden in Delhi. This book claims to be a
record of stories told to the Dzeme Rinpoche by his guru, Trijang Rinpoche,
about how Dorje Shugden punished various Geluk and Nyingma lamas and others who
"corrupted the pure Geluk teachings," mainly by studying Nyingma teachings.
According to Mumford, Dorje Shugden is "extremely popular, but held in awe and
feared among Tibetans because he is highly punitive." Georges Dreyfus remarks
that the sectarian elements of the "Yellow Book" were not unusual and do not
"justify or explain the Dalai Lama's strong reaction." Instead, he traces back
the conflict more on the exclusive/inclusive approach and maintain that to
understand the Dalai Lama's point of view one has to consider the complex
ritual basis for the institution of the Dalai Lamas, which was developed by the
Great Fifth and rests upon "an eclectic religious basis in which elements
associated with the Nyingma tradition combine with an overall Gelug
orientation." This involves the promotion and practices of the Nyingma school.
Kay reminds us that "when traditions come into conflict, religious and
philosophical differences are often markers of disputes that are primarily
economic, material and political in nature. The 14th Dalai Lama started to
encourage the devotion to Padmasambhava, for the supposed purpose of unifying
the Tibetans, and "to protect Tibetans from danger". this dispute the Dalai
Lama's position does not stem from his Buddhist modernism and from a desire to
develop a modern nationalism, but from his commitment to another protector,
Nechung, who is said to resent Shukden. Thus, this dispute is not between
followers of a traditional popular cult and a modernist reformer who tries to
discredit this cult by appealing to modern criteria of rationality. Rather, it
is between two traditional or clan-based interpretations of the Geluk
tradition, that of Shukden's followers who want to set the Geluk tradition
apart from others, and the Dalai Lama's more eclectic vision. The fact that the
former may be more exclusivistic and that the latter may be more open does not
entail that they can be interpreted adequately through the traditional/modern
opposition. Various Shugden supporters assert that there was no factionalism
before the ban, and that it is the Dalai Lama who is being intolerant and
adhering to a theocratic model of government by banning their 400-year old
religious practice. 1996-1998. Dalai Lama, direct quote in Chhaya, Mayank

community, the dispute over Dorje Shugden developed international dimensions
that same year, when the British-based New Kadampa Tradition (NKT) began to
publicly oppose the Dalai Lama's position. Geshe Kelsang Gyatso, founder of the
New Kadampa Tradition, was a devotee of Shugden, and the nephew of a man who
had previously served as a medium for Shugden in Tibetan refugee communities.
Unlike other Gelug teachers, some of whom privately worshiped Shugden but did
not teach the practice to their Western students, Gyatso made Shugden practices
central to the teachings he imparted to non-Tibetan students in England and
abroad. When the Dalai Lama visited England later in the summer of 1996,
members of the New Kadampa tradition staged pickets outside venues where the
Dalai Lama was speaking, holding placards accusing the Dalai Lama of repressing
religious freedom. At the time, the NKT was the largest Buddhist organization
in the United Kingdom. Gyatso also founded the Shugden Supporters Community
(SSC), which distributed press releases to news outlets covering the Dalai
Lama's trip to England. The SSC also initiated a letter-writing campaign to
petition the British Home Secretary to revoke the Dalai Lama's visa. In August
1996, Sera Je monastery in India formally expelled Kelsang Gyatso, citing his
opposition to the Dalai Lama. The NKT claimed that the Dalai Lama's remarks had
inspired the harassment of Dorje Shugden worshippers among the Tibetan exile
community in India. Martin Mills, a lecturer in Religious Studies at the
University of Aberdeen, observed while in India that those who did not worship
Dorje Shugden seemed to feel that they should "endeavor to eradicate its
practice amongst their peers, neighbors and co-workers "as an act of loyalty to
the Dalai Lama"." The alleged abuses included searches of the homes and temples
of Shugden devotees, and the destruction of images of Dorje Shugden. In 1996,
the TGIE began a campaign to "subdue Dorje Shugden propitiation amongst
government employees and Gelug monasteries." Speaking to the press in England,
the SSC therefore stated that Shugden worshippers had been dismissed from their
jobs and expelled from monasteries. The numerous denials on the part of TGIE
officials between 1996 and 1998 of any kind of "ban" on Dorje Shugden practice
were "clearly" and "in all probability simply disingenuous," according to
Martin Mills. Chandler adds that "despite the government's insistence that the
Dalai Lama's decree does not constitute a "ban," it is important to note that
those who choose to worship Shugden against the wishes of the Dalai Lama and
mainstream Tibetan society become virtual outcasts." A Swiss TV documentary
made in 1997 paints an even grimmer picture. The documentary shows evidence of
violence and even death threats towards Dorje Shugden practitioners with wanted
posters of Dorje Shugden adherents being posted in Dharamsala, encouraging
violence towards practitioners. After protests from viewers and especially the
Tibetan exile community in Switzerland, the channel broadcast another
documentary in which it painted a more balanced picture, retracting some of the
statements and impressions left by the first documentary (e.g. the existence of
wanted posters). According to Sara Chamberlain in the New Internationalist, in
1996 the Dalai Lama announced that worship of Dorje Shugden was banned and
explained that the Tibetan state oracle, Nechung, had advised him that the
deity was a threat to his personal safety and the future of Tibet. The Dalai
Lama stated in 1996: "All final decisions have been concluded only through
divination." Thus, the belief that Dorje Shugden is a threat to the Dalai Lama
and to Tibet is directly attributable to an oracle in a trance. Yet the 14th
Dalai Lama has gone on record saying that oracles have "nothing to do with
Buddhism...they should be looked upon as a manifestation of popular
superstition." He was also quoted in 1971 saying: Prince Peter of Greece and
Denmark, "Tibetan Oracles," in "Himalayan Anthropology, The Indo-Tibetan
Interface" by James F. Fisher (The Hague: Mouton Publishers, 1978), 287 The
Nechung oracle has a history of false prophecies, including the repeated
prophecy that Tibet would gain independence within a few years and also
contributed toward the bungling surrounding the recognition of the
reincarnation of the Panchen Lama. Fourteenth Dalai Lama, "Talk at Sera
Monastery", 1980. The Dalai Lama also mentions making decisions by using
oracles, dream and divination by dough-balls in "A Talk Concerning Shugden
Practice", July 13, 1978, from "An Anthology of Talks Given by His Holiness The
Dalai Lama Concerning Reliance Upon the Dharma Protectors" (LTWA, Dharamsala).
In India, some protests and opposition were organised by the Dorje Shugden
Religious and Charitable Society with the support of the SSC. In, 1996 the SSC
attempted to obtain a statement from Amnesty International (AI) that the TGIE
(specifically the 14th Dalai Lama) had violated human rights. However, the AI
replied that the SSC's allegations were as yet unsubstantiated. Two years
later, the AI stated in an official press release that complaints by Shugden
practitioners fell outside its purview of "grave violations of fundamental
human rights" (such as torture, the death penalty, extrajudicial executions,
arbitrary detention or imprisonment, or unfair trials), adding that "while
recognizing that a spiritual debate can be contentious, cannot become involved
in debate on spiritual issues." In itself, the nuanced statement neither
asserted nor denied the validity of the claims made against the TGIE, just that
they were not actionable according to AI's mandate. While the AI report
effectively exonerated the TGIE of human rights abuses, Jane Ardley comments
that the Dalai Lama "was" at fault for using his political authority to
infringe upon others' religious freedom, saying that "While the Dalai Lama's
stated concern, that worship of the deity threatened the Tibetan struggle, is
entirely valid from a political perspective, this was not cause enough to ban
it as a religious practice... The Dalai Lama used his political authority to
deal with what was and should have remained a purely religious issue." 2008-
present. The Dalai Lama has recently stated: "I have meditated and considered
(my decision to put aside the Shugden) at length in my soul and spirit before
coming to the right decision‚Äù and continued: "People have killed, lied,
fought each other and set things alight in the name of this deity. These monks
must be expelled from all monasteries. If they are not happy, you can tell them
that the Dalai Lama himself asked that this be done, and it is very urgent",
and "Recently monasteries have fearlessly expelled Shugden monks where needed.
I fully support their actions. I praise them. If monasteries find taking action
hard, tell them the Dalai Lama is responsible for this." The opening address of
the fifth session of the Tibetan Parliament in Exile (TPiE), which began on
March 4, 2008, was delivered by Karma Chophel. According to the official
website of the TGIE, he lauded the bold initiative of Tibetan monastic
communities in their resolve to end the Dolgyal (Shugden) worship, following
the long life offering to the Dalai Lama held at Drepung monastery in south
India in February. "This session will present motions to strengthen the present
resolution adopted by the TPiE against the propitiation of Shugden," he added.
Critics of the ban on the practice of Dorje Shugden say that it has caused a
large rift in the Tibetan community and is increasing disharmony in the Tibetan
diaspora. On April 22, 2008, the newly-founded Western Shugden Society (WSS)
began a campaign directed at the 14th Dalai Lama, picketing the venues where he
was to appear around the world and claiming that he is "banning them from
practicing their own lineage of Buddhism". The WSS claims that the Dalai Lama
and the TGIE have not responded to any of their attempts to dialogue on the
subject and supporters say that the TGIE have simply discredited the
opposition. Sara Chamberlain reported that the TGIE will not employ those
worshipping Dorje Shugden, keeping a blacklist of those who do. The TGIE is
also accused of labeling Shugden supporters as "terrorists," as reported by Al
Jazeera: "In the Tibetan refugee camps, Shugden worshippers have been turned
away from jobs, shops and schools. Posters with the message 'no Shugden
followers allowed' cover hospital and shop fronts." Because of perceived
religious discrimination, the founder of Kundeling Monastery, Lobsang Yeshe,
who lives in South India, has filed a complaint against the Dalai Lama at the
Indian High Court on the grounds of religious persecution. The prosecuting
lawyer, Shree Sanjay Jain, argues that when the Dalai Lama excommunicates Dorje
Shugden worshippers from Buddhist society, "then it is discrimination of the
worst kind." The TGIE accuses Lobsang Yeshe of being paid by the Chinese and
state that he has visited China at least twice. He however denies working for
the Chinese, but does confirm that he has Chinese friends and he praises the
Chinese "for what they are doing in Tibet," claiming that if Tibetans who
followed Dorje Shugden had to live under the Dalai Lama in Tibet, they "would
have possibly been crucified." Views on the conflict. According to the Dalai
Lama and the Tibetan government in exile. According to the Dolgyal Research
Committee, instituted by the Tibetan government in exile (TGIE), prominent
opponents to the practice have included not only the 5th, 13th and current
Dalai Lamas but also the 5th and 8th Panchen Lamas, Dzongsar Khyentse Chokyi
Lodro, the 14th and 16th Karmapas among others. According to Shugden
supporters. The claims of the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan government in exile
(TGIE) are denied by the followers of Dorje Shugden. They claim, that for
example, in 1921 the 13th Dalai Lama's biography refers to Dorje Shugden as an
enlightened Protector (jam mgon bstan srung pa) and explains that the 13th
Dalai Lama subsequently restored the Potala and Ganden stupas as an offering to
him. According to Shugden adherents, the Fifth Dalai Lama started off in
opposition but then changed his mind. As further evidence of their view they
state the example of Phelgye Ling monastery that was transformed to a Gelug
monastery by the 5th Dalai Lama, who gave the monastery a statue (about 20¬ cm
high) of Dorje Shugden riding on a black horse, which still exists in the
monastery in Kathmandu. "Music Delighting the Ocean of Protectors" (1967) by
Kyabje Trijang Dorje Chang. p. 9. retrieved 2008-12-07 This view is also held
by other Gelug Lamas past and present who are or were considered great masters,
including: Kyabje Pabongka Rinpoche (root Guru of many highly regarded Gelug
Lamas of the early 20th century), Kyabje Trijang Rinpoche (junior tutor of the
14th Dalai Lama). Among those who practised Shugden in the Gelug school were
not only the Dalai Lama but also Geshe Rabten, Kyabje Zong Rinpoche, Lama Yeshe
(founder of the FPMT), Geshe Kelsang Gyatso (founder of the NKT) and Tomo Geshe
Rinpoche. It is also said that some of the Panchen Lamas (e.g. the 9th and
10th) practised Shugden, as does the current Chinese-appointed Panchen Lama,
Gyenkyen Norbu (the current Panchen Lama as recognized by the Dalai Lama and
most Tibetans, Gedun Choekyi Nyima, has been a prisoner of the People's
Republic of China for fifteen years; he is the world's youngest political
prisoner). Trijang Rinpoche claims that the view that Dorje Shugden is an
emanation of Manjushri has also been held by the Fifth Dalai Lama and the
Eleventh Dalai Lama. According to Trijang Rinpoche, the Eleventh Dalai Lama
"enthroned Gyalchen Dorje Shugden as the principal protector of the Yellow Hat
teachings." Views of non-Gelugpa Tibetan Buddhists. Dorje Shugden has
traditionally been regarded as a protector especially of the Gelugpa tradition.
The other schools of Tibetan Buddhism have therefore usually not worshipped him
or even, in the historical context of (political) rivalry, have seen him as a
potential threat. Sakya Trizin, head of the Sakya lineage of Tibetan Buddhism,
notes that at one time followers of his school did make offerings to Shugden
but that, in this context, Shugden was regarded as a worldly deity. He also
mentions two Lamas of pre-occupation Tibet, Dorjechang Jamyang Khyentse Chokyi
Lodro and Ngor Kangchen Dorjechang, who limited the practice in their
monasteries, confirming the existence of the practice within that tradition up
to that time. Palpung Tai Situ Rinpoche, one of the most important Lamas in the
Karma Kagyu tradition has said that the practice of Shugden "causes fear." He
adds the practice is considered to create obstacles to spiritual practice.
Mumford, Stan. "Himalayan dialogue: Tibetan lamas and Gurung shamans in Nepal",
p. 135. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1989. Chogyal Namkhai Norbu
claims that Shugden can cause devotees to become "nervous, confused and upset."
Minling Trichen Rinpoche, late head of the Nyingma tradition, said that
"Shugden is a ghost. We Nyingma practitioner do not follow him. We propagate
only those protectors that were bound by Padmasambhava. Shugden came after
Padmasambhava." Claims of violence/discrimination. Claims of violence/
discrimination against Shugden practitioners. David Van Biema reports:
"Addressing charges of shunning, threats and even physical abuse against
Shugdenites, American Dalai Lama adviser John Ackerly admits that 'there have
been cases of harassment,' all condemned by the High Lama." Dorje Shugden
worshippers say the ban and its implementation are in direct conflict with the
proposed constitution of a free Tibet, laid down by the Dalai Lama in 1963,
which states that all religious denominations are equal before the law, and
every Tibetan shall have the right to freedom of thought, conscience and
religion. But when Dorje Shugden worshippers challenged the ban on these
grounds, the TGIE responded: "Concepts like democracy and freedom of religion
are empty when it comes to the well-being of the Dalai Lama and the common
cause of Tibet." Lama Zopa of the FPMT explains that the main reason he stopped
the practice of Dorje Shugden himself and among his students was to support the
Dalai Lama's political efforts on behalf of Tibet. Brendan O'Neill argues that
the extreme idolization of the Dalai Lama by his followers only serves to
undermine democracy in a future free Tibet. Ursula Bernis commented that
second-guessing any pronouncement made by the Dalai Lama is "sacrilege among
religious Tibetans." The Dalai Lama claims that Dorje Shugden conflicts with
government-approved Dharma Protectors, so Al Jazeera asked one of the Tibetan
government's Members of Parliament, Tsultrim Tenzin, whether there had been any
parliamentary debate about Dorje Shugden. He replied that there had been no
debate simply because there was no opposition, adding "We do not have any doubt
about Dalai Lama's decisions. We do not think he is a human being. He's a
supreme human being and he is god, he is Avalokiteshvara." According to PK Dey,
a human-rights lawyer from Delhi, Dorje Shugden worshippers are suffering
harassment from the Dalai Lama's followers and his government, citing door-to-
door searches and wanted posters as examples. In 1998, Dey stated that he had
gathered 300 statements from Tibetans living throughout India who claimed to
have been subject to harassment or attack because of their worship of Dorje
Shugden. Shugden practitioners claim that they have been subjected to violence
while protesting the ban, both in the 1990s and in the present-day. They state
that in 1996, outside a monastery in southern India, a group of pro Dalai Lama
supporters (including monks) surrounded hundreds of monks who had gathered to
demonstrate against the Dalai Lama's ban on Dorje Shugden and threw stones and
bricks. Chryssides reported that "it is certainly true that, in July 1997, 200
of the Dalai Lama's followers physically attacked Shugden supporters." Deccan
Herald reported on Monday, September 11, 2000: What is wrong with Tibetan
society? Click on "Eye Witness Report" On July 17, 2008, a large mob of Dalai
Lama supporters, who had been attending one of the Dalai Lama's teachings at
the Radio City Music Hall in New York, clashed with Shugden protestors after
the event, spitting, screaming, and throwing money at them, indicating that
they believed that the Shugden protestors were paid by the Chinese government.
The New York riot police led the protestors away to safety. Jamphel Yeshe, the
President of the Dorje Shugden Society, stated that information about he and
his family were posted on "wanted posters" in Tibetan communities in India and
Nepal. Yeshe said in an interview that these posters had resulted in threats
being made against himself and his family. Wanted posters described people
believed to be Shugden leaders as the "top ten enemies of the state". The
posters were put up in monasteries, settlements and in Dharamsala by the TGIE.
In Clementown, India, "the house of a family of Shugden worshippers was stoned
and then firebombed." Shugden supporters say that in July 2008, wanted posters
of several monks involved in the WSS protests appeared in Queens, New York. Al
Jazeera reported about public shunning via posters of Dorje Shugden
practitioners displayed in public, adding "No Shugden worshipper has ever been
charged or investigated for terrorism, and yet the monks that continue to
worship Shugden remain victims of a campaign of name and shame." Dorje Shugden
practitioners have also received other warning and death threats since the
1990s. In October 2008, Radio Free Asia reported that some Tibetan monks had
been convicted by the Chinese government for fire-bombing the residence of a
Dorje Shugden practitioner, the Shugden deity being "regarded with suspicion by
those loyal to the Dalai Lama." The Tibetan exile government began saying in
2009 that the Dorje Shugden issue is not even religious, that it is entirely
political. Samdhong Tulku claimed that Shugden practitioners are tools being
used by the Chinese government and is quoted as saying "...it is not a question
of religion; it falls under the situation of politics only." Claims of
violence/discrimination against non-Shugden practitioners. A year after the
Dalai Lama's 1996 banning of the practice, Gen Lobsang Gyatso was murdered in
Dharmasala, along with two of his students. Gareth Sparham (1998). "Memoirs of
a Tibetan Lama". Ithaca, N.Y.: Snow Lion Publications, p. 321. Georges Dreyfus
adds that "Despite being hurt by the polemical attack, Tri-jang Rin-po-che made
it clear that violence was out of the question. Gradually, tempers cooled down
and the incident was forgotten‚Äîor so it seemed." After the murder, Indian
police interviewed several men they identified as worshippers of Dorje Shugden,
but, given the lack of any evidence, could not formally charge anyone. Though
no arrest was made, many within the CTA assumed that it had been carried out by
supporters of Dorje Shugden. The "Seattle Times" reported that: "The two men
suspected of stabbing their victims are believed to have fled India. Five
others, all linked to the Dorje Shugden Society in New Delhi, were questioned
for months about a possible conspiracy. No one has been charged." Geshe Kelsang
Gyatso denied the involvement of any of his followers in the murder, and
condemned the killings. The Tibetan government in exile maintains that the
murder of Lobsang Gyatso was carried out by followers of Dorje Shugden. In June
2007, the Times stated that Interpol had issued a Red notice to China for
extraditing two of the alleged killers. Court case concludes. The government of
India pointed out that this court has no territorial jurisdiction over a
dispute. As they are located in Dharamshala, the state government is to
investigate the allegations against the Dalai Lama and Tibetan government in
exile. Indian government does not recognize the so-called Tibetan government in
exile. It is further stated that worshippers of Dorje Shugden have a right to
freedom of religion as enshrined under Article 25 of the Constitution. The
court noted that the Shugden Society's harassment and maltreatment accusations
had not yet been lodged in a formal complaint to the local police authorities.
According to the website of the Central Tibetan Administration, Justice
Muralidhar's decision had the effect of "Closing the doors on the possibility
of similar complaints in the future," omitting the fact that "It is however
clarified that the dismissal of this petition will not preclude any individual
member or members of the Dorje Shugden Society to seek appropriate remedies as
may be available to them in law" before the police in Karnataka and its state
government. Claims of Chinese Government Involvement. It is claimed that the
Chinese Communist Government has used the Dorje Shugden issue to split the
Tibetan people and counter the influence of the 14th Dalai Lama. Although the
English version of one of the main Dorje Shugden website does not reveal any
linkage to the Chinese Government, the Chinese language version of the same
website claims that Manjusri, of whom Dorje Shugden was a reincarnation, was
originated from the Shanxi Province in the People's Republic of China, and
regularly reports news such as "Gyaincain Norbu received by the premier Wen
Jiabao".
