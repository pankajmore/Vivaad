Kashrut Kashrut (also kashruth or kashrus, ) is the set of Jewish dietary laws.
Food that may be consumed according to "halakha" (Jewish law) is termed kosher
in English, from the Ashkenazi pronunciation of the Hebrew term "kash√©r" (),
meaning "fit" (in this context, fit for consumption). Food that is not in
accordance with Jewish law is called "treif" ( or "treyf", derived from Hebrew
"trƒìf√°h"). Kosher can also refer to anything that is fit for use or correct
according to "halakha", such as a "hanukiyah" (candelabra for Hannukah), or a
"sukkah" (a Sukkot booth). The word "kosher" has become English vernacular, a
colloquialism meaning "proper", "legitimate", "genuine", "fair", or
"acceptable". Among the numerous laws that form part of "kashrut" are the
prohibitions on the consumption of unclean animals (such as pork, shellfish
(both Mollusca and Crustacea) and most insects, with the exception of crickets
and locusts), mixtures of meat and milk, and the commandment to slaughter
mammals and birds according to a process known as "shechita". Most of the basic
laws of "kashrut" are derived from the Torah's Books of Leviticus and
Deuteronomy. Their details and practical application, however, is set down in
the oral law (eventually codified in the Mishnah and Talmud) and elaborated on
in the later rabbinical literature. While the Torah does not state the
rationale for most "kashrut" laws, many reasons have been suggested, including
philosophical, practical and hygienic. Prohibited foods. The laws of "kashrut"
can be classified according to the origin of the prohibition (Biblical or
rabbinical) and whether the prohibition concerns the food itself or a mixture
of foods. Permitted and forbidden animals. Only meat from particular species is
permissible. Mammals that "both" chew their cud (ruminate) and have cloven
hooves can be kosher. Animals with one characteristic but not the other (the
camel, the hyrax and the hare because they have no cloven hooves, and the pig
because it does not ruminate) are specifically excluded (). In 2008, a
rabbinical ruling determined that giraffes and their milk are eligible to be
considered kosher. The giraffe has both split hooves and chews its cud,
characteristics of animals considered kosher. Findings from 2008 show that
giraffe milk curdles, meeting kosher standards. Although kosher, the giraffe is
not slaughtered today because the process would be very costly. Giraffes are
difficult to restrain, and their use for food could cause the species to become
endangered. Non-kosher birds are listed outright () but the exact "zoological"
references are disputed and some references refer to families of birds (24 are
mentioned). The Mishnah refers to four signs provided by the sages. First, a
"dores" (predatory bird) is not kosher. Additionally, kosher birds possess
three physical characteristics: an extra toe, a "zefek" (crop), and a
"korkoban" (gizzard) with a peelable lumen. However, individual Jews are barred
from merely applying these regulations alone; an established tradition
("masorah") is necessary to allow birds to be consumed, even if it can be
substantiated that they meet all four criteria. The only exception to this is
turkey. There was a time when certain authorities considered the signs enough,
so Jews started eating this bird without a masorah because it possesses all the
signs (simanim in Hebrew) and there is a place for this in Jewish law. In
Karaite Judaism, there are varying opinions on chicken. Early Karaites avoided
chicken because it was not specifically listed as permitted in the Torah.
Today, Hakham Meir Rekhavi has argued that chicken is kosher because it is a
member of the same order as quail, Galliformes. However, Hakham Avraham Qanai
argues that it is not kosher because it is not clear if it is listed in either
permitted or prohibited birds. He rebuts the argument using taxonomic
arguments, saying the Torah would not give two examples of birds from the same
order, doves and pigeons in Columbiformes. Fish must have fins and scales to be
kosher (). Shellfish and other non-fish water fauna are not kosher. Here is a
list of kosher species of fish. Insects are not kosher except for certain
species of kosher locust. Generally any animal that eats other animals, whether
they kill their food or eat carrion (), is not kosher, as well as any animal
that was partially eaten by other animals (Exodus 22:30/). Separation of meat
and milk. Meat and milk (or derivatives) cannot be mixed () in the sense that
meat and dairy products are not served at the same meal, served or cooked in
the same utensils, or stored together. Observant Jews have separate sets of
dishes, and sometimes different kitchens, for meat and milk, and wait anywhere
between one and six hours after eating meat before consuming milk products. The
"milchig" and "fleishig" utensils and dishes are the commonly referred to
Yiddish delineations between "dairy" and "meat" (lit. "milky" and "fleshy")
utensils and dishes respectively. Kosher slaughter. Mammals and fowl must be
slaughtered by a trained individual (a "shochet") using a special method of
slaughter, "shechita" (). Among other features, "shechita" slaughter severs the
jugular vein, carotid artery, esophagus and trachea in a single continuous
cutting movement with an unserrated, sharp knife. Failure of any of these
criteria renders the meat of the animal unsuitable. The body must be checked
after slaughter to confirm that the animal had no medical condition or defect
that would have caused it to die of its own accord within a year, which would
make the meat unsuitable. These conditions ("treifot") include 70 different
categories of injuries, diseases, and abnormalities whose presence renders the
animal non-kosher. It is forbidden to consume certain parts of the animal, such
as certain fats ("chelev") and the sciatic nerves from the legs. As much blood
as possible must be removed () through the "kashering" process; this is usually
done through soaking and salting the meat, but organs rich in blood (the liver)
are grilled over an open flame. Fish (and locusts, for those Sephardi Jews who
agree that they are both kosher and edible) must be killed before being eaten,
but no particular method has been specified in Jewish law. Kosher utensils.
Utensils used for non-kosher foods become non-kosher, and make even otherwise
kosher food prepared with them non-kosher. Some such utensils, depending on the
material they are made from, can be made suitable for preparing kosher food
again by immersion in boiling water or by the application of a blowtorch. Food
prepared by Jews in a manner that violates the "Shabbat" (Sabbath) may not be
eaten until the Shabbat is over. Passover laws. "Pesach" (Passover) has special
dietary rules, the most important of which is the prohibition on eating
leavened bread or derivatives of this ("chametz", ). Utensils used in preparing
and serving "chametz" are also forbidden on Passover unless they have been
cleansed ("kashering"). Observant Jews keep separate sets of meat and dairy
utensils for Passover use only. In addition, some groups follow various eating
restrictions on Passover that go beyond the rules of "kashrut", such as not
eating "gebrochts" or garlic. Produce of the Land of Israel. Biblical rules
control the use of agriculture produce. For produce grown in the Land of Israel
a modified version of the biblical tithes must be applied, including Terumat
HaMaaser, Maaser Rishon, Maaser Sheni, and Maaser Ani (untithed produce is
called "tevel"); the fruit of the first three years of a tree's growth or
replanting are forbidden for eating or any other use as "orlah"; produce grown
in the Land of Israel on the seventh year is Shviit, and unless managed
carefully is forbidden as a violation of the "Shmita" (Sabbatical Year). Some
rules of "kashrut" are not universally observed: the rule against eating
"chadash" (new grain) before the 16th of the month Nisan; many hold that this
rule does not apply outside the Land of Israel. Vegetables. Many vegetarian
restaurants and producers of vegetarian foods acquire a "hechsher", certifying
that a Rabbinical organization has approved their products as being kosher. The
hechsher usually certifies that certain vegetables have been checked for insect
infestation and steps have been taken to ensure that cooked food meets the
requirements of "bishul Yisrael". Vegetables such as lettuce, cabbage, broccoli
and cauliflower must be checked for insect infestation. The proper procedure
for inspecting and cleaning varies by species, growing conditions, and views of
individual rabbis. Pareve foods. Some processes convert a meat or dairy product
into a "pareve" (neither meat nor dairy) one. For example, rennet is sometimes
made from stomach linings, yet is acceptable for making kosher cheese, but such
cheeses might not be acceptable to some vegetarians, who would eat only cheese
made from a vegetarian rennet. The same applies to kosher gelatin, an animal
product, supposedly derived from kosher animal sources. Other gelatin-like
products from non-animal sources such as agar agar and carageenan are "pareve"
by nature. "Fish gelatin" is derived from fish and therefore (like all kosher
fish products) "pareve". Eggs are also considered "pareve" despite being an
animal product; Mayonnaise, for instance, is usually marked "pareve" despite by
definition containing egg. "Kashrut" has procedures by which equipment can be
cleaned of its previous non-kosher use, but that might be inadequate for those
with allergies, vegetarians, or adherents to other religious statutes. For
example, dairy manufacturing equipment can be cleaned well enough that the
rabbis grant "pareve" status to products manufactured with it. Nevertheless,
someone with a strong allergic sensitivity to dairy products might still react
to the dairy residue, and that is why some products that are legitimately
pareve carry "milk" warnings. Explanations. Philosophical explanations. Jewish
philosophy divides the 613 "mitzvot" into three groups‚Äîlaws that have a
rational explanation and would probably be enacted by most orderly societies
("mishpatim"), laws that are understood after being explained but would not be
legislated without the Torah's command ("edot"), and laws that do not have a
rational explanation ("chukim"). Some Jewish scholars say that "kashrut" should
be categorized as laws for which there is no particular explanation, since the
human mind is not always capable of understanding divine intentions. In this
line of thinking, the dietary laws were given as a demonstration of God's
authority and man must obey without asking why. However, Maimonides believed
that Jews were permitted to seek out reasons for the laws of the Torah. Some
theologians have said that the laws of "kashrut" are symbolic in character:
Kosher animals represent virtues, while non-kosher animals represent vices. The
1st century BCE Letter of Aristeas argues that the laws "have been given¬ ...
to awake pious thoughts and to form the character". This view reappears in the
prolix allegories of Philo of Alexandria and in the writings of early Christian
Church Fathers. This symbolism hypothesis features in the work of the 19th
century Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch. The Torah prohibits "seething the kid
(goat, sheep, calf) in its mother's milk". While the Bible does not provide a
reason, it has been suggested that the practice was perceived as cruel and
insensitive. Hasidism believes that everyday life is imbued with channels
connecting with Divinity, the "activation" of which it sees as helping the
Divine Presence to be drawn into the physical world; Hasidism argues that the
food laws are related to the way such channels, termed "sparks of holiness",
interact with various animals. According to the teachings of Hasidism, "sparks
of Holiness" are released whenever a Jew manipulates any object for a "holy
reason" (which includes eating); however, not all animal products are capable
of releasing their "sparks of holiness". The Hasidic argument is that animals
are imbued with signs that reveal the release of these sparks, and the signs
are expressed in the biblical categorization of ritually "clean" and ritually
"unclean"; According to Christian theologian Gordon J. Wenham, the purpose of
"kashrut" was to help Jews maintain a distinct and separate existence from
other peoples; he says that the effect of the laws was to prevent socialization
and intermarriage with non-Jews, preventing Jewish identity from being diluted.
Wenham argued that since the impact of the food laws was a public affair, this
would have enhanced Jewish attachment to them as a reminder of the distinct
status of Jews. Health explanations. There have been attempts to provide
empirical support for the view that Jewish food laws have an overarching health
benefit or purpose, one of the earliest being from Maimonides in his Guide for
the Perplexed. In 1953, David Macht, an Orthodox Jew and proponent of the
theory of biblical scientific foresight, conducted toxicity experiments on many
kinds of animals and fish. His experiment involved lupin seedlings being
supplied with extracts from the meat of various animals; Macht reported that in
100% of cases, extracts from ritually "unclean" meat inhibited the seedling's
growth more than that from ritually "clean" meats. At the same time, these
explanations are controversial. Scholar Lester L. Grabbe, writing in the
"Oxford Bible Commentary" on Leviticus, states that "explanation now almost
universally rejected is that the laws in this section [Leviticus 11‚Äì15 have
hygiene as their basis. Although some of the laws of ritual purity roughly
correspond to modern ideas of physical cleanliness, many of them have little to
do with hygiene. For example, there is no evidence that the 'unclean' animals
are intrinsically bad to eat or to be avoided in a Mediterranean climate, as is
sometimes asserted." Supervision and marketing. Hashgacha. Certain foods must
be prepared in whole or in part by Jews. This includes grape wine, certain
cooked foods ("bishul akum"), cheese ("gvinat akum"), and according to some
also butter ("chem'at akum"); dairy products (Hebrew: ◊ó◊ú◊ë ◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú chalav
Yisrael "milk of Israel"); and bread (Pat Yisrael). Product labeling standards.
Although reading the label of food products can identify obviously non-kosher
ingredients, some countries allow manufacturers to omit identification of
certain ingredients. Such "hidden" ingredients may include lubricants and
flavorings, among other additives; in some cases, for instance, the use of
"natural" flavorings, these ingredients are more likely to be derived from non-
kosher substances. Furthermore, certain products, such as fish, have a high
rate of mislabeling which may substitute a non-kosher fish into a package
labeled as a species of kosher fish. Producers of foods and food additives can
contact Jewish religious authorities to have their products certified as
"kosher": this would most likely involve a visit to the manufacturing
facilities by a committee from a rabbinic organization, rather than by an
individual rabbi, in order to inspect the production methods and contents, and
if everything is sufficiently "kosher" a certificate would be issued.
Manufacturers sometimes identify the products that have received such
certification by adding particular graphical symbols to the label. These
symbols are known in Judaism as "hechsherim". Due to differences in "kashrut"
standards held by different organizations, the "hechsheirim" of certain Jewish
authorities may at times be considered invalid by other Jewish authorities; the
certification marks of the various rabbis and organisations are too numerous to
list, but one of the most commonly used in the United States of America is that
of the Union of Orthodox Congregations, who use a "U" inside a circle,
symbolising the initials of "Orthodox Union". A single "K" is sometimes used as
a symbol for "kosher", but since many countries do not allow letters to be
trademarked (the method by which other symbols are protected from misuse), it
only indicates that the company producing the product claims that it is kosher.
Many of the certification symbols are accompanied by additional letters or
words to indicate the category of the product, according to Jewish law; the
categorisation may conflict with legal classifications, especially in the case
of food that Jewish law regards as "dairy", but legal classification does not.
In many cases constant supervision is required because, for various reasons,
such as changes in manufacturing processes, products that once were kosher may
cease to be so. For example, a kosher lubricating oil may be replaced by one
containing tallow, which many rabbinic authorities view as non-kosher. Such
changes are often co-ordinated with the supervising rabbi, or supervising
organisation, to ensure that new packaging does not suggest any "hechsher" or
"kashrut". In some cases, however, existing stocks of pre-printed labels with
the "hechsher" may continue to be used on the now non-kosher product. An active
"grapevine" among the Jewish community discusses which products are now
questionable, as well as products which have become kosher but whose labels
have yet to carry the "hechsher". Some newspapers and periodicals also discuss
"kashrut" products. Many coffee creamers currently sold in the United States
are labeled as "non-dairy", yet also have a "D" alongside their "hechsher",
which indicates a dairy status. This is because of an ingredient (usually
sodium caseinate), which is derived from milk. The rabbis categorize it as
dairy that cannot be mixed with meat, but the US government considers it to
lack the nutritional value of milk. Products labeled kosher-style are nonkosher
products that have characteristics of kosher foods, such as all-beef hot dogs,
or are flavored or prepared in a manner consistent with Ashkenazi practices,
like dill pickles. The designation usually refers to delicatessen items.
History of kosher marketing. In 1911, Procter & Gamble was the first company to
advertise that their product, Crisco, was kosher. Over the next two decades,
companies such as Lender's Bagels, Maxwell House, Manischewitz, and Empire
evolved and gave the kosher market more shelf space. In the 1960s, Hebrew
National hotdogs launched a "we answer to a higher authority" campaign to
appeal to Jews and non-Jews alike. From that point on, kosher became a symbol
for both quality and value. The kosher market quickly expanded, and with it
more opportunities for kosher products. According to Menachem Lubinsky, founder
of the Kosherfest trade fair, there may be as many as kosher consumers and in
sales of kosher products in the USA. Legal usage. Advertising standards laws in
many jurisdictions prohibit the use of the phrase "kosher" in a product's
labelling, unless it can be shown that the product conforms to Jewish dietary
laws; however, the legal qualifications for conforming to Jewish dietary laws
are often defined differently in different jurisdictions. For example, in some
places the law may require that a rabbi certify the "kashrut" nature, in others
the rules of "kosher" are fully defined in law, and in others still it is
sufficient that the manufacturer only believes that the product complies with
Jewish dietary regulations. In several cases, laws restricting the use of the
term "kosher" have later been determined to be illegal religious interference.
Society and culture. Adherence. About one-sixth of American Jews maintain the
kosher diet. Many Jews observe "kashrut" partially, by abstaining from pork or
shellfish, or not drinking milk with a meat dish. Some keep kosher at home but
will eat in a non-kosher restaurant. In 2012, one analysis of the specialty
food market in North America estimated that only 15% of Kosher consumers were
Jewish. A sizable non-Jewish segment of the population views kosher
certification as an indication of wholesomeness. Strict vegetarians, Muslims,
Hindus, and people with allergies to dairy foods, often consider the "kosher-
pareve" designation as an assurance that a food contains no animal-derived
ingredients, including milk and all of its derivatives, although the products
still might contain fish or eggs. Linguistics. ◊õ◊©◊® in Ancient Hebrew means,
be advantageous, proper, suitable, or succeed according to the Brown-Driver-
Briggs Hebrew and English Lexicon. In Modern Hebrew, it generally refers to
"kashrut" but can also sometimes mean "proper". By extension, "" has come to
mean "legitimate", "acceptable", "permissible", "genuine", and "authentic". For
example, the Babylonian Talmud uses "kosher" in the sense of "virtuous", when
referring to the D√£rayavahush I (known in English, via Latin, as "Darius") as
a "kosher king"; Darius, a Persian King, assisted in building the Second
Temple. The word "kosher" is also part of some common product names. Sometimes
it is used as an abbreviation of "koshering", meaning the process for making
something "kosher"; for example, "kosher salt" is a form of salt with
irregularly shaped crystals, making it particularly suitable for preparing meat
according to the rules of "kashrut", because the increased surface area of the
crystals absorbs blood more effectively. At other times it is used as a synonym
for "Jewish tradition"; for example, a "kosher dill" pickle is simply a pickle
made in the traditional manner of Jewish New York City pickle makers, using a
generous addition of garlic to the brine, and is not necessarily compliant with
the traditional Jewish food laws.
