Iglesia ni Cristo Iglesia ni Cristo (Tagalog for Church of Christ) also known
as INC, is the largest entirely indigenous Christian church in the Philippines,
and the largest religious organization that originated from the Philippine
Islands and the largest independent Christian Church in Asia. Due to a number
of similarities, some Protestant writers describe the INC's doctrines as
restorationist in outlook and theme. INC, however, does not formally consider
itself to be part of the Restoration Movement. Felix Y. Manalo officially
registered the church with the Philippine Government on July 27, 1914 and
because of this, most publications refer to him as the founder of the church.
However, the official doctrines of the church profess that Jesus Christ is the
founder of the INC and that Felix Manalo was the last messenger, sent by God to
re-establish the Christian Church to its true, pristine form because the
original church was apostatized. INC teaches that the apostate church is the
Roman Catholic Church, and proclaims that Catholic beliefs shared by most
Christians, such as the Trinity are proof of this apostasy. The church teaches
that the Trinity and the divinity of Jesus and of the Holy Spirit are not
biblical. , the Executive Minister of Iglesia ni Cristo is Eduardo V. Manalo,
the grandson of Felix Manalo. History. Felix Manalo, born on May 10, 1886 in
Taguig, Philippines, was baptized a Roman Catholic. In his teenage years,
Manalo became dissatisfied with Roman Catholic theology. According to the
National Historical Commission of the Philippines, the establishment of the
Philippine Independent Church or the Aglipayan Church was his major turning
point but Manalo remained uninterested since its doctrines were mainly
Catholic. He started seeking through various denominations, including the
Seventh-day Adventist Church. In 1904, he joined the Methodist Episcopal
Church, entered the Methodist seminary, and became a pastor for a while. Manalo
left the Methodist church in 1913, and associated himself with atheist and
agnostic peers. On November 1913, Manalo secluded himself with religious
literature and unused notebooks in a friend's house in Pasay, instructing
everyone in the house not to disturb him. He emerged out of seclusion three
days later with his new-found doctrines. Manalo, together with his wife, went
to Punta, Santa Ana, Manila on July 1914, and started preaching. He left the
congregation in the care of his first ordained minister, and returned to Taguig
to evangelize. In Taguig, he was ridiculed and stoned in his meetings with
locals. He was later able to baptize a few converts, including some of his
persecutors. He later registered his new-found religion as the Iglesia ni
Cristo (Tagalog for Church of Christ) on July 27, 1914 at the Bureau of
Commerce as a corporation sole with himself as the first executive minister.
Expansion followed as INC started building congregations in the provinces in
1916. The first three ministers were ordained in 1919. In 1922, the INC's first
schism, led by Teofilo Ora, one of INC's first ministers, resulted in the loss
of several congregations, along with their church buildings, in Bulacan and
Nueva Ecija. Ora founded "Iglesia Verdadero de Cristo" which was later changed
to Iglesia ng Dios kay Kristo Hesus. By 1924, the INC had about 3,000 to 5,000
adherents in 43 or 45 congregations in Manila and six nearby provinces. By
1936, the INC had 85,000 members. This figure grew to 200,000 by 1954. A Cebu
congregation was built in 1937‚Äîthe first to be established outside of Luzon,
and the first in the Visayas. The first mission to Mindanao was commissioned in
1946. Meanwhile, its first concrete chapel was built in Sampaloc, Manila in
1948. Adherents fleeing for the provinces away from Manila, where the Japanese
forces were concentrated during the World War II, were used for evangelization.
As Manalo's health began to fail in the 1950s, Era√±o Manalo started to take
leadership of the church. Felix Manalo died on April 12, 1963. The first
overseas INC mission was sent in 1968 on its 54th anniversary. The INC started
operating a radio station in 1969. In 1973, the church established a
congregation in Honolulu, Hawaii on July 27, and in San Francisco, California
(both in the United States). The Ministerial Institute of Development,
currently the New Era University College of Evangelical Ministry, was founded
in 1974 in Quiapo, Manila. It moved to its current location in Quezon City in
1978. As of 1995, it had 4,500 students and five extension schools in Bulacan,
Cavite, Laguna, Pampanga and Rizal. In 1971, the INC Central Office building
was built in Quezon City. Fifteen years later, the Central Temple was added in
the complex. The Tabernacle, a tent-like multipurpose building which can
accommodate up to 4,000 persons, was finished in 1989. The complex also
includes the New Era University, a higher-education institution run by the INC.
Era√±o Manalo died on August 31, 2009. His son, Eduardo V. Manalo, succeeded
him as executive minister upon his death. In September 2011 the INC bought 59
parcels of land in Scenic, South Dakota for approximately $700,000.00. Scenic
is a ghost town in western South Dakota. No plans for the land have been
revealed by the church. In February 28, 2012 the Iglesia Ni Cristo (INC) holds
simultaneous Grand Evangelical Missions (GEM) nationwide as part of its
campaign for the year 2012 for the intensive propagation of God‚Äôs words. One
of the 19 venues for the Grand Evangelical Mission is the Quirino Grandstand,
Rizal Park, Manila. The INC‚Äôs five ecclesiastical districts in Metro Manila,
along with the other districts in the provinces of Bulacan and the Calabarzon
participated in this event. GEM held at the following venues: Isabela Sports
Complex, Isabela; Jose V. Yap Sports and Recreational Complex, San Jose,
Tarlac; Gloria Town Plaza, Oriental Mindoro; Pili Freedom Sports Complex, Pili,
Camarines Sur; La Union National High School Sports Complex, San Fernando City,
La Union; Paglaum Sports Complex, Bacolod City; Cebu City Fuente Osmena;
Tacloban City Convention Center; Pagadian City Gym, Zamboanga del Sur;
Limketkai Center, Cagayan de Oro City; Davao Agro-Football Stadium, Davao City;
Gen. Santos City Gym; La Paz Plaza, Iloilo; Butuan City Sports Complex;
Odiongan Sports Complex, Odiongan, Romblon; Puerto Princesa Coliseum, Palawan;
Coron Gym, Palawan; and Sta. Cruz Plaza, Sta. Cruz, Marinduque. Architecture.
Iglesia ni Cristo church buildings (chapels) serve as places of worship and
other religious functions, are "vehicles for glorifying God." These are
described by "Culture and customs of the Philippines", a book published by
Greenwood Publishing Group, as structures "which employ exterior neo-Gothic
vertical support columns with tall narrow windows between, interlocking
trapezoids, and rosette motifs, as well as tower and spires." There are
multiple entrances leading to the main sanctuary, where males and females sit
on either side of the aisle facing a dais where sermons are made. The choir
loft is located behind the dais, and in larger churches, baptistry pools for
immersion baptism are located at the back of the church. Meanwhile, Fernando
Nakpil-Zialcita, an anthropologist from Ateneo de Manila University, said that
INC churches can be uniquely identified for "its exuberant use of fanciful
forms and ornaments a brilliant white facade whose silhouette is a cusped
Gothic arch or a flattened Saracenic arch." The distinctive spires represent
"the reaching out of the faithful to God." Churches were started to be built in
this style during the late 1940s and early 1950s with the first concrete chapel
built in Sampaloc, Manila in 1948. The Central Temple which opened in July 1984
can accommodate up to 7,000 persons, and cost about US$2 million. The Central
Temple features octagonal spires, "fine latticework" and ribbed windows. Recent
buildings are variations of Carlos A. Santos-Viola's designs on the Central
Temple. These are designed to accommodate 250 to 1,000 persons while larger
churches in Metro Manila and provincial capitals can accommodate up to 3,000
persons. Prominent architects, such as Juan Nakpil (a National Artist of the
Philippines for architecture) and Carlos Ra√∫l Villanueva, had been involved in
designing INC churches while the Engineering and Construction Department of
INC, established in 1971, oversees the uniformity in design of church
buildings. Uniforms. The uniform for deacons and deaconesses consists of a suit
(outside the Philippines) or Barong (in the Philippines) and a white dress
(outside the Philippines) or White Terno with Panuelo (in the Philippines)
respectively. The choir uniform consists of Jade green and cream robes abroad,
or plain cream robes (in the Philippines) and Cream Robes with Pine Green
Linings (for Central Temple Choir use only). Organization and administration.
Iglesia ni Cristo has had three executive ministers (), that lead the church
administration in overseeing the faith of the brethren. Bro. Eduardo V. Manalo,
as the current executive minister, serves as the church's leader, and, in this
capacity, manages the administration of the church. Along with the deputy
executive minister and other senior ministers, the executive minister forms the
Central Administration of Iglesia ni Cristo. All church ministers are male,
however, there are a large number of female church officials. Ministers are
encouraged to marry for the purpose of obeying the command to marry and
multiply. The Central Office in Quezon City is Iglesia ni Cristo's
headquarters. It was formerly located in Manila during its early years, then in
San Juan, and later in Makati before moving to its present site. It houses the
offices of INC's administration. Administration and ministerial work are
delegated into ecclesiastical districts (termed divisions prior to 1990) which
are led by district ministers (formerly, division ministers). Ecclesiastical
districts comprise 30 to 120 congregations (referred to as locales) on average.
The ecclesiastical district's range is generally a single province of the
Philippines; however, populous provinces often have more than one
ecclesiastical district. There were about 5,000 Iglesia ni Cristo locales in 96
countries in 2008. 200 of these congregations, including 150 in 39 U.S. states,
were outside the Philippines in 2001. All locales were directly managed by
Felix Manalo until 1924 when the first ecclesiastical district was organized in
Pampanga. Beliefs. Church. Adherents hold that Iglesia ni Cristo is the only
true church of Jesus Christ as restored by Felix Manalo. The church recognizes
Jesus Christ as the founder of the Church. Meanwhile, its reestablishment is
seen as the signal for the end of days. For example, its founding in July 27,
1914 coincides with the beginning of World War I. They believe that the church
was apostatized by the 1st or 4th century due to false teachings. The INC says
that this apostate church is the Roman Catholic Church. They believe that the
Iglesia ni Cristo is the fulfillment of the passage above while "east" refers
to the Philippines where the Church of Christ would be founded. The INC teaches
that its members constitute the "elect of God" and there is no salvation
outside the Iglesia ni Cristo. Faith alone is insufficient for salvation. The
Iglesia ni Cristo says that the official name of the true church is "Church of
Christ or Iglesia ni Cristo (in tagalog)". The two passages often cited by INC
to support this are Romans 16:16 ""Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the
churches of Christ greet you"" and the George Lamsa translation of Acts 20:28:
""Take heed therefore . . . to feed the church of Christ which he has purchased
with his blood"" Bible. Manalo concluded after his three-day seclusion that
"that the conflicting doctrines of various Christian groups could be resolved
only through a fresh examination of the Bible from a non-Western perspective."
The Iglesia ni Cristo believes in the infallibility of the Bible, which is its
sole source of authority. God the Father, Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit. The
Iglesia ni Cristo believes that God the Father is the only true God. The church
believes that God is omnipotent, and that He created all, including Jesus
Christ, the Son. Meanwhile, the Holy Spirit is the power sent by God in the
name of Jesus. The Holy Spirit is in the INC ministers giving them the
exclusive ability to interpret the Bible correctly. Thus, the INC rejects the
trinity as a heresy. They believe that this position is attested by Jesus
Christ and the Apostles. The church believes that Jesus Christ is the mediator
between God the Father and humanity, and was created by God the Father. God him
to be without sin, and bestowed him the titles "Lord" and "Son of God". The
church sees Jesus as God's highest creation, and denies his divinity. Thus, INC
theology is classified as Arian by Robin A. Brace, a British apologist, and
Anne C. Harper, former director of publications of Gordon College in
Massachusetts, United States. Adherents profess Jesus' substitutionary role in
the redemption of humankind. He is believed to have been "foreordained before
the foundation of the world", and sent by God "to deal with sin". Members "are
saved by Christ's blood" who died because of his "self-sacrificing love". Felix
Manalo. Felix Manalo is said to be the restorer of the church of Christ, and
"God's last messenger"(sugo in Tagalog). INC divides time into three periods:
the era of the patriarchs (from creation to the birth of Moses), the era of the
prophets (from the birth of Moses to the birth of Jesus), and the Christian era
(from the birth of Jesus to the Last Judgment). Adherents believe him to be the
last messenger of God in the Christian Era. The INC says that Manalo is the
"angel from the east", mentioned in Revelation 7:1‚Äì3 who started the INC at
the same time that World War I broke out. This period of time according to INC
is referred to as the ends of the earth (cf Is 41:9-10; 43:5-6) the time when
the end of the world is near, even at the doors (cf. Mt. 24:3, 33), which began
with the outbreak of a war of global proportions (cf. Mt. 24:6-7) Felix Manalo
is from the Philippines, which they say is in the ‚Äòcenter‚Äô of the Far East.
The ‚Äòfour winds‚Äô in Revelation 7:1-3, they say refers to World War I and
the four angels are the four leaders known as the big four(Woodrow Wilson,
Lloyd George, Georges Clemenceau, and Vittorio Orlando) who they say worked on
the prevention of the war. Manalo is also portrayed as the fulfillment of
several passages in Isaiah and other books of the Bible. Manalo's titles are
"ravenous bird from the east" (Isa. 46:11), "worm Jacob" (Ps. 22:6-7), "one
shepherd" (John 10:6)and "the last Elijah" (Mt.17:10-11; Mal.4:5) As the one
who established the INC, Manalo was the chief administrator, chief theologian
and spiritual leader of the church. As such, he was the ultimate authority in
all aspects of the church, and effectively "the foremost Biblical authority for
all humanity and the divinely designated leader of a reestablished church of
Christ in the modern world." His influence within the church caused people from
other religions to call INC and its members ""Iglesia ni Manalo"" (Tagalog for
Church of Manalo) and ""Manalistas"", respectively, labels INC members consider
as both pejoratives and blasphemous. Eschatology. Members believe that when a
person dies, his/her body and soul both die and go into the grave where both
would remain until the Second Coming of Christ. Upon his return, all dead
members of the Iglesia ni Cristo, including Manalo, would be resurrected to
join living INC members. They would be rewarded by living in the Holy City
together with God the Father, Christ, and Manalo. After 1,000 years, a second
resurrection would occur, and non-INC members will experience second death
which is the Lake of Fire or Dagat-dagatang Apoy (in Tagalog). Practices.
Worship and prayer. The church conducts regular worship services, one during
the week, and one during the weekend. It is conducted in the local languages
(for example, English, Tagalog and French). It involves singing of 2 extra
hymns and 3 hymns, prayers, preaching and offering, benediction, recessional
hymn which some observers, including Robert R. Reed, label as tithing. Both God
the Father and Jesus are worshiped. The ministers of every congregation in a
given worship service use the same sermon outline prepared by the executive
minister. Deacons and Deaconesses guide worshipers to their seats and collect
offerings. The choir wears robes while singing in the worship service the color
of the adult choir robe is green and white(abroad and central temple) and plain
cream robes in the Philippines, while children's is plain cream robes The
Singing of hymns is led by the locale's choir. The first hymnbook, termed as
"Himnario", which contained about 300 songs, was published in 1937. Children's
worship services are held every weekend. They use similar lessons as the
standard worship services taught using the Socratic method (question and
answer). The church teaches that willfully forsaking the worship service is a
grievous sin, thus members are expected to attend the congregational worship
services twice a week without fail. The church encourages its members to make
prayer a part of everyday life. Thus prayer before various activities, such as
taking meals and going to sleep, are commonly practiced. Prayers recited in
rote repetition are not observed. Evangelism. Since February 1939, the church
has been publishing "Pasugo" () in both Tagalog and English. As of 2010, the
God's Message Magazine also features a Spanish Section. Bro. Felix Manalo wrote
its first editorial where he stated the publication's purpose, including the
propagation of the faith. Issues contain articles which detail INC doctrines
and refute doctrines which it considers as heresy, such as the Trinity. It also
features information on church history, educational programs and missionary
achievements, including lists and photographs of newly dedicated chapels. It
had a monthly circulation of 235,000 copies in 2001. Brethren are encouraged to
help in missionary works, such as Bible studies and to distribute copies of the
God's Message Magazine (Pasugo). In the Philippines, radio and television
programs are produced, and they are broadcast on 1062 kHz DZEC-AM radio, DZEM
954¬ kHz, the Net 25 television station operated by Eagle Broadcasting
Corporation, the broadcast division of the Iglesia ni Cristo and INCTV, the
sister station to NET 25 and Iglesia Ni Cristo channel, also owned by the INC
and Iglesia ni Cristo TV broadcast on cable. In North America, a television
program called "The Message" is produced in the San Francisco Bay Area. It is
currently aired in the United States and Canada and some parts of Europe. Each
30-minute program is hosted by one of a panel of INC ministers, who share the
main beliefs of the Iglesia ni Cristo with a television audience. The INC use
to maintain an hour long time slot on The Filipino Channel and airs two among
many of its programs including the "INC Chronicles" and "Ang Tamang Daan". It
has since stopped and instead GEM-TV began broadcasting 24 hours a day, 7 days
a week on DirecTV channel 2068. Live streaming of INC Programming is now
available at www.incmedia.org Outreach. From the beginning, the INC has
continuously extended help not only to the well-being of local townspeople but
also to protect the environment through its various humanitarian services. The
INC has outreach programs, such as its ""Lingap sa Mamamayan (Filipino: Care
for the People)"", offering free medical and dental services, community
cleanups and tree planting projects. In California, Daly City twice declared a
week in July as ""Iglesia ni Cristo Week"" in recognition of the efforts of the
INC members in community service events such as community beautification
projects, blood drives, and food distribution sessions. Coinciding with the
67th anniversary of the local congregation in the Barangay of Dau, Mabalacat,
Pampanga, the INC launched a program called ""Vigorous Environmental Concern
for Mankind"" which included programs to support the ""clean and green""
programs of the local government. The INC conducted "Linis Bayan" (Filipino:
"Clean Town") and "Lingap sa Mamamayan" within the local area. They also host a
website for Iglesia Ni Cristo members to have an update of the past and present
activities of the Church. The website is also used by members to listen and
watch Christian Music Videos (CMVs). The CMVs are composed of original music
and hymns of Iglesia Ni Cristo composed by the INC members themselves. The
website has pictures of past activities of the Church, blogs, and every member
can share the happenings of their designated locales, and inspirational
messages and compositions which is also sometimes published in the magazine of
the Iglesia Ni Cristo which is the PASUGO or God's Message. There is also an
Online Live feed of the channel GEM-TV (Global Expansion Media) on the website.
Political involvement. INC members are noted for bloc voting in Philippine
elections, although INC has the biggest conversion turn-out, between 68 and 84
percent of its members voted for candidates endorsed by its leadership,
according to comprehensive surveys conducted by ABS-CBN. This is in part due to
their doctrine on unity. Some reports say that the INC can deliver 2 million
members of voting age, although pollsters believe the actual figure is closer
to between 1 million and 1.5 million. Others argue that the INC vote is only
significant in close-run elections, noting that some INC-supported candidates
lost in the election. Businessman Eduardo Cojuangco Jr. lost to Fidel Ramos in
the 1992 Philippine presidential election. Michael Defensor, Ralph Recto,
Vicente Sotto III in 2007 and Ruffy Biazon in 2010 were endorsed by INC but
lost in the senate election. INC endorsed Rafael Nantes and Jamie Eloise
Agbayani but lost in the 2010 Quezon and 2007 Pangasinan gubernatorial
elections respectively. Ever since former Philippine president Manuel L. Quezon
created a lasting friendship after asking Felix Manalo for advice, the INC has
been known for its strong political influence. Not all candidates in Philippine
politics however embraced support from INC. Diosdado Macapagal has refused
INC's support during his runs for Vice President in 1957, and re-election for
President in 1965 ‚Äì in which he lost to Ferdinand Marcos. In the 1969
presidential election, INC supported Senator Sergio Osme√±a Jr. earlier in the
campaign but has swung behind Marcos who won the election. The INC supported
Ferdinand E. Marcos until he was ousted in 1986. In 2002, the Philippine Center
for Investigative Journalism reported that INC leader, Bro. Era√±o Manalo
himself wanted to support Panfilo Lacson. Era√±o saw that Lacson will likely
succeed Estrada. This worried Arroyo during her 2001-2004 term as President.
But that did not prevent President Arroyo from courting the church. The church
eventually offered their support for Arroyo‚Äôs presidential campaign in the
2004 elections. Arroyo dismissed rumors that she paid off the INC to support
her candidacy. In an open letter to the INC which was read in all INC chapels
across the country, Mrs. Arroyo said ""I would never taint their (INC)
sincerity by offering money for it"". Newspaper reports say that the Philippine
Congress decision to uphold the decision on September 2005 rejecting the Arroyo
impeachment complaint over alleged election fraud and corruption was swayed
largely by INC influence. Behn Fer. Hortaleza Jr. says otherwise and wrote an
op-ed piece for "The Sun¬∑Star Pangasinan" stating that Representative Joey
Salceda "had wanted to pit the INC against the Catholic church by so timing the
congressman's 'news' with another expose on the bishops' receiving Pagcor "sin
money" for their projects." The support of the INC was reportedly sought out
for passage of the Reproductive Health and Population Development Act of 2008.
In 2008, the INC and the Catholic Church were again pitted against each other
when health advocate "RH Advocacy Network (RHAN)" sought the support of the INC
to counter the firm opposition of the Catholic Church and President Arroyo to
the bill. Representative Janette Garin of the first district of Iloilo said the
INC's stand could determine if the bill gets passed in the House of
Representatives. She said the opinion of the Iglesia ni Cristo is
‚Äúimportant‚Äù in determining the fate of House Bill 5043. On July 27, 2008 on
the occasion of its 94th Anniversary lawmakers, governors, mayors, councilors
and other government officials cited the meaningful role of the Iglesia ni
Cristo in Filipino society. Rep. Annie Susano of Quezon City's second district
where the INC's executive offices are located, along other government officials
said that the INC continues to contribute not only to the spiritual development
of the Filipino but also in shaping the country's destiny. Susano said INC also
plays a crucial role in improving the socio-economic condition of its followers
and other Filipinos, at home and abroad. A year before, on the same date,
President Arroyo declared July 27 of every year as "Iglesia Ni Cristo Day" to
enable millions of INC followers in the Philippines to observe the occasion
with fitting solemnity. President Arroyo‚Äôs proclamation was based on a
resolution of the House of Representatives authored by Rep. Annie Rosa L.
Susano. On July 8, 2009, Arroyo declared that July 27 of every year as "Iglesia
Ni Cristo Day" making it an official national working holiday. In 2010, Iglesia
ni Cristo has declared support for Noynoy Aquino and Mar Roxas for president
and vice president respectively. Aquino won the election but Roxas lost to
Jejomar Binay. In 2010, Iglesia ni Cristo withdrew their support from President
Noynoy Aquino. In 2011, the organization purchased Scenic, South Dakota, an
abandoned "ghost town" with a saloon, a roadside jail, and of surrounding land.
The church has not announced its plans for the property. Membership. According
to the April 2012 issue of PASUGO Magazine (p.¬ 11), the Demographics of the
Iglesia ni Cristo then was composed of 93 countries and 7 territories
comprising 110 races. As of the 2000 Philippine census by the National
Statistics Office, Iglesia ni Cristo had 1,762,845 members, making it the third
largest religious denomination in the Philippines after the Roman Catholic
Church and Islam, respectively. A 2009 estimate by Brace puts it between 4 to 9
million. The Iglesia ni Cristo does not publish official membership figures.
The majority of its members are Filipino ex-Catholics, while most non-Filipino
members converted prior to marrying Iglesia ni Cristo people. The earliest non-
Filipino converts were American soldiers stationed in the Philippines.
Membership is conferred through immersion baptism of adults. The church rejects
infant baptism. Newborn children of members are instead dedicated to God
through a Congregational Prayer, led by an ordained minister of the INC.
Members who are not living in accordance with the church's teachings may be
excommunicated or expelled from the Church, and thus lose salvation (as opposed
to the perseverance of the saints). Grounds include adultery, alcohol
intoxication, consumption of blood and marriage to members of other faiths.
Criticisms. The Iglesia ni Cristo has come under fierce criticism from
apologetics groups and other mainstream religions mainly due to disagreements
over their doctrines and beliefs regarding the interpretation of the Bible.
They have also been criticized by the Philippine Center for Investigative
Journalism (PCIJ) for their political influence. According to PCIJ, the INC's
use of its clout mirrors the way in which the Catholic Church has tried to
influence successive Philippine governments. Religious criticism. Karl Keating.
Karl Keating, the founder of Catholic Answers accused Jose Ventilacion, an INC
minister, of breaking an agreement in 1990 for a one-on-one debate made by the
two organizations in National City, California "(part 1, part 2)". Instead of a
one-on-one debate, Keating says that Ventilacion had three helpers assisting
him, and that "they" allegedly were shouting at him during the debate. The head
projector at the side of Mr. Ventilacion was not also in the agreement. Keating
views the church as being built on a set of ""anti-catholic"" doctrines, and
that their lessons, as well as their "God's Message" magazine are dedicated
more to debunking Catholic and Protestant beliefs and doctrines, although he
did reveal the extent of his studies concerning the church save for his own
account of the debate he had with Ventilacion. Catholicism and Protestantism
remain among the predominant religions in the Philippines especially in Luzon
and Visayas islands. Keating also states that the INC began as a Protestant
sect, comparing its doctrines with those of the American Campbellites saying it
"heavily borrowed" from the latter. Keating criticized the Iglesia ni Cristo
for teaching that the Whore of Babylon is the Roman Catholic Church and that
the Beast of Revelation is the Pope, a belief shared with some other Christian
religious organizations, and an assertion which the Catholic Church denies.
Keating says the this INC position is based on a Latin-language version of
gematria, in which numerical values of the letters in a name or phrase are
added to find a number with symbolic significance. When applied to an alleged
title of the Pope, Vicarius Filii Dei (Vicar of the Son of God), the resulting
number is 666, which is one of several alternative numbers known as the "Number
of the Beast." Keating says the Iglesia ni Cristo also claims that "Vicarius
Filii Dei" is engraved on the Pope's tiara. The INC's source for this claim is
a Seventh-day Adventist Church book. "Vicar of the Son of God" is not among the
many official titles traditionally used for popes, neither past nor present,
although Vicar of Jesus Christ one of the most prominent papal titles.
"Catholic Answers" rejects the Iglesia ni Cristo's interpretation of certain
Bible verses and use of some translations to support its doctrines. They also
criticized INC's use of the George Lamsa translation of Acts 20:28 as proof
that the true church is called "Church of Christ". They argue that it is not
based on the original Greek. In Greek, the phrase is "the church of God" (tan
ekklasian tou Theou) not "the church of Christ" (tan ekklasian tou Christou),
in which the Church of Christ contends that the following phrase "which he has
purchased with his blood" greatly proves that the said original Greek is
exposed to confusing interpretation, that if the "Church of God" is the correct
interpretation, the following phrase directly contradict the teaching that God
is immortal(1 Timothy 1:17) and that God is a spirit (John 4:24), has no flesh
and bones (Lk. 24:36-39). Charles Caldwell Ryrie. Charles Caldwell Ryrie has
criticized the INC for misquoting his Ryrie Study Bible regarding in the May/
June 1984 issue of the "Pasugo". Ryrie has been quoted as saying, in a letter
to Robert Elliff, the author of the book, "Iglesia Ni Cristo: The Only True
Church?" "Anyone can look in my Study Bible and see how conveniently this
author INC omitted the last phrase in the note of John 1:1. The full note
reads: ‚ÄúIn this verse the Word (Christ) is said to be with God (i.e., in
communion with and yet distinct from God) and to be God (i.e., identical in
essence with God).‚Äù If that is not clear enough to say that I believe in the
full deity and equality of Christ, let anyone read the notes at John 10:30 and
20:28. The doctrinal summary in the back of the Bible under Trinity is also
quite clear. " Evangelical apologetics response. Let Us Reason Ministries, an
online apologetics research group, criticized the INC for holding the belief
that it has the sole authority from God to interpret and preach the Bible,
while other religions do not. They also say that the INC intentionally
misinterprets and misappropriates verses to agree with their doctrines and that
they use fallacious arguments against other religions, stating: ""Unfortunately
they ignore the whole history of the Church in the zealous rebuttals against
Catholicism. Nothing is out of reach of their researchers to demean and
belittle. Some of the greatest scholars in languages and history are ignored or
misrepresented as they present what they believe is correct. I suspect that
many know better in what they teach."" They also reject the INC's doctrine that
one can only be saved if they are a member of the Iglesia ni Cristo. According
to "The Bereans Apologetics Research Ministry", some of the beliefs of INC are
contrary to mainstream Christianity. "The Bereans" also refute the INC belief
that Felix Manalo is the "angel from the east" in Revelation 7:1-3, since the
"angel from the east cried with a loud voice to the four angels"(Rev 7:2) but
according to them Manalo was never consulted by the Big Four(Wilson, Lloyd
George, Clemenceau, and Orlando) and Manalo was never involved in ending World
War I. Members Church of God International response. On April 18, 2005, MCGI
members headed by former INC member Marcos Mataro scuffled after a scheduled
religious debate with members of INC in a Jollibee outlet in Apalit, Pampanga,
Philippines. Apalit Mayor Tirso Lacanilao said "scores were injured", but that
there were no serious injuries. The MCGI radio program "Ang Dating Daan" (ADD)
and Iglesia Ni Cristo had been trading accusations in their respective
television programs. This had even led to an exchange of lawsuits. It was
reported that the clash began when an ADD follower identified only as "Mataro"
provoked INC followers. Local police, on orders of the town mayor had gone to
the restaurant and tried to stop the debate for lack of a mayor's permit. The
police had been instructed to transfer the venue of the debate either at the
ADD convention center or at the INC chapel in an effort to prevent any trouble.
Mataro insisted on pushing through with the debate, however, assuring no
trouble. Leaders of the MCGI group said they do not trust the local policemen.
Mataro shouted, which reportedly provoked some INC members to a confrontation,
and led to a free-for-all. On April 27, 2008, Mataro was shot dead by two
unknown assailants in San Simon, Pampanga. Murder charges were filed against
Nickson Icao and Felizardo Lumagham, both of Macabebe, Pampanga and allegedly
members of INC, before the San Fernando prosecutors office. Mataro's killing
could also be linked to his pending attempted homicide case before the Apalit
Municipal Trial Court and Quezon City Regional Trial Court. Secular criticism.
Ross Tipon. The main accusation of restraint of press freedom arises from the
church's seeking to stop the publication of writer Ross Tipon's book, "The
Power and the Glory: The Cult of Manalo". The INC says the book contains
"outright blasphemy" towards the late founder Felix Manalo by likening the INC
to a criminal syndicate. However, Tipon, represented by lawyer Fervyn Pinzon,
said stopping the publication of the book infringes on his freedom expression
rights. An attorney representing the INC, Abraham Espejo states "direct assault
on freedom of religion and seeks to destroy the image of the INC" and "The
publication of the criminal manuscript will trigger social unrest, Millions of
people may come out in the streets and this may lead to violence." The Iglesia
ni Cristo alleges that the book has defamed its organization and Felix Manalo.
The INC seeks PHP1,000,000 in damages from Tipon and the unknown publisher.
