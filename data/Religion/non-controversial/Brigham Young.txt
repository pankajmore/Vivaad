Brigham Young Brigham Young (; June 1, 1801 â€“ August 29, 1877) was an
American leader in the Latter Day Saint movement and a settler of the Western
United States. He was the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints (LDS Church) from 1847 until his death in 1877, he founded Salt Lake
City, and he served as the first governor of the Utah Territory, United States.
Young also led the foundings of the precursors to the University of Utah and
Brigham Young University. Young had a variety of nicknames, among the most
popular being "American Moses," (alternatively the "Modern Moses" or the
"Mormon Moses") because, like the biblical figure, Young led his followers, the
Mormon pioneers, in an exodus through a desert, to what they saw as a promised
land. Young was dubbed by his followers the "Lion of the Lord" for his bold
personality, and was also commonly called "Brother Brigham" by Latter-day
Saints. Young was a polygamist and was involved in controversies regarding
black people and the Priesthood, the Utah War, and the Mountain Meadows
massacre. Early life and succession to Joseph Smith. Young was born to John and
Abigail "Nabby" Young (nÃ©e Howe), a farming family in Whitingham, Vermont, and
worked as a travelling carpenter and blacksmith, among other trades. Young
first married in 1824 to Miriam Angeline Works. Though he had converted to the
Methodist faith in 1823, Young was drawn to Mormonism after reading the "Book
of Mormon" shortly after its publication in 1830. He officially joined the new
church in 1832 and traveled to Upper Canada as a missionary. After his first
wife died in 1832, Young joined many Mormons in establishing a community in
Kirtland, Ohio. Young was ordained a member of the original Quorum of the
Twelve Apostles in 1835, and he assumed a leadership role within that
organization in taking Mormonism to the United Kingdom and organizing the
exodus of Latter Day Saints from Missouri in 1838. While in jail awaiting trial
for alleged treason charges, Joseph Smith, president of the church, was killed
by an armed mob in 1844. Several claimants to the role of church President
emerged during the succession crisis that ensued. Before a large meeting
convened to discuss the succession in Nauvoo, Illinois, Sidney Rigdon, the
senior surviving member of the church's First Presidency, argued there could be
no successor to the deceased prophet and that he should be made the "Protector"
of the church. Young opposed this reasoning and motion. Smith had earlier
recorded a revelation which stated the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles were
"equal in authority and power" to the First Presidency, so Young claimed that
the leadership of the church fell to the Twelve Apostles. The majority in
attendance were persuaded that the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles was to lead
the church with Young as the Quorum's President. Many of Young's followers
would later reminisce that while Young spoke to the congregation, he looked or
sounded exactly like Joseph Smith, to which they attributed the power of God.
Young was ordained President of the Church in December 1847, more than two and
a half years after Smith's death. Rigdon became the president of a separate
church organization based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and other potential
successors emerged to lead what became other denominations of the movement.
Governor of Utah Territory. As colonizer and founder of Salt Lake City, Young
was appointed the territory's first governor and superintendent of American
Indian affairs by President Millard Fillmore. During his time as governor,
Young directed the establishment of settlements throughout Utah, Idaho,
Arizona, Nevada, and parts of southern Colorado and northern Mexico. Under his
direction the pioneers built roads and bridges, forts, irrigation projects, and
established public welfare, organized a militia, and pacified the Native
Americans. Young organized the first legislature and established Fillmore as
the territory's first capital. Young organized a Board of Regents to establish
a university in the Salt Lake Valley. The university was established on
February 28, 1850, as the "University of Deseret", the precursor to the
University of Utah. In 1856 he organized an efficient mail service. In 1858 he
stepped down to his successor Alfred Cumming. Church Presidency. Brigham Young
was the longest serving President of the LDS Church in history, having served
for 29 years. Migration west. After three years of leading the church as the
President of the Quorum of the Twelve, in 1847 Young reorganized a new First
Presidency and was declared president of the church on December 27, 1847.
Repeated conflict led Young to relocate his group of Latter-day Saints to a
territory in what is now Utah, then part of Mexico. Young organized the journey
that would take the faithful to Winter Quarters, Nebraska, in 1846, then to the
Salt Lake Valley. Young arrived in the Salt Lake Valley on July 24, 1847, a
date now recognized as Pioneer Day in Utah. Young organized the Mormon
Tabernacle Choir just 29 days after arriving for a conference of the church on
August 22, 1847. Educational endeavors. Having previously established the
University of Deseret (the precursor to the University of Utah) during his
tenure as governor, on October 16, 1875, Young personally purchased land in
Provo, Utah, to possibly extend the reach of the University of Deseret. Young
said, "I hope to see an Academy established in Provo... at which the children
of the Latter-day Saints can receive a good education unmixed with the
pernicious atheistic influences that are found in so many of the higher schools
of the country." The school broke off from the University of Deseret and became
"Brigham Young Academy", the precursor to Brigham Young University. Within the
church, Young reorganized the Relief Society for women (1867), and he created
organizations for young women (1869) and young men (1875). Temple building.
Young was involved in temple building throughout his membership in the LDS
Church and made temple building a priority of his presidency. Under Joseph
Smith's leadership, Young participated in the building of the Kirtland (Ohio)
and Nauvoo (Illinois) Temples. Just four days after arriving in the Salt Lake
Valley, Young, who was now church president, designated the location for the
Salt Lake Temple and presided over its groundbreaking on April 6, 1853. During
his tenure, Young oversaw construction of the Salt Lake Tabernacle, and he
announced plans to build the St. George (1871), Manti (1875), and Logan Temples
(1877) â€” all in Utah. He also provisioned the building of a "temporary
temple" called the "Endowment House", which began use in 1855 to provide temple
ordinances to church members while the Salt Lake Temple was under construction.
Controversial teachings. Though polygamy was practiced by Young's predecessor
Joseph Smith, the practice is often associated with Brigham Young. Some
denominations, such as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day
Saints, consider Young the "Father of Mormon Polygamy" In 1853, Young made the
church's first official statement on the subject after the church had arrived
in Utah. He spoke about the issue nine years after the purported original
revelation of Joseph Smith, and five years after the Mormon Exodus to Utah
following Smith's death in Illinois. Brigham Young is generally credited with
having been responsible for revoking the priesthood and temple blessings from
black members of the LDS Church, who had been treated equally in this respect
under Joseph Smith's presidency. In 1863, Young reported that he said, "Shall I
tell you the law of God in regard to the African race? If the white man who
belongs to the chosen seed mixes his blood with the seed of Cain, the penalty,
under the law of God, is death on the spot. This will always be so." ("Journal
of Discourses", vol. 10, p.Â 110) After settling in Utah in 1848, Brigham Young
announced a priesthood ban which prohibited all men of black African descent
from holding the priesthood. In connection, Mormons of African descent could
not participate in Mormon temple rites such as the Endowment or sealing. These
racial restrictions remained in place until 1978, when the policy was rescinded
by President of the Church Spencer W. Kimball. Conflicts. Shortly after the
arrival of Young's pioneers, the new Mormon colonies were incorporated into the
United States through Mexican Cession, Young petitioned the U.S. Congress to
create the State of Deseret. The Compromise of 1850 instead carved out Utah
Territory, and Young was installed as governor. As governor and church
president, Young directed both religious and economic matters. He encouraged
independence and self-sufficiency. Many cities and towns in Utah, and some in
neighboring states, were founded under Young's direction. Young's leadership
style has been viewed as autocratic. When federal officials received reports of
widespread and systematic obstruction of federal officials in Utah (most
notably judges), U.S. President James Buchanan decided to install a non-Mormon
governor. Buchanan accepted the reports of the judges without any further
investigation, and the new non-sectarian governor was accompanied by troops
sent to garrison forts in the new territory. The troops passed by the bloody
Kansasâ€“Missouri war without intervening in it, as it was not open warfare and
only isolated sporadic incidents. When Young received word that federal troops
were headed to Utah with his replacement, he called out his militia to ambush
the federal column. During the defense of Deseret, now called the Utah War,
Young held the U.S. Army at bay for a winter by taking their cattle and burning
supply wagons. The Mormon forces were largely successful thanks to Lot Smith.
Young made plans to burn Salt Lake City and move his followers to Mexico, but
at the last minute he relented and agreed to step down as governor. He later
received a pardon from Buchanan. Relations between Young and future governors
and U.S. Presidents were mixed. A controversial issue is the extent of Young's
involvement in the Mountain Meadows massacre, which took place in Washington
County in 1857. Leonard J. Arrington reports that Brigham Young received a
rider at his office on the same day. When he learned what was contemplated by
the members of the LDS Church in Parowan and Cedar City, he sent back a letter
that the Fancher party be allowed to pass through the territory unmolested.
Young's letter supposedly arrived two days too late, on September 13, 1857. As
governor, Young had promised the federal government he would protect immigrants
passing through Utah Territory, but over 120 men, women and children were
killed in this incident. There is still debate concerning the involvement of
Mormons by scholars. However, Young did order that the party be allowed to pass
"unmolested." Only children under the age of seven survived, the murdered
members of the wagon train (known as the Fancher Party) were left unburied, and
the surviving children were cared for by local Mormon families. The remains of
about forty people were found and buried and Carleton had a large cross made
from local trees, the transverse beam bearing the engraving, "Vengeance Is
Mine, Saith The Lord: I Will Repay" and erected a cairn of rocks at the site. A
large slab of granite was put up on which he had the following words engraved:
"HERE 120 MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE MASSACRED IN COLD BLOOD EARLY IN
SEPTEMBER, 1857. THEY WERE FROM ARKANSAS." For two years the monument stood as
a warning to those travelling the Spanish Trail through Mountain Meadow. Some
claim that, In 1861, Young brought an entourage to Mountain Meadows and had the
cairn and cross destroyed, while exclaiming, "Vengeance is mine and I have
taken a little". Death. Before his death in Salt Lake City at 4:00pm on August
29, 1877, Young was suffering from "cholera morbus and inflammation of the
bowels". It is believed that he died of peritonitis from a ruptured appendix.
His last words were "Joseph, Joseph...". On September 2, 1877, Young's funeral
was held in the Tabernacle with an estimated 12,000 to 15,000 people in
attendance. He is buried on the grounds of the Mormon Pioneer Memorial Monument
in the heart of Salt Lake City. A bronze marker was placed at the grave site
June 10, 1938, by members of the Young Men and Young Women organizations, which
he founded. Legacy. Impact. Memorials to Young include a bronze statue in front
of the Abraham O. Smoot Administration Building, Brigham Young University; a
marble statue in the National Statuary Hall Collection at the United States
Capitol, donated by the State of Utah in 1950; and a statue atop the "This is
the Place Monument" in Salt Lake City. Family and descendants. Young was a
polygamist, marrying a total of 55 wives, 54 of them after he converted to
become a Latter Day Saint. The policy was difficult for many in the church.
Young stated that upon being taught about plural marriage, "It was the first
time in my life that I desired the grave." By the time of his death, Young had
56 children by 16 of his wives; 46 of his children reached adulthood. Sources
have varied on the number of Young's wives, due to differences in what scholars
have considered to be a "wife". There were 55 women that Young was sealed to
during his lifetime. While the majority of the sealings were "for eternity",
some were "for time only". Researchers believe that not all of the 55 marriages
were conjugal. Young did not live with a number of his wives or publicly hold
them out as wives, which has led to confusion on the number and identities.
This is in part due to the complexity of how wives were identified in the
Mormon society at the time. Of Young's 55 wives, 21 had never been married
before; 16 were widows; six were divorced; six had living husbands; and the
marital status of six others are unknown. In 1856, Young built the Lion House
to accommodate his sizable family. This building remains a Salt Lake City
landmark, together with the Beehive House, another Brigham Young family home. A
contemporary of Young wrote: "It was amusing to walk by Brigham Young's big
house, a long rambling building with innumerable doors. Each wife has an
establishment of her own, consisting of parlor, bedroom, and a front door, the
key of which she keeps in her pocket." At the time of Young's death, 19 of his
wives had predeceased him, he was divorced from ten, and 23 survived him. The
status of four was unknown. In his will, Young shared his estate with the 16
surviving wives who had lived with him; the six surviving non-conjugal wives
were not mentioned in the will. Descendants of Young include three LDS Church
apostles: Brigham Young, Jr., John Willard Young, and Joseph Angell Young.
Another descendant, Leah D. Widtsoe, was wife of apostle John A. Widtsoe and
herself a leading expert in home economics. Other descendants include sculptor
Mahonri Young, best-selling novelist Orson Scott Card, women's right activist
Susa Young Gates, NFL Hall of Fame athlete Steve Young, and Richard Whitehead
Young, U.S. Army Brigadier General and an Associate Justice of the Supreme
Court of the Philippines. Others include Mormon critic Sandra Tanner and
William Hooper Young, 20th-century convicted murderer. Literature references
and works. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle based his first Sherlock Holmes novel, "A
Study in Scarlet", on Mormon history, mentioning Young by name. When asked to
comment on the story, which had "provoked the animosity of the Mormon
faithful", Conan Doyle noted, "all I said about the Danite Band and the murders
is historical so I cannot withdraw that though it is likely that in a work of
fiction it is stated more luridly than in a work of history." However, Doyle's
daughter stated that "You know father would be the first to admit that his
first Sherlock Holmes novel was full of errors about the Mormons." Florence
Claxton's graphic novel "The Adventures of a Woman in Search of her Rights"
(1872), satirises a would-be emancipated woman whose failure to establish an
independent career results in her marriage to Brigham Young before she wakes to
discover she's been dreaming. Mark Twain devoted a chapter and much of an
appendix to Brigham Young in his book "Roughing It". Brigham Young authored
several books and discourses during his lifetime.
