Devil The Devil (from Greek: or "diÃ¡bolos" = 'slanderer' or 'accuser') is
believed in many religions, myths and cultures to be a supernatural entity that
is the personification of evil and the enemy of God and humankind. The nature
of the role varies greatly. It ranges from being an effective opposite force to
the creator god at one extreme, where both are locked in an eons long holy war
for human souls on what may seem even terms (to the point of dualistic
ditheism/bitheism), to being just a comical figure of fun or even an abstract
aspect of the individual human condition at the other. Whilst mainstream
Judaism contains no overt concept of a devil, Christianity and Islam have
variously regarded the Devil as a rebellious fallen angel or demon that tempts
humans to sin, if not commit evil deeds himself. In these religions â€“
particularly during periods of division or external threat â€“ the Devil has
assumed more of a dualistic status commonly associated with heretics, infidels,
and other unbelievers. As such, the Devil is seen as an allegory that
represents a crisis of faith, individualism, free will, wisdom and
enlightenment. In mainstream Christianity, God and the Devil are usually
portrayed as fighting over the souls of humans, with the Devil seeking to lure
people away from God and into Hell. The Devil commands a force of evil spirits,
commonly known as demons. The Hebrew Bible (or Old Testament) describes the
Adversary (Ha-satan) as an angel who instigates tests upon humankind. Many
other religions have a trickster or tempter figure that is similar to the
Devil. Modern conceptions of the Devil include the concept that it symbolizes
humans' own lower nature or sinfulness. People often put the concept of the
Devil to use in social and political conflicts, claiming that their opponents
are influenced by the Devil or even willingly supporting the Devil. In
addition, the Devil has also been used to explain why others hold beliefs that
are considered to be false and ungodly. Etymology. Devil is a synonym for Satan
/ Ha-Satan, which descends from the Middle English , from Old English , that in
turn represents an early Germanic borrowing of Latin diabolus (also the source
of "diabolical"). This in turn was borrowed from Ancient Greek diÃ¡bolos
(Î´Î¹Î¬Î²Î¿Î»Î¿Ï‚), "slanderer", from diaballein "to slander": dia- "across,
through" + ballein "to hurl". In the New Testament, "Satan" occurs more than 30
times in passages alongside diÃ¡bolos (Ancient Greek for "the devil"),
referring to the same person or thing as Satan. Accounts in the Abrahamitic
religions. Judaism. In mainstream Judaism there is no concept of a devil like
in mainstream Christianity or Islam. Texts make no direct link between the
serpent that tempts Eve in the Garden of Eden from Genesis and references to a
Satan in the first book of Chronicles and in Job. In Hebrew, the biblical word
"ha-satan" (×”×©Ö¸×‚×˜Ö¸×Ÿ) means "the adversary" or "the obstacle", or even
"the prosecutor" (recognizing that God is viewed as the ultimate Judge). As
much as the Devil exists in any form of Judaism, his role is as an adversary
and an accuser which is assigned rather than assumed. Hebrew Apocrypha. The
Apocrypha are religious writings which are not generally accepted as scripture
by Judaism and many modern-day Protestant sects of Christianity. In the Book of
Wisdom, the devil is represented as the one who brought death into the world.
The 2nd Book of Enoch, also called the Slavonic Book of Enoch, contains
references to a Watcher Grigori called Satanael. It is a pseudepigraphic text
of an uncertain date and unknown authorship. The text describes Satanael as
being the prince of the Grigori who was cast out of heaven and an evil spirit
who knew the difference between what was "righteous" and "sinful". A similar
story is found in the book of 1 Enoch; however, in that book, the leader of the
Grigori is called SemjÃ¢zÃ¢. In the apocryphal literature, Satan rules over a
host of angels. Mastema, who induced God to test Abraham through the sacrifice
of Isaac, is identical with Satan in both name and nature. For the Chasidic
Jews of the eighteenth century, Ha-satan was "Baal Davar". The Book of Enoch
contains references to Satariel, thought also to be Sataniel and Satan'el
(etymology dating back to Babylonian origins). The similar spellings mirror
that of his angelic brethren Michael, Raphael, Uriel and Gabriel, previous to
his expulsion from Heaven. Christianity. In mainstream Christianity the Devil
is known as Satan and sometimes as Lucifer, although it has been noted that the
reference in Isaiah 14:12 to Lucifer, or the Son of the Morning, is a reference
to the Babylonian king. Some modern Christians consider the Devil to be an
angel who, along with one-third of the angelic host (the demons) rebelled
against God and has consequently been condemned to the Lake of Fire. He is
described as hating all humanity, or more accurately creation, opposing God,
spreading lies and wreaking havoc on the souls of mankind. Other Christians
consider the devil in the Bible to refer figuratively to human sin and
temptation and to any human system in opposition to God. Satan is often
identified as the serpent who convinced Eve to eat the forbidden fruit; thus,
Satan has often been depicted as a serpent. Though this identification is not
present in the Adam and Eve narrative, this interpretation goes back at least
as far as the time of the writing of the book of Revelation, which specifically
identifies Satan as being the serpent (Rev. 20:2). In the Bible, the devil is
identified with "The dragon" and "the old serpent" in the Book of Revelation
12:9, 20:2 have also been identified with Satan, as have "the prince of this
world" in the Book of John 12:31, 14:30; "the prince of the power of the air"
also called Meririm, and "the spirit that now worketh in the children of
disobedience" in the Book of Ephesians 2:2; and "the god of this world" in 2
Corinthians 4:4. He is also identified as the dragon in the Book of Revelation
(e.g.), and the tempter of the Gospels (e.g.). Beelzebub is originally the name
of a Philistine god (more specifically a certain type of Baal, from "Baâ€˜al
ZebÃ»b", lit. "Lord of Flies") but is also used in the New Testament as a
synonym for Satan. A corrupted version, "Belzeboub," appears in The Divine
Comedy. In other, non-mainstream, Christian beliefs (e.g. the beliefs of the
Christadelphians) the word "satan" in the Bible is not regarded as referring to
a supernatural, personal being but to any 'adversary' and figuratively refers
to human sin and temptation. Islam. In Islam the Devil is referred to as Iblis
or sometimes Shaitan (Arabic: in some cases "Shaitan" is a word referring to
evil devil-like beings). According to the Qur'an, God created Iblis out of
"smokeless fire" (along with all of the other jinn) and created man out of
clay. The primary characteristic of the Devil, besides hubris, is that he has
no power other than the power to cast evil suggestions into the heart of men
and women. According to Muslim theology, Iblis was expelled from the grace of
God when he disobeyed God by choosing not to pay homage to Adam, the father of
all mankind. He claimed to be superior to Adam, on the grounds that man was
created of earth unlike himself. As for the angels, they prostrated before Adam
to show their homage and obedience to God. However, Iblis, adamant in his view
that man is inferior, and unlike angels was given the ability to choose, made a
choice of not obeying God. This caused him to be expelled by God, a fact that
Iblis blamed on humanity. Initially, the Devil was successful in deceiving
Adam, but once his intentions became clear, Adam and Eve repented to God and
were freed from their misdeeds and forgiven. God gave them a strong warning
about Iblis and the fires of Hell and asked them and their children (humankind)
to stay away from the deceptions of their senses caused by the Devil. According
to the verses of the Qurâ€™an, the Devil's mission until the Qiyamah or
Resurrection Day ("yaum-ul-qiyama") is to deceive Adam's children (mankind).
After that, he will be put into the fires of Hell along with those whom he has
deceived. The Devil is also referred to as one of the jinns, as they are all
created from the smokeless fire. The Qur'an does not depict Iblis as the enemy
of God, as God is supreme over all his creations and Iblis is just one of his
creations. Iblis's single enemy is humanity. He intends to discourage humans
from obeying God. Thus, humankind is warned to struggle ("jihad") against the
mischiefs of the Satan and temptations he puts them in. The ones who succeed in
this are rewarded with Paradise ("jannath ul firdaus"), attainable only by
righteous conduct. BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith. In the BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith, a malevolent,
superhuman entity such as a "devil" or "satan" is not believed to exist. These
terms do, however, appear in the BahÃ¡'Ã­ writings, where they are used as
metaphors for the base nature of man. Human beings are seen to have free will,
and are thus able to turn towards God and develop spiritual qualities or turn
away from God and become immersed in their self-centered desires. Individuals
who follow the temptations of the self and do not develop spiritual virtues are
often described in the BahÃ¡'Ã­ writings with the word "satanic". The BahÃ¡'Ã­
writings also state that the devil is a metaphor for the "insistent self" or
"lower self" which is a self-serving inclination within each individual. Those
who follow their lower nature are also described as followers of "the Evil
One". Yazidism. An alternate name for the main deity in the tentatively Indo-
European pantheon of the Yazidi, Malek Taus, is Shaitan. Rather than Satanic,
however, Yazidism is better understood as a remnant of a pre-Islamic Middle
Eastern religion, and/or a ghulat Sufi movement founded by Shaykh Adi. The
connection with Satan, originally made by Muslim outsiders, attracted the
interest of 19th-century European travelers and esoteric writers. Other
religions. Neopaganism. Christian tradition has frequently identified pagan
religions and witchcraft with the influence of Satan. In the Early Modern
Period, the Church accused alleged witches of consorting and conspiring with
Satan. Several modern conservative Christian writers, such as Jack Chick and
James Dobson, have depicted today's neopagan and witchcraft religions as
explicitly Satanic. Few neopagan reconstructionist traditions recognize Satan
or the Devil outright. However, many neopagan groups worship some sort of
Horned God, for example as a consort of the Great Goddess in Wicca. These gods
usually reflect mythological figures such as Cernunnos or Pan, and any
similarity they may have to the Christian Devil seems to date back only to the
19th century, when a Christian reaction to Pan's growing importance in
literature and art resulted in his image being translated to that of the Devil.
New Age movement. Participants in the New Age movement have widely varied views
about Satan, the Devil, and so forth. In some forms of Esoteric Christianity
Satan remains as a being of evil, or at least a metaphor for sin and
materialism, but the most widespread tendency is to deny his existence
altogether. Lucifer, on the other hand, in the original Roman sense of "light-
bringer", occasionally appears in the literature of certain groups as a
metaphorical figure quite distinct from Satan, and without any implications of
evil. For example, Theosophy founder Madame Blavatsky named her journal
"Lucifer" since she intended it to be a "bringer of light". Many New Age
schools of thought follow a nondualistic philosophy that does not recognize a
primal force for evil. Even when a dualistic model is followed, this is more
often akin to the Chinese system of yin and yang, in which good and evil are
explicitly not a complementary duality. Schools of thought that do stress a
spiritual war between good and evil or light and darkness include the
philosophy of Rudolf Steiner, Agni Yoga, and the Church Universal and
Triumphant. Satanism. Some religions worship the Devil. This can be in a
polytheistic sense where "God", Satan, and others are all deities with Satan as
the preferred patron; or it can be from a more monotheistic viewpoint, where
God is regarded as a true god, but is nevertheless defied. Some variants deny
the existence of God and the Devil altogether, but still call themselves
Satanists, such as Anton LaVey's Church Of Satan which sees Satan as a
representation of the primal and natural state of mankind. Much "Satanic" lore
does not originate from actual Satanists, but from Christians. Best-known would
be the medieval folklore and theology surrounding demons and witches. A more
recent example is the Satanic ritual abuse scare of the 1980s â€“ beginning
with the memoir "Michelle Remembers"Â â€“ which depicts Satanism as a vast (and
unsubstantiated) conspiracy of elites with a predilection for child abuse and
human sacrifice. This genre regularly describes Satan as actually appearing in
person in order to receive worship. Similar concepts in other religions.
Zoroastrianism. In the Gathas, the oldest texts of the Zoroastrian Avesta,
believed to have been composed by Zoroaster himself, the poet does not mention
a manifest adversary. Ahura Mazda's Creation is "truth", "asha". The "lie"
("druj") is manifest only as decay or chaos, not an entity. Later, in Zurvanism
(Zurvanite Zoroastrianism), Ahura Mazda and the principle of evil, Angra
Mainyu, are the "twin" offspring of Zurvan, 'Time'. No trace of Zurvanism
exists after the 10th century. Today, the Parsis of India largely accept the
19th century interpretation that Angra Mainyu is the 'Destructive Emanation' of
Ahura Mazda. Instead of struggling against Mazda himself, Angra Mainyu battles
Spenta Mainyu, Mazda's 'Creative Emanation.' Hinduism. In contrast to
Christianity and Islam, Hinduism does not recognize any central evil force or
entity such as the Devil opposing God and man. Hinduism does recognize that
different beings (e.g., asuras) and entities can perform evil acts, under the
temporary dominance of the guna of "tamas", and cause worldly sufferings. The
Rajasic and Tamasic Gunas of Maya are considered especially close to the
Abrahamic concept, the hellish parts of the Ultimate Delusion called
"Prakriti". An embodiment of this is the concept of Advaita (non-dualism) where
there is no good or evil but simply different levels of realization. On the
other hand in Hinduism, which provides plenty of room for counterpoint, there
is also the notion of dvaita (dualism) where there is interplay between good
and evil tendencies. A prominent asura is Rahu whose characteristics are
similar to those of the Devil. However, Hindus, and Vaishnavites in particular,
believe that an avatar of Vishnu incarnates to defeat evil when evil reaches
its greatest strength. The concept of Guna and Karma also explain evil to a
degree, rather than the influence of a devil. To be more specific, Hindu
philosophy defines that the only existing thing (Truth) is the Almighty God.
So, all the asuric tendencies are inferior and mostly exist as illusions in the
mind. Asuras are also different people in whom bad motivations and intentions
(tamas) have temporarily outweighed the good ones (Sattva). Different beings
like "siddha", "gandharva", "yaksha" etc. are considered beings unlike mankind,
and in some ways superior to men. In Ayyavazhi, officially an offshoot of
Hinduism prominent in Tamil Nadu (a southern state in India with Dravidian
heritage), followers, unlike most other branches of Hinduism, believes in a
Satan-like figure, Kroni. Kroni, according to Ayyavazhi is the primordial
manifestation of evil and manifests in various forms of evil, i.e., Ravana,
Duryodhana, etc., in different ages or yugas. In response to such manifestation
of evil, believers, in Ayya-Vazhi religion believe that God, as Vishnu
manifests in His Avatars such as Rama and Krishna to defeat evil. Eventually,
the Ekam with the spirit (the spirit taken by Narayana only for incarnating in
the world) of Narayana incarnates in the world as Ayya Vaikundar to destroy the
final manifestaion of Kroni, Kaliyan. Kroni, the spirit of Kali Yuga is said to
be omnipresent in this age and that is one reason followers of Ayya Vazhi, like
most Hindus, believe that the current yuga, Kali Yuga is so degraded. Buddhism.
A devil-like figure in Buddhism is Mara. He is a tempter, who also tempted
Gautama Buddha by trying to seduce him with the vision of beautiful women who,
in various legends, are often said to be Mara's daughters. Mara personifies
unskillfulness, the "death" of the spiritual life. He tries to distract humans
from practicing the spiritual life by making the mundane alluring or the
negative seem positive. Another interpretation of Mara is that he is the
desires that are present in ones own mind preventing the person from seeing the
truth. So in a sense Mara is not an independent being but a part of one's own
being that has to be defeated. In daily life of the Buddha the role of devil
has been given to Devadatta. Ancient Egypt. In the Ausarian drama we find that
Ausar (Greek: Osiris) is chopped into 13 pieces by Set. Auset (Isis) collects
all of his pieces save his phallus. Horus, son of Ausar and Auset sets out to
avenge the death and dismemberment of his father by confronting Set. Horus is
victorious over Set and Ausar, being brought back from the dead becomes lord of
the underworld. It is this drama that gives us the cosmic conflict between good
and evil, evil being embodied by Set. This is not to say that Set was always
seen as an evil character in Ancient Egyptian theology. There are many times in
Ancient Egyptian history where conflicts between different "houses" lead to the
depreciation of one god relative to another. As in most polytheistic faiths,
the characters involved differentiate themselves from the Western tradition of
a devil in that all the gods are closely related. In this case, numerous
historic texts suggest that Set is the Uncle or Brother of Horus and in the
"defeat" of Set, we see another separation from the norm in the devouring/
assimilation of Set into Horus with the result of Horus having depictions of
both the falcon head and the (unknown animal) head of Set. This (like Buddhism)
represents a dissolution of dichotomy. World folklore. In the Western Christian
tradition, the Devil has entered popular folklore, particularly in his role as
a trickster figure. As such, he is found as a character in a wide number of
traditional folktales and legends from Ireland, Newfoundland, Italy and the
United Kingdom, where he often attempts to trick or outwit other characters. In
some of these tales, the Devil is portrayed as more of a folk villain than as
the personification of evil. The Devil also features prominently in a number of
hagiographical tales, or tales of the saints such as the popular tale of St.
Dunstan, many of which may fall outside the authorized religious canon. The
Devil is also a recurring feature in tales explaining the etymology of
geographical names, lending his name to natural formations such as The Devil's
Chimney. David Ferriero, Archivist of the United States, claims to have only
one piece of correspondence with the Devil in the nation's vast and varied
collections. A letter sent from Baltimore at the end of the American Civil War
to Confederate leader Jefferson Davis bemoans the rebellion against the United
States and is signed by "the Devil". Other names. Demons. In some religions and
traditions, these titles are separate demons; others identify these names as
guises of The Devil. Even when thought of as individual demons, some are often
thought of being under the Devil's direct control. This identifies only those
thought of as the Devil; List of demons has a more general listing. Titles.
These are titles that almost always refer to the Devil. A list of liturgical
names for the Devil may be found in Jeffrey Burton Russell, "Lucifer, the Devil
in the Middle Ages" (Cornell University Press, 1986), p.Â 128, note 76 online.
God as the Devil. Several religious authors throughout history have advanced
the notion that the god of the Abrahamic "Bible" and its sequels is consistent
in character with the Devil. They make the case that the Biblical God is a
divine force that wreaks suffering, death, and destruction and that tempts or
commands humanity into committing mayhem and genocide. These writings refer to
the Biblical God variously as "a demiurgus", "an evil angel", "the devil god",
"the Prince of Darkness", "the source of all evil", "a demon", "a cruel,
wrathful, warlike tyrant", "Satan", "the devil", and "the first beast of the
book of Revelation". Many of the authors criticize only Jehovah, the God of the
Abrahamic scriptures ("Tanakh"), in contrast with the "true god" of the New
Testament. However, other authors apply their condemnation to the entire
godhead of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The authors assert their claims by
reference to a number of passages in Biblical scripture describing actions of
God that they say are evil or Devil-like. Many of the authors have been
severely chastised for their writings, and their followers killed.
