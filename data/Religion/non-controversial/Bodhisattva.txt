Bodhisattva In Buddhism, a bodhisattva ( "bodhisattva"; "bodhisatta") is either
an enlightened ("bodhi") existence ("sattva") or an enlightenment-being or,
given the variant Sanskrit spelling "satva" rather than "sattva," "heroic-
minded one ("satva") for enlightenment ("bodhi")." The Pali term has sometimes
been translated as "wisdom-being," although in modern publications, and
especially in tantric works, this is more commonly reserved for the term
"jÃ±Änasattva" ("awareness-being"; Tib.

Traditionally, a bodhisattva is anyone who, motivated by great compassion, has
generated "bodhicitta", which is a spontaneous wish to attain Buddhahood for
the benefit of all sentient beings. The bodhisattva is a popular subject in
Buddhist art. Usage of the term bodhisattva has evolved over time. In early
Indian Buddhism, for example, the term bodhisattva was primarily used to refer
specifically to the Buddha Shakyamuni in his former lives. The Jatakas, which
are the stories of his lives, depict the various attempts of the bodhisattva to
embrace qualities like self-sacrifice and morality. In TheravÄda Buddhism. The
term ""bodhisatta"" (PÄli language) was used by the Buddha in the PÄli canon
to refer to himself both in his previous lives and as a young man in his
current life, prior to his enlightenment, in the period during which he was
working towards his own liberation. When, during his discourses, he recounts
his experiences as a young aspirant, he regularly uses the phrase "When I was
an unenlightened bodhisatta..." The term therefore connotes a being who is
"bound for enlightenment", in other words, a person whose aim is to become
fully enlightened. In the PÄli canon, the bodhisatta is also described as
someone who is still subject to birth, illness, death, sorrow, defilement, and
delusion. Some of the previous lives of the Buddha as a bodhisattva are
featured in the "JÄtaka" tales. While Maitreya (PÄli: Metteya) is mentioned
in the PÄli canon, he is not referred to as a bodhisattva, but simply the next
fully awakened Buddha to come into existence long after the current teachings
of the Buddha are lost. In later TheravÄda literature, the term "bodhisatta"
is used fairly frequently in the sense of someone on the path to liberation.
The later tradition of commentary also recognizes the existence of two
additional types of bodhisattas: the "paccekabodhisatta" who will attain
Paccekabuddhahood, and the "savakabodhisatta" who will attain enlightenment as
a disciple of a Buddha. According to the TheravÄda teacher Bhikkhu Bodhi the
bodhisattva path was not taught by Buddha [http://www.buddhanet.net/budsas/
ebud/ebdha335.htm]. Theravadin bhikku and scholar Walpola Rahula (Sri Rahula
Maha Thera) has stated that the bodhisattva ideal has traditionally been held
to be higher than the state of a "Å›rÄvaka" not only in MahÄyÄna, but also
in TheravÄda Buddhism. He also quotes an inscription from the 10th Century
king of Sri Lanka, Mahinda IV (956-972 CE) who had the words inscribed "none
but the bodhisattvas would become kings of Sri Lanka", among other examples.
Paul Williams writes that some modern Theravada meditation masters in Thailand
are popularly regarded as bodhisattvas. In MahÄyÄna Buddhism. Bodhisattva
ideal. MahÄyÄna Buddhism is based principally upon the path of a bodhisattva.
According to Jan Nattier, the term "MahÄyÄna" ("Great Vehicle") was
originally even an honorary synonym for "BodhisattvayÄna", or the "Bodhisattva
Vehicle." The "" contains a simple and brief definition for the term
"bodhisattva", which is also the earliest known MahÄyÄna definition. This
definition is given as the following. MahÄyÄna Buddhism encourages everyone
to become bodhisattvas and to take the bodhisattva vows. With these vows, one
makes the promise to work for the complete enlightenment of all sentient beings
by practicing the six perfections. Indelibly entwined with the bodhisattva vow
is merit transference ("pariá¹‡ÄmanÄ"). In MahÄyÄna Buddhism life in this
world is compared to people living in a house that is on fire. People take this
world as reality pursuing worldly projects and pleasures without realizing that
the house is on fire and will soon burn down (due to the inevitability of
death). A bodhisattva is one who has a determination to free sentient beings
from samsara and its cycle of death, rebirth and suffering. This type of mind
is known as the mind of awakening ("bodhicitta"). Bodhisattvas take bodhisattva
vows in order to progress on the spiritual path towards buddhahood. There are a
variety of different conceptions of the nature of a bodhisattva in MahÄyÄna.
According to some MahÄyÄna sources a bodhisattva is someone on the path to
full Buddhahood. Others speak of bodhisattvas renouncing Buddhahood. According
to the "Kun-bzang bla-ma'i zhal-lung", a bodhisattva can choose any of three
paths to help sentient beings in the process of achieving buddhahood. They are:
In reality, the second two types of bodhicitta are wishes that are impossible
to fulfill because it is only possible to lead others to enlightenment once we
have attained enlightenment ourself. Therefore, only king-like bodhicitta is
actual bodhicitta. Je Tsongkhapa says that although the other Bodhisattvas wish
for that which is impossible, their attitude is sublime and unmistaken. The
Nyingma school, however, holds that the lowest level is the way of the king,
who primarily seeks his own benefit but who recognizes that his benefit depends
crucially on that of his kingdom and his subjects. The middle level is the path
of the boatman, who ferries his passengers across the river and simultaneously,
of course, ferries himself as well. The highest level is that of the shepherd,
who makes sure that all his sheep arrive safely ahead of him and places their
welfare above his own. Ten grounds. According to many traditions within
MahÄyÄna Buddhism, on the way to becoming a Buddha, a bodhisattva proceeds
through ten, or sometimes fourteen, grounds or "bhÅ«mis." Below is the list of
the ten "bhÅ«mis" and their descriptions according to the "Avataá¹ƒsaka SÅ«tra"
and "The Jewel Ornament of Liberation," a treatise by Gampopa, an influential
teacher of the Tibetan Kagyu school. (Other schools give slightly variant
descriptions.) Before a bodhisattva arrives at the first ground, he or she
first must travel the first two of the five paths: The ten grounds of the
bodhisattva then can be grouped into the next three paths After the ten
"bhÅ«mis", according to MahÄyÄna Buddhism, one attains complete enlightenment
and becomes a Buddha. With the 52 stages, the "ÅšÅ«raá¹…gama SÅ«tra" recognizes
57 stages. With the 10 grounds, various VajrayÄna schools recognize 3â€“10
additional grounds, mostly 6 more grounds with variant descriptions. A
bodhisattva above the 7th ground is called a "mahÄsattva". Some bodhisattvas
such as Samantabhadra are also said to have already attained buddhahood. School
doctrines. Some sutras said a beginner would take 3â€“22 countless eons
("mahÄsaá¹ƒkhyeya kalpas") to become a buddha. Pure Land Buddhism suggests
buddhists go to the pure lands to practice. Tiantai, Huayan, Zen and VajrayÄna
schools say they teach ways to attain buddhahood within one karmic cycle.
Various traditions within Buddhism believe in specific bodhisattvas. Some
bodhisattvas appear across traditions, but due to language barriers may be seen
as separate entities. For example, Tibetan Buddhists believe in various forms
of Chenrezig, who is AvalokiteÅ›vara in Sanskrit, Guanyin (Kwan-yin or Kuan-
yin) in China and Korea, Quan Am in Vietnam, and Kannon (formerly spelled and
pronounced: Kwannon) in Japan. Followers of Tibetan Buddhism consider the Dalai
Lamas and the Karmapas to be an emanation of Chenrezig, the Bodhisattva of
Compassion. If I do not go to the hell to help the suffering beings there, who
else will go? ... if the hells are not empty I will not become a Buddha. Only
when all living beings have been saved, will I attain Bodhi. The place of a
bodhisattva's earthly deeds, such as the achievement of enlightenment or the
acts of dharma, is known as a "bodhimanda", and may be a site of pilgrimage.
Many temples and monasteries are famous as "bodhimandas"; for instance, the
island of Putuoshan, located off the coast of Ningbo, is venerated by Chinese
Buddhists as the "bodhimanda" of AvalokiteÅ›vara. Perhaps the most famous
"bodhimanda" of all is the bodhi tree under which ÅšÄkyamuá¹‡i achieved
buddhahood.
