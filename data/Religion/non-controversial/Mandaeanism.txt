Mandaeism Mandaeism or Mandaeanism ( (); "/"; "") is a gnostic religion
(Aramaic "manda" means "knowledge", as does Greek "gnosis") with a strongly
dualistic worldview. Its adherents, the Mandaeans, revere Adam, Abel, Seth,
Enosh, Noah, Shem, Aram and especially John the Baptist, but reject Jesus of
Nazareth and Christianity. They are sometimes identified with mentions in the
Quran of the Sabian religion, particularly in an Arabian context, but the
Sabian religious community is extinct today. According to most scholars,
Mandaeans migrated from the Southern Levant to Mesopotamia in the first
centuries CE and are certainly of pre-Arab and pre-Islamic origin. They are
Semites and speak a dialect of Eastern Aramaic known as Mandaic. They may well
be related to the "Nabateans of Iraq" who were pagan, Aramaic speaking
indigenous pre-Arab and pre-Islamic inhabitants of southern Iraq. Mandaeans
appear to have settled in northern Mesopotamia, but the religion has been
practised primarily around the lower Karun, Euphrates and Tigris and the rivers
that surround the Shatt-al-Arab waterway, part of southern Iraq and Khuzestan
Province in Iran. There are thought to be between 60,000 and 70,000 Mandaeans
worldwide, and until the 2003 Iraq war, almost all of them lived in Iraq. Many
Mandaean Iraqis have since fled their country (as have many other Iraqis)
because of the turmoil created by the War on Terror and subsequent rise in
sectarian violence by Muslim extremists. By 2007, the population of Mandaeans
in Iraq had fallen to approximately 5,000. Most Mandaean Iraqis have sought
refuge in Iran with the fellow Mandaeans there. Others have moved to northern
Iraq. There has been a much smaller influx into Syria and Jordan, with smaller
populations in Sweden, Australia, the United States, and other Western
countries. The Mandaeans have remained separate and intensely private‚Äîreports
of them and of their religion have come primarily from outsiders, particularly
from the Orientalist Julius Heinrich Petermann, Nicolas Siouffi a Yazidi
(1880), and Lady Drower. An Anglican vicar, Rev. Peter Owen-Jones, included a
short segment on a Mandaean group in Sydney, Australia, in his BBC series
"Around the World in 80 Faiths". Origin of name. The term Mandaeism comes from
Classical Mandaic "Mandaiia" and appears in Neo-Mandaic as "MandeyƒÅnƒÅ". On
the basis of cognates in other Aramaic dialects, Semiticists such as Mark
Lidzbarski and Rudolf Macuch have translated the term "manda", from which
"Mandaiia" derives, as "knowledge" (cf. Aramaic ◊û÷∑◊ ÷∞◊ì÷∑÷º◊¢ ' in Dan. 2:
21, 4:31, 33, 5:12; cpr. ' without the nasal insert). This etymology suggests
that the Mandaeans may well be the only sect surviving from late Antiquity to
identify themselves explicitly as Gnostics. Other scholars derive the term
"mandaiia" from "MandƒÅ d-Heyyi" (Mandaic " "Knowledge of Life", reference to
the chief divinity "hiia rbia" "the Great Life") or from the word "(bi)manda",
which is the cultic hut in which many Mandaean ceremonies are performed (such
as the baptism, which is the central sacrament of Mandaean religious life).
This last term is possibly to be derived from Pahlavi "m‚Äônd" "mƒÅnd"
("house"). Within the Middle East, but outside of their community, the
Mandaeans are more commonly known as the ' (singular: ). The term ' is derived
from the Aramaic root related to baptism, the neo-Mandaic is '. In Islam, the
term "Sabians" ( ') is used as a blanket term for adherents to a number of
religions, including that of the Mandaeans, in reference to the Sabians of the
Qur'an (see below). Occasionally, Mandaeans are called Christians of Saint
John, based upon preliminary reports made by members of the Discalced Carmelite
mission in Basra during the 16th century. A ' () is a place of worship for
followers of Mandaeism. A ' must be built beside a river in order to perform
"ma·π£battah" (baptism) because water is an essential element in the Mandaeic
faith. Modern ""s sometimes have a bath inside a building instead. History. The
evidence about Mandaean history has been almost entirely confined to some of
the Mandaen religious literature. Suggestions that Mandaeism had a pre-
Christian origin are rejected by most scholars. Arab sources of early Qur'anic
times (7th century) make some references to Sabians. They are counted among the
"Ahl al-KitƒÅb" (People of the Book), and several hadith feature them. Some
scholars hold that these Sabians are those currently referred to as Mandaeans,
while others contend that the etymology of the root word 'Sabi'un' points to
origins either in the Syriac or Mandaic word 'Sabian', and suggest that the
Mandaean religion originated with Sabeans who came under the influence of early
Hellenic Sabian missionaries, but preferred their own priesthood. The Sabians
believed to "belong to the prophet Noah"; similarly, the Mandaeans claim direct
ancestry from Noah. Early in the 9th century, a group in the northern
Mesopotamian city of Harran declared themselves Sabians when facing
persecution; an Assyrian Christian writer said that the true 'Sabians' or Sabba
lived in the marshes of lower Iraq. The earliest account we have about the
Mandaeans is that of the Assyrian writer Theodore Bar Konai (in the Scholion,
A.D. 792). In the "Fihrist" ("Book of Nations") of Arabic scholar Al-Nadim (an
c.987), the "Mogtasilah" ("Mughtasila"..., "self-ablutionists") are counted
among the followers of "El-Hasaih". Called a "sect" of "Sabians", they are
located in southern Mesopotamia. No verbatim reference to Mandaeans, which were
a distinct group by then, seems to have been made by Al-Nadim; "Mogtasilah" was
not that group's endonym, and the few details on rituals and habit are similar
to Mandaeans ones. "Mogtasilah" may thus have been Al-Nadim's term for the
Mandaeans, but they may just as well have been a related group which does not
exist anymore today. In any case, Elchasai's religious community seems to have
prospered but ultimately splintered; early on, the prophet Mani renounced
Judaism and departed with his followers. Likewise, the Mandaeans may have
originated in a schism where they renounced the Torah, while the mainstream
Sampsaeans held on to it (as Elchasai's followers did); this must have happened
around the mid-late 1st millennium AD. Al-Biruni (writing at the beginning of
the 11th century AD) said that the 'real Sabians' were "the remnants of the
Jewish tribes who remained in Babylonia when the other tribes left it for
Jerusalem in the days of Cyrus and Artaxerxes. These remaining tribes...adopted
a system mixed up of Magism and Judaism." It is not clear what group he
referred to exactly, for by then the Elchasaite sects may have been at their
most diverse. Some disappeared subsequently, the Sampsaeans for example are not
well attested in later sources. The "Ginza Rba", one of the chief holy
scriptures of the Mandaeans, appears to originate around the time of Elchasai
or somewhat thereafter (see below); unfortunately, none of the Manichaean
scriptures has survived in its entirety, and as it seems the remaining
fragments have not been compared to the "Ginza Rba". ‚ÄúA very strange and
singular people, in terms of their rituals, lives in the desert near Baghdad;
they are called Sabaeans. Many of them came to me and begged me insistently to
go and visit them. They are a very simple people and they claim to possess a
secret law of God, which they preserve in beautiful books. Their writing is a
sort of middle way between Syriac and Arabic. They detest Abraham because of
circumcision and they venerate John the Baptist above all. They live only near
a few rivers in the desert. They wash day and night so as not to be condemned
by God, ‚Ä¶‚Äù Some Portuguese Jesuits had met some "Saint John Christians" or
Mandaeans around the Strait of Hormuz in 1559, when the Portuguese fleet fought
with the Ottoman Turkish army in Bahrain. These Mandaean seemed to be willing
to obey the Catholic Church. They learned and used the seven Catholic
sacraments and the related ceremonies in their lives. Beliefs. Mandaeism, as
the religion of the Mandaean people, is based more on a common heritage than on
any set of religious creeds and doctrines. A basic guide to Mandaean theology
does not exist. The corpus of Mandaean literature, though quite large, covers
topics such as eschatology, the knowledge of God, and the afterlife only in an
unsystematic manner, and, apart from the priesthood, is known only to a few
laypeople. Fundamental tenets. Mandaeans believe in marriage and procreation,
and in the importance of leading an ethical and moral lifestyle in this world,
placing a high priority upon family life. Consequently, Mandaeans do not
practice celibacy or asceticism. Mandaeans will, however, abstain from strong
drink and red meat. While they agree with other gnostic sects that the world is
a prison governed by the planetary archons, they do not view it as a cruel and
inhospitable one. Scriptures. The Mandaeans have a large corpus of religious
scriptures, the most important of which is the "GenzƒÅ RabbƒÅ" or Ginza, a
collection of history, theology, and prayers (German translation available
here). The "GenzƒÅ RabbƒÅ" is divided into two halves‚Äîthe "GenzƒÅ SmƒÅlƒÅ" or
"Left Ginza" and the "GenzƒÅ YeminƒÅ" or "Right Ginza". By consulting the
colophons in the Left Ginza, Jorunn J. Buckley has identified an uninterrupted
chain of copyists to the late 2nd or early 3rd c. AD. The colophons attest to
the existence of the Mandaeans or their predecessors during the late Arsacid
period at the very latest, a fact corroborated by the "HarrƒÅn GƒÅwetƒÅ"
legend, according to which the Mandaeans left Judea after the destruction of
Jerusalem in the 1st c. CE, and settled within the Arsacid empire. Although the
Ginza continued to evolve under the rule of the Sassanians and the Islamic
empires, few textual traditions can lay claim to such extensive continuity.
Other important books include the "QolastƒÅ", the "Canonical Prayerbook of the
Mandaeans", which was translated by E. S. Drower (much of it is found here).
and here One of the chief works of Mandaean scripture, accessible to laymen and
initiates alike, is the "Dra≈°a D-Iahia" "The Book of John the Baptist" (text;
German translation), which includes a dialogue between John and Jesus. In
addition to the "Ginza", "Qolusta", and "Dra≈°a", there is the "Dƒ´vƒÅn", which
contains a description of the 'regions' the soul ascends through, and the Asfar
MalwƒÅshƒì, the "Book of the Zodiacal Constellations". Finally, there are some
pre-Muslim artifacts which contain Mandaean writings and inscriptions, such as
some Aramaic incantation bowls. The language in which the Mandaean religious
literature was originally composed is known as Mandaic, and is a member of the
Aramaic family of dialects. It is written in a cursive variant of the Parthian
chancellory script. Many Mandaean lay people do not speak this language, though
some members of the Mandaean community resident in Iran and Iraq continue to
speak Neo-Mandaic, a modern version of this language. Cosmology. As noted above
(under Mandaean Beliefs) Mandaean theology is not systematic. There is no one
single authoritative account of the creation of the cosmos, but rather a series
of several accounts. Some scholars, such as Edmondo Lupieri, maintain that
comparison of these different accounts may reveal the diverse religious
influences upon which the Mandaeans have drawn and the ways in which the
Mandaean religion has evolved over time. In contrast with the religious texts
of the western Gnostic sects formerly found in Syria and Egypt, the earliest
Mandaean religious texts suggest a more strictly dualistic theology, typical of
other Iranian religions such as Zoroastrianism, Zurvanism, Manichaeism, and the
teachings of Mazdak. In these texts, instead of a large pleroma, there is a
discrete division between "light" and "darkness". The ruler of darkness is
called Ptahil (similar to the Gnostic Demiurge), and the originator of the
light (i.e. God) is only known as "the great first Life from the worlds of
light, the sublime one that stands above all works". When this being emanated,
other spiritual beings became increasingly corrupted, and they and their ruler
Ptahil created our world. The name Ptahil is suggestive of the Egyptian
Ptah‚Äîthe Mandaeans believe that they were resident in Egypt for a
while‚Äîjoined to the semitic El, meaning "god". The issue is further
complicated by the fact that Ptahil alone does not constitute the demiurge but
only fills that role insofar as he is the creator of our world. Rather, Ptahil
is the lowest of a group of three "demiurgic" beings, the other two being
Yushamin (a.k.a. Joshamin) and Abathur. Abathur's demiurgic role consists of
his sitting in judgment upon the souls of mortals. The role of Yushamin, the
senior being, is more obscure; wanting to create a world of his own, he was
severely punished for opposing the King of Light. Lupieri observes that he is
generally considered a positive figure nevertheless. The name may derive from
Iao "ha≈°-≈°ammayim" (in Hebrew: Yahweh "of the heavens"). Chief prophets.
Mandaeans recognize several prophets. Yahya ibn Zakariyya, known by Christians
as John the Baptist, is accorded a special status, higher than his role in
Christianity and Islam. Mandaeans do not consider John to be the founder of
their religion but revere him as one of their greatest teachers, tracing their
beliefs back to Adam. Mandaeans maintain that Jesus was a "m≈°iha kdaba" "false
messiah" who perverted the teachings entrusted to him by John. The Mandaic word
"k(a)daba", however, might be interpreted as being derived from either of two
roots: the first root, meaning "to lie," is the one traditionally ascribed to
Jesus; the second, meaning "to write," might provide a second meaning, that of
"book"; hence some Mandaeans, motivated perhaps by an ecumenical spirit,
maintain that Jesus was not a "lying Messiah" but a "book Messiah", the "book"
in question presumably being the Christian Gospels. This seems to be a folk
etymology without support in the Mandaean texts. Likewise, the Mandaeans
believe that Abraham and Moses were false prophets, but recognize other
prophetic figures from the Abrahamic traditions, such as Adam, his sons Hibil
(Abel) and ≈ itil (Seth), and his grandson Anu≈° (Enosh), as well as Nuh
(Noah), his son Sam (Shem) and his son Ram (Aram). The latter three they
consider to be their direct ancestors. Mandaeans consider the holy spirit that
is known as Ruha d-Qudsha in the Talmud and Bible to be an evil being. Priests
and laymen. There are three grades of priesthood in Mandaeism: the "tarmidia"
"disciples" (Neo-Mandaic "tarmidƒÅnƒÅ"), the "ganzibria" "treasurers" (from Old
Persian "ganza-bara" "id.", Neo-Mandaic ') and the "ri≈°amma" "leader of the
people." This last office, the highest level of the Mandaean priesthood, has
lain vacant for many years. At the moment, the highest office currently
occupied is that of the ', a title which appears first in a religious context
in the Aramaic ritual texts from Persepolis (ca. 3rd c. BCE) and which may be
related to the "kamnaskires" (Elamite
°-ki-ra> "kapnuskir" "treasurer"), title of the rulers of Elymais (modern
Khuzestan) during the Hellenistic age. Traditionally, any ' who baptizes seven
or more ' may qualify for the office of "ri≈°amma", though the Mandaean
community has yet to rally as a whole behind any single candidate. The
contemporary priesthood can trace its immediate origins to the first half of
the 19th century. In 1831, an outbreak of cholera devastated the region and
eliminated most if not all of the Mandaean religious authorities. Two of the
surviving acolytes ("≈°gandia"), Yahia Bihram and Ram Zihrun, reestablished the
priesthood on the basis of their own training and the texts that were available
to them. In 2009 there were two dozen Mandaean priests in the world, according
to the Associated Press. Possibly related groups. Elcesaites. According to the
"Fihrist" of ibn al-Nadim, the Mesopotamian prophet Mani, the founder of
Manichaeism, was brought up within the Elkasaites ("Elcesaites" or
"Elchasaite") sect, this being confirmed more recently by the Cologne Mani
Codex. The Elkasaites were a Judeo-Christian baptismal sect which seem to have
been related, possibly ancestral, to the Mandaeans (see Sabians). The members
of this sect, like the Mandaeans, wore white and performed baptisms. They dwelt
in east Judea and Assyria, whence the Mandaeans claim to have migrated to
southern Mesopotamia, according to the "Harran GawaitƒÅ" legend. Mani later
left the Elkasaites to found his own religion. In a comparative analysis,
Mandaean scholar S√§ve-S√∂derberg indicated that Mani's "Psalms of Thomas" were
closely related to Mandaean texts. This would imply that Mani had access to
Mandaean religious literature, or both derived from the same source. 4th-
century Nazarenes. The Haran Gawaita uses the name Nasoreans for the Mandaeans
arriving from Jerusalem. Consequently the Mandaeans have been connected with
the 4th-century Nazarenes (sect) described by Epiphanius, although Epiphanius
himself explains that Nasoreans were not to be confused with the Nazarites.
Dositheans. They are connected with the Dositheans by Theodore Bar K≈çnƒ´ in
his "Scholion". Mughtasila, baptizers. Ibn al-Nadim also mentions a group
called the "Mughtasila", "the self-ablutionists", who may be identified with
one or the other of these groups. The members of this sect, like the Mandaeans,
wore white and performed baptisms. Identifications. Whether groups such as the
Elkasaites, the "Mughtasila", the Nasoraeans, and the Dositheans can be
identified with the Mandaeans or one another is a difficult question. While it
seems certain that a number of distinct groups are intended by these names, the
nature of these sects and the connections between them are less than clear. At
least according to the "Fihrist" (see above), these groups seem all to have
emerged from or developed in parallel with the "Sabian" followers of "El-
Hasaih"; "Elkasaites" in particular may simply have been a blanket term for
Mughtasila, Mandaeans, the original Sabians and even Manichaeans. Mandaeans
today. Mandaeans are an ethnoreligious group indigenous to the alluvial plain
of southern Mesopotamia and are exclusively followers of Mandaeism, a Gnostic
religion, originated in the Middle East. The Mandaeans were originally native
speakers of Mandaic, a Semitic language, which evolved from Eastern Middle
Aramaic, before switching to colloquial Iraqi Arabic and Modern Persian.
Mandaic is mainly preserved as a liturgical language. During the last decade
the indigenous Mandaic community of Iraq, which used to number 60-70,000
persons has collapsed due to Iraq War, with most of the community relocating to
nearby Iran, Syria and Jordan and forming diaspora communities outside of the
Middle East. The other indigenous community of Iranian Mandaeans has also been
dwindling due to religious persecution over the last decade.
