Bah√°'u'll√°h Bah√°'u'll√°h (; , "Glory of God"; 12 November 1817¬ ‚Äì 29 May
1892), born (), was the founder of the Bah√°'√≠ Faith. He claimed to be the
prophetic fulfilment of B√°bism, a 19th-century outgrowth of Sh√≠‚Äòism, but in
a broader sense claimed to be a messenger from God referring to the fulfilment
of the eschatological expectations of Islam, Christianity, and other major
religions. Bah√°'u'll√°h taught that humanity is one single race and that the
age has come for its unification in a global society. His claim to divine
revelation resulted in persecution and imprisonment by the Persian and Ottoman
authorities, and his eventual 24-year confinement in the prison city of `Akka,
Palestine (present day Israel), where he died. He wrote many religious works,
most notably the "Kit√°b-i-Aqdas" and the "Kit√°b-i-√çq√°n". There are two
known photographs of Bah√°'u'll√°h. Outside of pilgrimage, Bah√°'√≠s prefer not
to view his photo in public, or even to display it in their private homes.
Early and family life. Bah√°'u'll√°h was born on 12 November 1817, in Tehran,
the capital of Persia, present-day Iran. Bah√°'√≠ authors state that his
ancestry can be traced back to Abraham through Abraham's wife Keturah, to
Zoroaster and to Yazdigird III, the last king of the Sassanid Empire, and also
to Jesse. His mother was Khad√≠jih Kh√°num and his father was M√≠rz√° Buzurg.
Bah√°'u'll√°h's father, M√≠rz√° Buzurg, served as vizier to Im√°m-Virdi
M√≠rz√°, the twelfth son of Fat‚Ä≤h Ali Shah Qajar. M√≠rz√° Buzurg was later
appointed governor of Burujird and Lorestan, a position that he was stripped of
during a government purge when Muhammad Shah came to power. After the death of
his father, Bah√°'u'll√°h was asked to take a government post by the new vizier
Haji Mirza Aqasi, but declined. Bah√°'u'll√°h was married three times. He
married his first wife √Ås√≠yih Kh√°num, the daughter of a nobleman, in Tehran
in 1835, when he was 18 and she was 15. She was given the title of "The Most
Exalted Leaf" and "Navv√°b". His second marriage was to his widowed cousin
F√°timih Kh√°num, in Tehran in 1849 when she was 21 and he was 32. She was
known as "Mahd-i-`Uly√°". His third marriage to Gawhar Kh√°num occurred in
Baghdad sometime before 1863. Bah√°'u'll√°h declared √Ås√≠yih Kh√°num his
"perpetual consort in all the worlds of God", and her son `Abdu'l-Bah√° as his
vicar. He had 14 children, four daughters and ten sons, five of whom he
outlived. Bah√°'√≠s regard √Ås√≠yih Kh√°num and her children M√≠rz√° Mihd√≠,
Bah√≠yyih Kh√°num and `Abdu'l-Bah√°' to be the Bah√°'√≠ holy family. B√°b√≠
movement. In 1844, a 25 year-old man from Shiraz, claimed to be the promised
redeemer (or Mahdi) of Islam, taking the title of the B√°b, or the "Gate". The
resulting B√°b√≠ movement quickly spread across the Persian Empire and received
widespread opposition from the Islamic clergy. The B√°b himself was executed in
1850 by a firing squad in the public square of Tabriz at the age of 30 and the
community was almost entirely exterminated in 1852‚Äì3. While the B√°b claimed
a station of revelation, he also claimed no finality for his revelation. In
most of his prominent writings, the B√°b alluded to a Promised One, most
commonly referred to as "Him whom God shall make manifest". According to the
B√°b, this personage, promised in the sacred writings of previous religions,
would establish the kingdom of God on the Earth; several of the B√°b's writings
state the coming of "Him Whom God shall make manifest" would be imminent. In
the books written by the B√°b he constantly entreats his believers to follow
"Him whom God shall make manifest" when he arrives. The B√°b also eliminated
the institution of successorship or vicegerency to his movement, and stated
that no other person's writings would be binding after his death until "Him
whom God shall make manifest" would appear. Acceptance of the B√°b.
Bah√°'u'll√°h first heard of the B√°b when he was 27, and received a visitor
sent by the B√°b, Mull√° Husayn, telling him of the B√°b and his claims.
Bah√°'u'll√°h accepted the B√°b's claims, becoming a B√°b√≠ and helping to
spread the new movement, especially in his native province of N√∫r, where he
became recognized as one of its most influential believers. His notability as a
local gave him many openings, and his trips to teach the religion were met with
success, even among some of the religious class. He also helped to protect
fellow believers, such as T√°hirih, for which he was temporarily imprisoned in
Tehran and punished with bastinado or foot whipping. Bah√°'u'll√°h, in the
summer of 1848, also attended the conference of Badasht in the province of
Khorasan, where 81 prominent B√°b√≠s met for 22 days; at that conference where
there was a discussion between those B√°b√≠s who wanted to maintain Islamic law
and those who believed that the B√°b's message began a new dispensation,
Bah√°'u'll√°h took the pro-change side, which eventually won out. It is at this
conference that Bah√°'u'll√°h took on the name Bah√°. When violence started
between the B√°b√≠s and the Qajar government in the later part of 1848,
Bah√°'u'll√°h tried to reach the besieged B√°b√≠s at the Shaykh Tabarsi in
Mazandaran, but was arrested and imprisoned before he could get there. The
following years until 1850 saw the B√°b√≠s being massacred in various provinces
after the B√°b made his claim of being Manifestation of God more public.
S√≠y√°h-Ch√°l. After the B√°b was executed in 1850, a group of Tehran B√°b√≠s,
headed by a B√°b√≠ known as Azim, who was previously a Shaykhi cleric, plotted
an assassination plan against the Shah Nasser-al-Din Shah, in retaliation for
the B√°b's execution. The policy was opposed by Bah√°'u'll√°h, and he condemned
the plan, however, any moderating influence that he may have had was diminished
since in June 1851 he went into exile to Baghdad at the chief minister's
request, returning only after Amir Kabir's fall from power. On 15 August 1852,
the radical group of B√°b√≠s attempted to carry out the assassination of the
Shah and failed. The group of B√°b√≠s linked with the plan, were rounded up and
killed, and, notwithstanding the assassins' claim that they were working alone,
the entire B√°b√≠ community was blamed, precipitating violent riots against the
B√°b√≠ community by the government. During this time many B√°b√≠s were killed,
and many of the B√°b√≠s who were not killed, including Bah√°'u'll√°h, were
imprisoned in the S√≠y√°h-Ch√°l (black pit), an underground dungeon of Tehran.
According to Bah√°'u'll√°h, it was during his imprisonment in the S√≠y√°h-Ch√°l
that he had several mystical experiences, and that he received a vision of a
maiden from God, through whom he received his mission as a messenger of God and
as the one whose coming the B√°b had prophesied. After four months in the
S√≠y√°h-Ch√°l, owing to the insistent demands of the ambassador of Russia, and
after the person who tried to kill the Shah confessed and exonerated the B√°b√≠
leaders, the authorities released him from prison, but the government exiled
him from Iran. Bah√°'u'll√°h, instead of accepting the offer of refuge from
Russia, chose to go to Iraq in the Ottoman Empire; in 1853 Bah√°'u'll√°h and
his family travelled from Persia arriving in Baghdad on 8 April 1853. Baghdad.
The B√°b had eliminated the institution of successorship or vicegerency to his
movement, and had stated that no other person's writings would be binding after
his death until Him Whom God shall make manifest would appear. He did, however,
appoint M√≠rz√° Yahy√° (later known as Subh-i-Azal) as a nominal leader after
himself. M√≠rz√° Yahy√° had gone into hiding after the assassination attempt on
the Shah, and after Bah√°'u'll√°h's exile to Baghdad, he chose to join his
brother there. At the same time, an increasing number of B√°b√≠s considered
Baghdad the new center for leadership of the B√°b√≠ religion, and a flow of
pilgrims started coming there from Persia. M√≠rz√° Yahy√°'s leadership was
controversial. He generally absented himself from the B√°b√≠ community,
spending his time in Baghdad in hiding and disguise; on several occasions he
went so far as to publicly disavow allegiance to the B√°b. M√≠rz√° Yahy√°
gradually alienated himself from a large proportion of the B√°b√≠s who started
to give their alliance to other claimants. During the time that M√≠rz√° Yahy√°
remained in hiding, Bah√°'u'll√°h performed much of the daily administration of
the B√°b√≠ affairs. In contrast to M√≠rz√° Yahy√°, Bah√°'u'll√°h was outgoing
and accessible and he was seen by an increasing number of B√°b√≠s as a
religious leader, rather than just an organizer, and became their center of
devotion. This was increasingly resented by M√≠rz√° Yahy√°, who began trying to
discredit Bah√°'u'll√°h, which resulted in driving many people away from the
religion. Tensions in the community mounted, and thus in 1854 Bah√°'u'll√°h
decided to leave the city to pursue a solitary life. Kurdistan. On 10 April
1854, Bah√°'u'll√°h left his family to the care of his brother Mirza Musa and
traveled with one companion to the mountains of Kurdistan, northeast of
Baghdad, near the city of Sulaymaniyah. He later wrote that he left so as to
avoid becoming the source of disagreement within the B√°b√≠ community, and that
his "withdrawal contemplated no return". For two years, Bah√°'u'll√°h lived
alone in the mountains of Kurdistan. He originally lived as a hermit, dressed
like a dervish and using the name "Darvish Muhammad-i-Irani". At one point
someone noticed his penmanship, which brought the curiosity of the instructors
of the local Sufi orders. As he began to take guests, he became noted for his
learning and wisdom. Shaykh `Uthm√°n, Shaykh `Abdu'r-Rahm√°n, and Shaykh
Ism√°'√≠l, leaders of the Naqshband√≠yyih, Q√°dir√≠yyih, and Kh√°lid√≠yyih
Orders respectively, began to seek his advice. It was to the second of these
that the "Four Valleys" was written. Bah√°'u'll√°h wrote several other notable
books during this time. In Baghdad, given the lack of firm and public
leadership by Mirza Yahya, the Babi community had fallen into disarray. Some
Babis, including Bah√°'u'll√°h's family, began searching for Bah√°'u'll√°h, and
when news of a man living in the mountains under the name of Darvish Muhammad
spread to neighboring areas, Bah√°'u'll√°h's family begged him to come back to
Baghdad. On 19 March 1856, after two years in Kurdistan he returned to Baghdad.
Return to Baghdad. When Bah√°'u'll√°h returned to Baghdad he saw that the
B√°b√≠ community had become disheartened and divided. During Bah√°'u'll√°h's
absence, it had become alienated from the religion because Mirza Yahya had
continued his policy of militancy and been unable to provide effective
leadership. Mirza Yahya had married the widow of the B√°b against the B√°b's
clear instructions; dispatched followers to the province of Nur for the second
attempt on the life of the Shah; and instigated violence against prominent
B√°b√≠s who had challenged his leadership. After his return to Baghdad,
Bah√°'u'll√°h tried to revive the B√°b√≠ community, mostly through
correspondence, writing extensively to give the B√°b√≠s a new understanding of
the B√°b√≠ religion, while keeping his perceived station as the one promised by
the B√°b and a Manifestation of God hidden. He was soon recognized by the
B√°b√≠s, as well as government authorities, as the foremost B√°b√≠ leader, and
there was a growing number of people joining the B√°b√≠ movement. He also
gained sympathy from government officials and Sunni clerics. Bah√°'u'll√°h's
rising influence in the city, and the revival of the Persian B√°b√≠ community,
gained the attention of his enemies in Islamic clergy and the Persian
government. The Persian government asked the Ottoman government to extradite
Bah√°'u'll√°h to Persia, but the Ottoman government refused and instead chose
to move Bah√°'u'll√°h from the sensitive border region to Constantinople.
Declaration in the Garden of Ridvan. On 21 April 1863, Bah√°'u'll√°h left
Baghdad and entered the Najibiyyih gardens, now known to Bah√°'√≠s as the
Garden of Ridv√°n, near Baghdad. Bah√°'u'll√°h and those accompanying him
stayed in the garden for twelve days before departing for Constantinople. It
was during this time that Bah√°'u'll√°h declared to a small group of his
companions his perceived mission and station as a Messenger of God. Bah√°'√≠s
regard this period with great significance and celebrate the twelve days that
Bah√°'u'll√°h spent in this Garden as the festival of Ridv√°n. He referred to
the period of messianic secrecy between when he claimed to have seen the Maiden
of Heaven in the S√≠y√°h-Ch√°l and his declaration as the "ayyam-i butun"
("Days of Concealment"). Bah√°'u'll√°h stated that this period was a "set time
of concealment". The declaration in the Garden of Ridv√°n was the beginning of
a new phase in the B√°b√≠ community which led to the emergence of the Bah√°'√≠
Faith as a distinctive movement separate from B√°b√≠sm. Imprisonment.
Bah√°'u'll√°h was given an order to relocate to the Ottoman capital of
Constantinople. Although not a formal prisoner yet, the forced exile from
Baghdad was the beginning of a long process which would gradually move him into
further exiles and eventually to the penal colony of Akk√°, Palestine (now
Acre, Israel). Constantinople. Bah√°'u'll√°h travelled from Baghdad to
Constantinople between 3 May and 17 August 1863, accompanied by a large group
including family members and followers. During the trip, he was treated with
respect in the towns he visited, and when he reached Constantinople, he was
treated as a government guest. Why the Ottoman authorities did not permit his
extradition to Persia, but instead invited him to come to Constantinople, is
unclear. The reason may have been political because Bah√°'u'll√°h was viewed as
a person of influence. However, Bah√°'u'll√°h refused to work with the Ottoman
authorities. After three and a half months in Constantinople, he was ordered to
depart for Adrianople. The reason for this further move is also unclear. It may
have been due to pressure from the Persian ambassador, combined with
Bah√°'u'll√°h's refusal to work with the Ottoman authorities. Adrianople. From
1‚Äì12 December 1863, Bah√°'u'll√°h and his family traveled to Adrianople.
Unlike his travel to Constantinople, this journey was in the nature of an
exile. Bah√°'u'll√°h stayed in Adrianople for four and a half years, and was
the clear leader of the newly established B√°b√≠ community there.
Bah√°'u'll√°h's growing preeminence in the B√°b√≠ community and in the city at
large led to a final breach between Bah√°'u'll√°h and Mirza Yahya. In 1865,
Mirza Yahya was accused of plotting to kill Bah√°'u'll√°h. In contemporary
accounts, Mirza Yahya is reported to have tried to have Bah√°'u'll√°h
assassinated by a local barber. The barber, Muhammad `Al√≠ of Isfah√°n,
apparently refused and spread word of the danger around the community.
Bah√°'u'll√°h is reported to have counseled "on all patience, quietude and
gentleness". Eventually Mirza Yahya attempted to poison Bah√°'u'll√°h, an act
that left him gravely ill for a time, and left him with a shaking hand for the
rest of his life. After this event in 1866, Bah√°'u'll√°h made his claim to be
"Him Whom God Shall Make Manifest public", as well as making a formal written
announcement to Mirza Yahya referring to his followers for the first time as
the ""people of Bah√°"". After his public announcement, Bah√°'u'll√°h secluded
himself in his house and instructed the B√°b√≠s to choose between himself and
Mirza Yahya. Bah√°'u'll√°h's claims threatened Mirza Yahya's position as leader
of the religion since it would mean little to be leader of the B√°b√≠s if "Him
Whom God Shall Make Manifest" were to appear and start a new religion. Mirza
Yahya responded by making his own claims, but his attempt to preserve the
traditional B√°b√≠sm was largely unpopular, and his followers became the
minority. In 1867, Mirza Yahya challenged Bah√°'u'll√°h to a test of the divine
will in a local mosque in Adrianople, such that "God would strike down the
impostor." Bah√°'u'll√°h agreed, and went to the Sultan Selim mosque at the
appointed time, but Mirza Yahya lost face and lost credibility when he refused
to show up. Eventually Bah√°'u'll√°h was recognized by the vast majority of
B√°b√≠s as "He whom God shall make manifest" and his followers began calling
themselves Bah√°'√≠s. Writings and letters to the leaders of the world. During
his time in Adrianople, Bah√°'u'll√°h wrote a great deal. One of the main
themes during this time was the proclamation of his claimed mission; he
instructed some of his followers to take his claims to B√°b√≠s in Iran and Iraq
who had not heard of his statements, as well as asking the Bah√°'√≠s to be
united and detached from the world. He also started to write about distinctive
Bah√°'√≠ beliefs and practices. Also, while in Adrianople, Bah√°'u'll√°h
proclaimed the Bah√°'√≠ Faith further by addressing tablets to the kings and
rulers of the world asking them to accept his revelation, renounce their
material possessions, work together to settle disputes, and endeavour toward
the betterment of the world and its peoples. His first letter was sent to
Sultan Abd√ºlaziz of the Ottoman Empire and his ministers, which was followed
by the Tablet of the Kings which was a general address to all rulers. In that
latter letter the rulers of the earth were asked to listen to Bah√°'u'll√°h's
call, and cast away their material possessions, and since they were given the
reins of government that they should rule with justice and protect the rights
of the downtrodden. He also told the rulers to reduce their armaments and
reconcile their differences. The Christian monarchs were also asked to be
faithful to Jesus' call to follow the promised "Spirit of Truth." `Akk√°. With
the B√°b√≠ community now irrevocably divided, the followers of Mirza Yahya
tried to discredit Bah√°'u'll√°h to the Ottoman authorities, accusing him of
causing agitation against the government. While an investigation cleared
Bah√°'u'll√°h, it did bring to the attention of the government that
Bah√°'u'll√°h and Mirza Yahya were propagating religious claims, and, fearing
that this might cause future disorder, they decided to again exile the 'B√°b√≠'
leaders. A royal command was issued in July 1868 condemning the B√°b√≠s to
perpetual imprisonment and isolation in far-flung outposts of the Ottoman
Empire¬ ‚Äî Famagusta, Cyprus for Mirza Yahya and his followers, and `Akk√°, in
Ottoman Palestine, for Bah√°'u'll√°h and his followers. The Bah√°'√≠s,
including Bah√°'u'll√°h and his family, left Adrianople on 12 August 1868, and,
after a journey by land and sea through Gallipoli and Egypt, arrived in `Akk√°
on 31 August and were confined in the barracks in the citadel in the city. The
inhabitants of `Akk√° were told that the new prisoners were enemies of the
state, of God and his religion, and that association with them was strictly
forbidden. The first years in `Akk√° imposed very harsh conditions with
everyone becoming sick, and eventually three Bah√°'√≠s dying. It was also a
very trying time for Bah√°'u'll√°h: Mirz√° Mihd√≠, Bah√°'u'll√°h's son, was
suddenly killed at the age of twenty-two when he fell through a skylight while
pacing back and forth in prayer and meditation. After some time, the people and
officials began to trust and respect Bah√°'u'll√°h, and thus the conditions of
the imprisonment were eased and eventually, after the Sultan's death, he was
allowed to leave the city and visit nearby places. From 1877 until 1879
Bah√°'u'll√°h lived in the house of Mazra'ih. Final years. The final years of
Bah√°'u'll√°h's life (1879‚Äì1892) were spent in the Mansion of Bahj√≠, just
outside `Akk√°, even though he was still formally a prisoner of the Ottoman
Empire. During his years in `Akk√° and Bahj√≠, since `Abdu'l-Bah√°, his eldest
son, had taken care of the organizational work, Bah√°'u'll√°h was able to
devote his time to writing, and he produced many volumes of work including the
Kit√°b-i-Aqdas, his book of laws. His other works included letters outlining
his vision for a united world, as well as the need for ethical action; he also
composed many prayers. On 9 May 1892, Bah√°'u'll√°h contracted a slight fever
which grew steadily over the following days, abated, and then finally took his
life on 29 May 1892. He was buried in the shrine located next to the Mansion of
Bahj√≠. Claims. Bah√°'u'll√°h stated that he was a messenger of God, and he
used the term Manifestation of God to define the concept of an intermediary
between humanity and God. In the Bah√°'√≠ writings, the Manifestations of God
are a series of interrelated personages who speak with a divine voice and who
reflect the attributes of the divine into the human world for the progress and
advancement of human morals and civilization. The Manifestations of God, as
explained by Bah√°'u'll√°h, are not incarnations of God, but have a two-fold
station; one which is the divine in that they reveal God's attributes, but not
God's essence, and one which is human in that they represent the physical
qualities of common man, and have human limitations. Bah√°'u'll√°h wrote that
God will never manifest his essence into the world. In Bah√°'u'll√°h's writings
he writes in many styles including cases were he speaks as if he was instructed
by God to bring a message; in other cases he writes as though he is speaking as
God directly. In his writings, Bah√°'u'll√°h's style changes frequently, where
in some cases he is speaking as the messenger of God, and then it changes to as
if he were speaking as God. Some have interpreted Bah√°'u'll√°h's writing style
to conclude that Bah√°'u'll√°h had claimed divinity. Bah√°'u'll√°h, however,
states himself that the essence of God will never descend into the human world.
Statements where Bah√°'u'll√°h speaks with the voice of God are meant that he
is not actually God, but that he is speaking with the attributes of God.
Bah√°'u'll√°h declared, as the most recent Manifestation of God, that he was
the "Promised One" of all religions, fulfilling the messianic prophecies found
in world religions. He stated that his claims to being several messiahs
converging in one person were the symbolic, rather than literal, fulfilment of
the messianic and eschatological prophecies found in the literature of the
major religions. Bah√°'u'll√°h's eschatological claims constitute six
distinctive messianic identifications: from Judaism, the incarnation of the
"Everlasting Father" from the "Yuletide prophecy" of Isaiah 9:6, the "Lord of
Hosts"; from Christianity, the "Spirit of Truth" or Comforter predicted by
Jesus in his farewell discourse of John 14-17 and the return of Christ "in the
glory of the Father"; from Zoroastrianism, the return of Shah Bahram Varjavand,
a Zoroastrian messiah predicted in various late Pahlavi texts; from Shi'a Islam
the return of the Third Imam, Imam Husayn; from Sunni Islam, the return of
Jesus (Isa); and from B√°bism, He whom God shall make manifest. While
Bah√°'u'll√°h did not himself directly claim to be either the Hindu or Buddhist
messiah, he did so in principle through his writings. Later, `Abdu'l-Bah√°
stated that Bah√°'u'll√°h was the Kalki avatar, who in the classical Hindu
Vaishnavas tradition is the tenth and final Avatar (great incarnation) of
Vishnu who will come to end The Age of Darkness and Destruction. Bah√°'√≠s also
believe that Bah√°'u'll√°h is the fulfilment of the prophecy of appearance of
the Maitreya Buddha, who is a future Buddha who will eventually appear on
earth, achieve complete enlightenment, and teach the pure Dharma. Bah√°'√≠s
believe that the prophecy that Maitreya will usher in a new society of
tolerance and love has been fulfilled by Bah√°'u'll√°h's teachings on world
peace. Bah√°'u'll√°h is believed to be a descendant of a long line of kings in
Persia through Yazdgerd III, the last monarch of the Sasanian Dynasty; he also
asserted to be a descendant of Abraham through his third wife Keturah.
Succession. After Bah√°'u'll√°h died on 29 May 1892, the Will and Testament of
Bah√°'u'll√°h named his son `Abdu'l-Bah√° as Centre of the Covenant, successor
and interpreter of Bah√°'u'll√°h's writings, and the appointment was readily
accepted by almost all Bah√°'√≠s, since the appointment was written and
unambiguous, and `Abdu'l-Bah√° had proved himself a capable and devoted
assistant. However, the appointment given to `Abdu'l-Bah√° was a cause of
jealousy within Bah√°'u'll√°h's family. Bah√°'u'll√°h had also stated that
another one of his sons M√≠rz√° Muhammad `Al√≠ was to be subordinate and second
in rank after `Abdu'l-Bah√°. , however, insisted that `Abdu'l-Bah√° was
exceeding his powers, and started a rebellion, at first covert, and then public
to discredit `Abdu'l-Bah√°. 's actions, however, were rejected by the majority
of the Bah√°'√≠s. Due to this conflict, `Abdu'l-Bah√° later ex-communicated his
brother as a covenant-breaker. The conflict was not long lived; after being
alienated by the Bah√°'√≠ community, Muhammad Ali died in 1937 with a handful
of followers. Works. Bah√°'u'll√°h wrote many books, tablets and prayers, of
which only a fraction have been translated into English. There have been 15,000
works written by him identified; many of these are in the form of short
letters, or tablets, to Bah√°'√≠s, but he also wrote larger pieces including
the Book of Certitude, the Hidden Words and the Gems of Divine Mysteries. The
total volume of his works are more than 70 times the size of the Qur'an and
more than 15 times the size of the Old and New Testaments of the Bible. The
books and letters written by Bah√°'u'll√°h cover religious doctrine, the
proclamation of his claims, social and moral teachings as well as Bah√°'√≠
laws; he also wrote many prayers. Jin√°b-i-F√°dil-i-M√°zindar√°n√≠, analyzing
Baha'u'llah's writings, states that he wrote in the different styles or
categories including the interpretation of religious scripture, the enunciation
of laws and ordinances, mystical writings, writings about government and world
order, including letters to the kings and rulers of the world, writings about
knowledge, philosophy, medicine, and alchemy, writings calling for education,
good character and virtues, and writing about social teachings. All of his
works are considered by Bah√°'√≠s to be revelation, even those that were
written before his announcement of his prophetic claim. Some of his better
known works that have been translated into English include Gleanings, the
Hidden Words, the Kit√°b-i-Aqdas and the Kit√°b-i-√çq√°n. Photographs and
imagery. There are two known photographs of Bah√°'u'll√°h. This photo was taken
for passport purposes while he was in Adrianople (present day Edirne) and is
reproduced in William Miller's book on the Bah√°'√≠ Faith. Copies of both
pictures are at the Bah√°'√≠ World Centre, and one is on display in the
International Archives building, where the Bah√°'√≠s view it as part of an
organized pilgrimage. Outside of this experience Bah√°'√≠s prefer not to view
this photo in public, or even to display it in their private homes, and
Bah√°'√≠ institutions have requested the press not to publish the image in the
media. Bah√°'u'll√°h's image is not in itself offensive to Bah√°'√≠s. However,
Bah√°'√≠s are expected to treat the image of any Manifestation of God with
extreme reverence. According to this practice, they avoid depictions of Jesus
or of Muhammad, and refrain from portraying any of them in plays and drama.
Copies of the photographs are displayed on highly significant occasions, such
as six conferences held in October 1967 commemorating the hundredth anniversary
of Bah√°'u'll√°h's writing of the "Suriy-i-Mul√∫k" (Tablet to the Kings), which
Shoghi Effendi describes as "the most momentous Tablet revealed by
Bah√°'u'll√°h". After a meeting in Adrianople, the Hands of the Cause traveled
to the conferences, 'each bearing the precious trust of a photograph of the
Blessed Beauty, which it will be the privilege of those attending the
Conferences to view.'
