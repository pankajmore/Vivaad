Sephardi Jews Sephardi Jews () is a general term referring to the descendants
of Spanish and Portuguese Jews who lived or live in the Iberian Peninsula. It
can also refer to those who use a Sephardic style of liturgy, or would
otherwise define themselves in terms of Jewish customs and traditions from the
Iberian Peninsula. Accordingly, the term Sephardic Jew refers to Jews who
follow Sephardic Halakha. The term essentially means "Spanish". It comes from
Sepharad (), a Biblical location. This location is disputed, but "Sepharad" was
identified by later Jews as the Iberian Peninsula, and still means "Spain" in
modern Hebrew. In other languages and scripts, "Sephardi" translates as plural
; ; ; ; ; ; ; "Sephardites"; "Sefaradi"; ; "Sefardi"; , Judaeo-Spanish:
"Sefaradies/Sefaradim"; and "SafƒÅrdiyy≈´n". Definition. A Sephardi Jew is a
Jew descended from, or who follows the customs and traditions followed by, Jews
who lived in the Iberian Peninsula (Portugal and modern Spain), before their
expulsion in the late 15th century. This includes both the descendants of Jews
expelled from Spain under the Alhambra decree of 1492, or from Portugal by
order of King Manuel I in 1497, and the descendants of crypto-Jews who left the
Peninsula in later centuries to North Africa, Asia Minor, the Philippines and
elsewhere around the world, and the descendants of crypto-Jews who remained in
Iberia. In modern times, the term has also been applied to Jews who may not
have been born Sephardi (or even Jewish) but attend Sephardic synagogues and
practice Sephardic traditions. Today there are around 12,000 Jews in Spain and
2,500 in Portugal (although it must be taken into account that, when expelled
from Portugal, Jews were allowed to stay if they converted to Christianity,
resulting in a high percentage being assimilated in the Portuguese population.
See: History of the Jews in Portugal). There is also a community of 600 in
Gibraltar. These are not necessarily Sephardi as defined above. The name comes
from Sepharad ( ; ), a Biblical location. This was probably the "Saparda"
mentioned in Persian inscriptions: the location of that is disputed, but may
have been Sardis in Asia Minor. "Sepharad" was identified by later Jews as the
Iberian Peninsula, and still means "Spain" in modern Hebrew. For religious
purposes, and in modern Israel, "Sephardim" is often used in a wider sense to
include most Jews of Asian and African origin, who use a Sephardic style of
liturgy. This article is mostly concerned with Sephardim in the narrower ethnic
sense, rather than in this broader Modern Israeli Hebrew definition. "See also:
" "Jewish ethnic divisions". The term "Sephardi" can also describe the "nusach"
(Hebrew language, "liturgical tradition") used by Sephardi Jews in their Siddur
(prayer book). A "nusach" is defined by a liturgical tradition's choice of
prayers, order of prayers, text of prayers and melodies used in the singing of
prayers. Sephardim traditionally pray using Minhag Sefarad, which is quite
similar to Nusach Edot haMizrach (liturgy of the Eastern Congregations). For
more details of the Sephardic liturgy see "Sephardic Judaism"." "Note that the
term "Nusach Sefard" or "Nusach Sfarad" does not refer to the liturgy generally
recited by Sephardim, but rather to an alternative Eastern European liturgy
used by many Hasidim." Divisions. Historically, Sephardim are those Jews
associated with the Iberian Peninsula. From the perspective of the present day,
the first three sub-groups look in retrospect like separate branches, each with
its own traditions, though some degree of merger is taking place as Spanish and
Portuguese congregations increasingly include Jews of other backgrounds. In
earlier centuries, and as late as the editing of the Jewish Encyclopedia at the
beginning of the twentieth century, they were usually regarded as together
forming a continuum, with the Jewish community of Livorno acting as the
clearing-house of personnel and traditions between the three sub-groups as well
as the main publishing centre. Sephardim and Mizrahim. For religious purposes,
the term "Sephardim" means all Jews who use a Sephardic style of liturgy, and
therefore includes most Jews of Middle Eastern background, whether or not they
have any historical connection to the Iberian Peninsula. Most of these
communities (with some exceptions such as the Yemenites) do in fact use much
the same religious ritual as the Sephardim proper and, like them, base their
religious law on the Shulchan Aruch without the glosses of Moses Isserles. When
used in this sense, "Sephardim" should be translated not as "Spanish Jews" but
as "Jews of the Spanish rite". (In the same way, "Ashkenazim" means "Jews of
the German rite", whether or not their families actually originate in Germany.)
Accordingly, in the vernacular of modern-day Jews in Israel and worldwide,
especially many Ashkenazi Jews, "Sephardi" has become an umbrella term for any
Jew who is not Ashkenazi. This nomenclature is often perceived as
unsatisfactory, and a variety of other terms have been coined. A term in common
use for non-Ashkenazi Jewish communities that historically are not of Spanish
descent is Mizrahim, which in Hebrew means "Easterners". In current use,
Mizrahi Jews is a convenient way to refer collectively to a wide range of
Jewish communities, most of which are as unrelated to each other as they are to
either the Sephardi (in the narrower sense) or Ashkenazi communities. They
include in particular the communities living in, or coming from, Southern
Arabia (Yemen), Mesopotamia (Iraq), Syria, Persia (Iran) and India. The
distinction between Sephardim and Mizrahim is not watertight as many
communities (e.g. Syrian Jews) are ethnically speaking a mixture between local
Jews and later arrivals of Jews from Spain and Portugal. Moroccan and other
North African Jews (sometimes known as "Maghrebi Jews") are closely associated
with the Sephardim proper (Jews of Iberian descent), both because the Jewish
community of Al-Andalus was itself partly of Maghrebi Jewish origin and because
many Sephardim settled in North Africa after their expulsion from Spain.
Distribution. Prior to 1492, substantial Jewish populations existed in most
Spanish provinces. Among the more prominent were in Toledo, C√≥rdoba, Seville,
M√°laga and Granada. Smaller towns such as Oca√±a, Guadalajara, Buitrago de
Lozoya, Lucena, Ribadavia, Herv√°s, and Almaz√°n were founded or inhabited
principally by Jews. In Castile, Aranda de Duero, √Åvila, Alba de Tormes,
Ar√©valo, Burgos, Calahorra, Carri√≥n de los Condes, Cu√©llar, Herrera del
Duque, Le√≥n, Medina del Campo, Ourense, Salamanca, Segovia, Soria, and
Villal√≥n were home to large Jewish communities or "aljamas". Aragon and
Catalonia had substantial Jewish communities in the famous Calls of Girona,
Barcelona, Tarragona, Valencia and Palma (Majorca). The first Jews to leave
Spain settled in what is nowadays Algeria (such as in Oran and Tlemcen) after
the massacre in Catalonia that took place in 1391. Following the 1492 expulsion
from Spain, and the subsequent expulsions in Portugal (1497), these Jews, the
nascent Sephardim, settled mainly in the Ottoman Empire (primarily in the
province of Bosnia, Anatolia, the Levant and Ottoman North Africa), Morocco and
Algeria, southern France, Italy, Spanish North America (Puerto Rico, Cuba, the
Dominican Republic, New Mexico, Texas (Tejano), Arizona, and Mexico), Spanish
South America and Portuguese Brazil and Goa, as well as the Netherlands, whence
a number of families continued on to the former Dutch possessions of Cura√ßao,
Suriname, Aruba and New Netherland (now New York), England (as well as English
colonies such as Barbados and Jamaica), Germany, Denmark, Poland, Austria and
Hungary. As a result of the Jewish exodus from Arab lands, many of the
Sephardim from the Middle East and North Africa relocated to either Israel or
France, where they form a significant portion of the Jewish communities today.
Other significant communities also exist in New York City, Argentina, Montreal,
and Gibraltar. Language. The most typical traditional language of Sephardim is
Judeo-Spanish, also called Judezmo or "Ladino". It is a Romance language
derived mainly from Old Castilian (Spanish), with many borrowings from Turkish,
and to a lesser extent from Greek, Arabic, Hebrew, and French. Until recently,
two different dialects of Judeo-Spanish were spoken in the Mediterranean
region: Eastern Judeo-Spanish (in various distinctive regional variations) and
Western or North African Judeo-Spanish (also known as Haketia), once spoken,
with little regional distinction, in six towns in Northern Morocco and, because
of later emigration, also in Ceuta and Melilla (Spanish cities in North
Africa), Gibraltar (British Overseas Territory), Casablanca (Morocco), and Oran
(Algeria). The Eastern Sephardic dialect is typified by its greater
conservatism, its retention of numerous Old Spanish features in phonology,
morphology, and lexicon, and its numerous borrowings from Turkish and, to a
lesser extent, also from Greek and South Slavic. Both dialects have (or had)
numerous borrowings from Hebrew, especially in reference to religious matters,
but the number of Hebraisms in everyday speech or writing is in no way
comparable to that found in Yiddish. On the other hand the North African
Sephardic dialect was, until the early 20th century, also highly conservative;
its abundant Colloquial Arabic loan words retained most of the Arabic phonemes
as functional components of a new, enriched Hispano-Semitic phonological
system. During the Spanish colonial occupation of Northern Morocco
(1912‚Äì1956), was subjected to pervasive, massive influence from Modern
Standard Spanish and most Moroccan Jews now speak a colloquial, Andalusian form
of Spanish, with only an occasional use of the old language as a sign of in-
group solidarity, somewhat as American Jews may now use an occasional
Yiddishism in colloquial speech. Except for certain younger individuals, who
continue to practice as a matter of cultural pride, this splendid dialect,
probably the most Arabized of the Romance languages apart from Mozarabic, has
essentially ceased to exist. By constrast , Eastern Judeo-Spanish has fared
somewhat better, especially in Israel, where newspapers, radio broadcasts, and
elementary school and university programs strive to keep the language alive.
But the old regional variations (i.e. Bosnia, Macedonia, Bulgaria, Romania,
Greece, Turkey, and Italy for instance) are already either extinct or doomed to
extinction. Only time will tell whether Judeo-Spanish koin√©, now evolving in
Israel‚Äîsimilar to that which developed among Sephardic immigrants to the
United States early in the 20th century will prevail and survive into the next
generation. Jud√¶o-Portuguese was used by Sephardim¬ ‚Äî especially among the
Spanish and Portuguese Jews of Western Europe. The pidgin forms of Portuguese
spoken among slaves and their Sephardic owners were an influence in the
development of Papiamento and the Creole languages of Suriname. Other Romance
languages with Jewish forms, spoken historically by Sephardim, include Jud√¶o-
Aragonese and Jud√¶o-Catalan (or Catalanic). The Gibraltar community has had a
heavy influence on the Gibraltar dialect Llanito contributing several words to
this English/Spanish patois. Other languages associated with Sephardic Jews are
mostly extinct, "i.e.", formerly spoken by some Sephardic communities in Italy.
Judeo-Arabic and its dialects have been a large vernacular language for
Sephardim who settled in North African kingdoms and Arabic-speaking parts of
the Ottoman Empire. Low German. (Low Saxon), formerly used as the vernacular by
Sephardim around Hamburg and Altona in Northern Germany, is also no longer in
use as a specifically Jewish vernacular. In other words, through their
diaspora, Sephardim have been a polyglot population, often learning or
exchanging words with the language of their host population, most commonly
Arabic, Greek, Turkish, Dutch or Italian and were easily integrated in the
societies that hosted them. Within the last centuries and more particularly the
19th and 20th century, two languages have became dominant in the Sephardic
diaspora; French introduced by the Alliance Isra√©lite Universelle and Hebrew
by the state of Israel. History. Early history. The precise origins of the
Jewish communities of the Iberian peninsula are unclear. There is fragmentary
and inconclusive evidence of a Jewish presence on the Iberian Peninsula dating
from pre-Roman times. More substantial references date from the Roman period.
It is thought that substantial Jewish immigration probably occurred during the
Roman period of Hispania. The province came under Roman control with the fall
of Carthage after the Second Punic War (218‚Äì202 BC). Exactly how soon after
this time Jews made their way onto the scene in this context is a matter of
speculation. It is within the realm of possibility that they went there under
the Romans as free men to take advantage of its rich resources. Although the
spread of Jews into Europe is most commonly associated with the Diaspora that
ensued from the Roman conquest of Judea, emigration from Judea into the greater
Roman Mediterranean area antedated the destruction of Jerusalem at the hands of
the Romans under Titus. Any Jews already in Hispania at this time would have
been joined by those who had been enslaved by the Romans under Vespasian and
Titus, and dispersed to the extreme west during the period of the Jewish Wars,
and especially after the defeat of Judea in 70. One account placed the number
carried off to Hispania at 80,000. Subsequent immigrations came into the area
along both the northern African and southern European sides of the
Mediterranean. Among the earliest records that may refer specifically to Jews
in the Iberian peninsula during the Roman period is Paul's Epistle to the
Romans. Many have taken Paul's intention to go to Hispania to preach the gospel
(Romans 15:24, 28) to indicate the presence of Jewish communities there, as
well as the fact that Herod Antipas's banishment by Caligula in the year 39 may
have been to Hispania. From a slightly later period, "Midrash Rabbah,"
Leviticus 29:2 makes reference to the return of the Diaspora from Hispania by
165. Perhaps the most direct and substantial of early references are the
several decrees of the Council of Elvira, convened in the early fourth century,
which address proper Christian behavior with regard to the Jews of Hispania. As
citizens of the Roman Empire, the Jews of Hispania engaged in a variety of
occupations, including agriculture. Until the adoption of Christianity, Jews
had close relations with non-Jewish populations, and played an active role in
the social and economic life of the province. The edicts of the Synod of
Elvira, provide evidence of Jews who were integrated enough into the greater
community to cause alarm among some. Of the Council's 80 canonic decisions,
those that pertain to Jews maintained separation between the two communities.
It seems that by this time the presence of Jews was of greater concern to
Christian authorities than the presence of pagans. Canon 16, which prohibited
marriage of Christians with Jews, was worded more strongly than canon 15, which
prohibited marriage with pagans. Canon 78 threatens Christians who commit
adultery with Jews with ostracism. Canon 48 forbade the blessing of Christian
crops by Jews, and canon 50 forbade the sharing of meals by Christians and
Jews. Yet in comparison to Jewish life in Byzantium and Italy, life for the
early Jews in Hispania and the rest of western Europe was relatively tolerable.
This is due in large measure to the difficulty the Church had in establishing
itself in its western frontier. In the west, Germanic tribes such as the Suevi,
the Vandals, and especially the Visigoths had more or less disrupted the
political and ecclesiastical systems of the Roman empire, and for several
centuries western Jews enjoyed a degree of peace their brethren to the east did
not. Barbarian invasions brought most of the Iberian Peninsula under Visigothic
rule by the early fifth century. Other than in their contempt for Orthodox
Christians, who reminded them of the Romans and also because they were Arians,
the Visigoths were largely uninterested in the religious creeds within their
kingdom. It was not until 506, when Alaric II (484‚Äì507) published his
"Brevarium Alaricianum" (Breviary of Alaric) (wherein he adopted the laws of
the ousted Romans), that a Visigothic king concerned himself with the Jews. The
situation of the Jews changed after the conversion of the Visigothic royal
family under Recared from Arianism to Roman Catholicism in 587. In their desire
to consolidate the realm under the new religion, the Visigoths adopted an
aggressive policy towards Jews. As the king and the church acted in a single
interest, the Jews' situation deteriorated. Under successive Visigothic kings
and under ecclesiastical authority, many orders of expulsion, forced
conversion, isolation, enslavement, execution, and other punitive measures were
made. By 612‚Äì621, the situation for Jews became intolerable and many left
Spain for nearby northern Africa. In 711, thousands of Jews from North Africa
accompanied the Moslems who invaded Spain, subsuming Catholic Spain and turning
much of it into an Arab state, Al-Andalus. (N.H.Finkelstein, p.¬ 13, 14) The
Jews of Hispania had been utterly embittered and alienated by Catholic rule by
the time of the Muslim invasion. To them, the Moors were perceived as, and
indeed were, a liberating force. Wherever they went, the Muslims were greeted
by Jews eager to aid them in administering the country. In many conquered towns
the garrison was left in the hands of the Jews before the Muslims proceeded
further north. This began two centuries of Muslim rule in the Iberian
peninsula, which became known as the "Golden Age" of Sephardi Jewry. Jews in
Muslim Iberia. With the victory of Tariq ibn Ziyad in 711, the lives of the
Sephardim changed dramatically. Though Islamic law placed restrictions on
"dhimmis" (non-Muslim members of monotheistic faiths), the coming of the Moors
was by and large welcomed by the Jews of Iberia. Both Muslim and Christian
sources claim that Jews provided valuable aid to the Muslim invaders. Once
captured, the defense of Cordoba was left in the hands of Jews, and Granada,
Malaga, Seville, and Toledo were left to a mixed army of Jews and Moors.
Although in some towns Jews may have been helpful to Muslim success, they were
of limited impact overall. However it was frequently claimed by Christians in
later centuries that the fall of Iberia was due in large part to Jewish
perfidy. In spite of the restrictions placed upon the Jews as "dhimmis", life
under Muslim rule was one of great opportunity and Jews flourished as they did
not under the Christian Visigoths. Many Jews came to Iberia, seen as a land of
tolerance and opportunity, from the Christian and Muslim worlds. Following
initial Arab victories, and especially with the establishment of Umayyad rule
by Abd al-Rahman I in 755, the native Jewish community was joined by Jews from
the rest of Europe, as well as from Arab lands, from Morocco to Babylon. Jewish
communities were enriched culturally, intellectually, and religiously by the
commingling of these diverse Jewish traditions. Arabic culture, of course, also
made a lasting impact on Sephardic cultural development. General re-evaluation
of scripture was prompted by Muslim anti-Jewish polemics and the spread of
rationalism, as well as the anti-Rabbanite polemics of Karaite sectarianism
(which was inspired by various Muslim schismatic movements). The cultural and
intellectual achievements of the Arabs, and much of the scientific and
philosophical speculation of Ancient Greek culture, which had been best
preserved by Arab scholars, was made available to the educated Jew. The
meticulous regard the Arabs had for grammar and style also had the effect of
stimulating an interest in philological matters in general among Jews. Arabic
became the main language of Sephardic science, philosophy, and everyday
business, as had been the case with Babylonian "geonim". This thorough adoption
of the Arabic language also greatly facilitated the assimilation of Jews into
Moorish culture, and Jewish activity in a variety of professions, including
medicine, commerce, finance, and agriculture increased. By the ninth century,
some members of the Sephardic community felt confident enough to take part in
proselytizing amongst Christians. Most famous were the heated correspondences
sent between Bodo Eleazar, a former Christian deacon who had converted to
Judaism in 838, and the Bishop of C√≥rdoba Paulus Albarus, who had converted
from Judaism to Christianity. Each man, using such epithets as "wretched
compiler", tried to convince the other to return to his former faith, to no
avail. The Golden Age is most closely identified with the reign of Abd al-
Rahman III (882‚Äì942), the first independent Caliph of Cordoba, and in
particular with the career of his Jewish councilor, Hasdai ibn Shaprut
(882‚Äì942). Within this context of cultural patronage, studies in Hebrew,
literature, and linguistics flourished. Hasdai benefitted world Jewry not only
indirectly by creating a favorable environment for scholarly pursuits within
Iberia, but also by using his influence to intervene on behalf of foreign Jews:
in his letter to Byzantine Princess Helena, he requested protection for the
Jews under Byzantine rule, attesting to the fair treatment of the Christians of
"al-Andalus", and perhaps indicating that such was contingent on the treatment
of Jews abroad. One notable contribution to Christian intellectualism is Ibn
Gabirol's neo-Platonic "Fons Vitae" ("The Source of Life;" "Mekor Hayyim").
Thought by many to have been written by a Christian, this work was admired by
Christians and studied in monasteries throughout the Middle Ages, though the
work of Solomon Munk in the 19th century proved that the author of "Fons Vitae"
was the Jewish ibn Gabirol. In addition to contributions of original work, the
Sephardim were active as translators. Mainly in Toledo, texts were translated
between Greek, Arabic, Hebrew, and Latin. In translating the great works of
Arabic, Hebrew, and Greek into Latin, Iberian Jews were instrumental in
bringing the fields of science and philosophy, which formed much of the basis
of Renaissance learning, into the rest of Europe. In the early 11th century
centralized authority based at Cordoba broke down following the Berber invasion
and the ousting of the Umayyads. In its stead arose the independent "taifa"
principalities under the rule of local Arab, Berber, or Slavonic leaders.
Rather than having a stifling effect, the disintegration of the caliphate
expanded the opportunities to Jewish and other professionals. The services of
Jewish scientists, doctors, traders, poets, and scholars were generally valued
by Christian and Muslim rulers of regional centers, especially as order was
restored in recently conquered towns. Rabbi Samuel ha-Nagid (ibn Naghrela) was
the Vizier of Granada. He was succeeded by his son Joseph ibn Naghrela who was
slain by an incited mob along with most of the Jewish community. The remnant
fled to Lucena. The decline of the Golden Age began before the completion of
the Christian "Reconquista", with the penetration and influence of the
Almoravides, and then the Almohads, from North Africa. These fundamentalist
sects abhorred the liberality of the Islamic culture of "al-Andalus", including
the position of authority some "dhimmis" held over Muslims. When the Almohads
gave the Jews a choice of either death or conversion to Islam, many Jews
emigrated. Some, such as the family of Maimonides, fled south and east to the
more tolerant Muslim lands, while others went northward to settle in the
growing Christian kingdoms. Meanwhile the "Reconquista" continued in the north
throughout the 12th century. As various Arab lands fell to the Christians,
conditions for some Jews in the emerging Christian kingdoms became increasingly
favorable. As had happened during the reconstruction of towns following the
breakdown of authority under the Umayyads, the services of Jews were employed
by the victorious Christian leaders. Sephardic knowledge of the language and
culture of the enemy, their skills as diplomats and professionals, as well as
their desire for relief from intolerable conditions¬ ‚Äî the very same reasons
that they had proved useful to the Arabs in the early stages of the Muslim
invasion¬ ‚Äî made their services very valuable. However, the Jews from the
Muslim south were not entirely secure in their northward migrations. Old
prejudices were compounded by newer ones. Suspicions of complicity with the
Muslims were alive and well as Jews immigrated, speaking Arabic. However, many
of the newly arrived Jews of the north prospered during the late eleventh and
early twelfth centuries. The majority of Latin documentation regarding Jews
during this period refers to their landed property, fields, and vineyards. In
many ways life had come full circle for the Sephardim of "al-Andalus". As
conditions became more oppressive during the 12th and 13th centuries, Jews
again looked to an outside culture for relief. Christian leaders of reconquered
cities granted them extensive autonomy, and Jewish scholarship recovered
somewhat and developed as communities grew in size and importance. However, the
Reconquista Jews never reached the same heights as had those of the Golden Age.
After the Reconquista. Among the Sephardim were many who were the descendants,
or heads, of wealthy families and who, as "Marranos", had occupied prominent
positions in the countries they had left. Some had been state officials, others
had held positions of dignity within the Church; many had been the heads of
large banking-houses and mercantile establishments, and some were physicians or
scholars who had officiated as teachers in high schools. Their Spanish or
Portuguese was a lingua franca that enabled Sephardim from different countries
to engage in commerce and diplomacy. With their social equals they associated
freely, without regard to religion and more likely with regard to equivalent or
comparative education, for they were generally well read, which became a
tradition and expectation. They were received at the courts of sultans, kings,
and princes, and often were employed as ambassadors, envoys, or agents. The
number of Sephardim who have rendered important services to different countries
is considerable as Samuel Abravanel (or "Abrabanel"¬ ‚Äî financial councilor to
the viceroy of Naples). Among other names mentioned are those of Belmonte,
Nasi, Francisco Pacheco, Pedro de Herrera, Palache, Pimentel, Azevedo,
Sasportas, Salvador, Costa, Curiel, Cansino, Schonenberg, Toledo, Toledano,
Pereira and Teixeira. The Sephardim have distinguished themselves as physicians
and statesmen, and have won the favor of rulers and princes, in both the
Christian and the Islamic world. That the Sephardim were selected for prominent
positions in every country where they settled was only in part due to the fact
that Spanish had become a world-language through the expansion of Spain into
the world spanning Spanish Empire‚Äîthe cosmopolitan cultural background after
long associations with Islamic scholars of the Sephardic families also made
them extremely well educated for the times, even well into the European
Enlightenment. For a long time the Sephardim took an active part in Spanish
literature; they wrote in prose and in rhyme, and were the authors of
theological, philosophical, (aesthetic rather than content based writing),
pedagogic (teaching), and mathematical works. The rabbis, who, in common with
all the Sephardim, emphasized a pure and euphonious pronunciation of Hebrew,
delivered their sermons in Spanish or in Portuguese. Several of these sermons
have appeared in print. Their thirst for knowledge, together with the fact that
they associated freely with the outer world, led the Sephardim to establish new
educational systems. Wherever they settled, they founded schools that used
Spanish as the medium of instruction. Theatre in Istanbul was in Jud√¶o-Spanish
since it was forbidden to Muslims. In Portugal the Sephardim were given
important roles in the sociopolitical sphere and enjoyed a certain amount of
protection from the Crown (e.g. Yahia Ben Yahia, first "Rabino Maior" of
Portugal and supervisor of the public revenue of the first King of Portugal, D.
Afonso Henriques). Even with the increasing pressure from the Catholic Church
this state of affairs remained more or less constant and the number of Jews in
Portugal grew with those running from Spain. This changed with the marriage of
D. Manuel I of Portugal with the daughter of the Catholic Monarchs of the newly
born Spain. In 1497 the Decree ordering the expulsion or forced conversion of
all the Jews was passed, and the Sephardim either fled or went into secrecy
under the guise of "Crist√£os Novos", i.e. New Christians (this Decree was
symbolically revoked in 1996 by the Portuguese Parliament). Those who fled to
Genoa were only allowed to land provided they received baptism. Those who were
fortunate enough to reach the Ottoman Empire had a better fate: the Sultan
Bayezid II sarcastically sent his thanks to Ferdinand for sending him some of
his best subjects, thus "impoverishing his own lands while enriching his
(Bayezid's)". Jews arriving in the Ottoman Empire were mostly resettled in and
around Selanik ("Thessaloniki" in Greek) and to some extent in Istanbul and
ƒ∞zmir. This was followed by a great massacre of Jews in the city of Lisbon in
1506 and the establishment of the Portuguese Inquisition in 1536. This caused
the flight of the Portuguese Jewish community, which continued until the
extinction of the Courts of Inquisition in 1821; by then there were very few
Jews in Portugal. In Amsterdam, where Jews were especially prominent in the
seventeenth century on account of their number, wealth, education, and
influence, they established poetical academies after Spanish models; two of
these were the "Academia de los Sitibundos" and the "Academia de los Floridos".
In the same city they also organized the first Jewish educational institution,
with graduate classes in which, in addition to Talmudic studies, instruction
was given in the Hebrew language. The most important synagogue, or Esnoga, as
it is usually called amongst Spanish and Portuguese Jews, is the Amsterdam
Esnoga¬ ‚Äî usually considered the "mother synagogue", and the historical
centre of the Amsterdam minhag. A sizable Sephardic community had settled in
Morocco and other Northern African countries, which were colonized by France in
the 19th century. Jews in Algeria were given French citizenship in 1870 by the
"d√©cret Cr√©mieux" (previously Jews and Muslims could apply for French
citizenship, but had to renounce the use of traditional religious courts and
laws, which many did not want to do). When France withdrew from Algeria in
1962, the local Jewish communities largely relocated to France. There are some
tensions between some of those communities and the earlier French Jewish
population (who were mostly Ashkenazi Jews), and with Arabic-Muslim
communities. In the Age of Discoveries. The largest part, likely a majority, of
Spaniard Jews expelled in 1492 fled to Portugal, where they eluded persecution
for a few years. The Jewish community in Portugal was perhaps then some 10% of
that country's population. They were declared Christians by Royal decree unless
they left, but the King hindered their departure, needing their artisanship and
working population for Portugal's overseas enterprises and territories. Later
Sephardic Jews settled in many trade areas controlled by the Empire of Philip
II and others. With various countries in Europe also the Sephardi Jews
established commercial relations. In a letter dated November 25, 1622, King
Christian IV of Denmark invites Jews of Amsterdam to settle in Gl√ºckstadt,
where, among other privileges, the free exercise of their religion would be
assured to them. √Ålvaro Caminha, in Cape Verde islands, who received the land
as a grant from the crown, established a colony with Jews forced to stay on the
island of S√£o Tom√©. Pr√≠ncipe island was settled in 1500 under a similar
arrangement. Attracting settlers proved difficult, however, the Jewish
settlement was a success and their descendants settled many parts of Brazil. In
particular, Jews established the relations between the Dutch and South America.
They contributed to the establishment of the Dutch West Indies Company in 1621,
and some were members of the directorate. The ambitious schemes of the Dutch
for the conquest of Brazil were carried into effect through Francisco Ribiero,
a Portuguese captain, who is said to have had Jewish relations in Holland. Some
years afterward, when the Dutch in Brazil appealed to Holland for craftsmen of
all kinds, many Jews went to Brazil. About 600 Jews left Amsterdam in 1642,
accompanied by two distinguished scholars‚ÄîIsaac Aboab da Fonseca and Moses
Raphael de Aguilar. Jews supported the Dutch in the struggle between Holland
and Portugal for possession of Brazil. In 1642, Aboab da Fonseca was appointed
rabbi at Kahal Zur Israel Synagogue in the Dutch colony of Pernambuco (Recife),
Brazil. Most of the white inhabitants of the town were Sephardic Jews from
Portugal who had been banned by the Portuguese Inquisition to this town at the
other side of the Atlantic Ocean. In 1624, the colony had been occupied by the
Dutch. By becoming the rabbi of the community, Aboab da Fonseca was the first
appointed rabbi of the Americas. The name of his congregation was Kahal Zur
Israel Synagogue and the community had a synagogue, a mikveh and a yeshiva as
well. However, during the time he was rabbi in Pernambuco, the Portuguese re-
occupied the place again in 1654, after a struggle of nine years. Aboab da
Fonseca managed to return to Amsterdam after the occupation of the Portuguese.
Members of his community immigrated to North America and were among the
founders of New York City. Besides merchants, a great number of physicians were
among the Spanish Jews in Amsterdam: Samuel Abravanel, David Nieto, Elijah
Montalto, and the Bueno family; Joseph Bueno was consulted in the illness of
Prince Maurice (April, 1623). Jews were admitted as students at the university,
where they studied medicine as the only branch of science of practical use to
them, for they were not permitted to practise law, and the oath they would be
compelled to take excluded them from the professorships. Neither were Jews
taken into the trade-guilds: a resolution passed by the city of Amsterdam in
1632 (the cities being autonomous) excluded them. Exceptions, however, were
made in the case of trades that related to their religion: printing,
bookselling, and the selling of meat, poultry, groceries, and drugs. In 1655 a
Jew was, exceptionally, permitted to establish a sugar-refinery. The Holocaust.
The Nazi Holocaust that devastated European Jewry and virtually destroyed its
centuries-old culture also wiped out the great European population centers of
Sephardi Jewry and led to the almost complete demise of its unique language and
traditions. Sephardi Jewish communities from France and the Netherlands in the
northwest to Yugoslavia and Greece in the southeast almost disappeared. On the
eve of World War II, the European Sephardi community was concentrated in the
Balkan countries of Greece, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria. Its leading centers were
in Salonika, Sarajevo, Belgrade, and Sofia. The experience of the Balkan Jewish
communities during the war varied greatly and depended on the type of regime
under which they fell. The Jewish communities of Serbia and northern Greece,
including the 50,000 Jews of Salonika, fell under direct German occupation in
April 1941 and bore the full weight and intensity of Nazi repressive measures
from dispossession, humiliation, and forced labor to hostage taking, and
finally deportation to Auschwitz-Birkenau and extermination in March‚ÄìAugust
1943. The Jewish population of southern Greece fell under the jurisdiction of
the Italians who eschewed the enactment of anti-Jewish legislation and resisted
whenever possible German efforts to transfer them to occupied Poland, until the
surrender of Italy on September 8, 1943 brought the Jews under German control.
Sephardi Jews in Bosnia and Croatia were ruled by a German-created Independent
State of Croatia state from April 1941, which subjected them to pogrom-like
actions before herding them into local camps where they were murdered side by
side with Serbs and Roma (see Porajmos). The Jews of Macedonia and Thrace were
controlled by Bulgarian occupation forces, which after rendering them
stateless, rounded them up and turned them over to the Germans for deportation.
Finally, the Jews of Bulgaria proper were under the rule of a Nazi ally that
subjected them to ruinous anti-Jewish legislation, but ultimately yielded to
pressure from Bulgarian parliamentarians, clerics, and intellectuals not to
deport them. More than 50,000 Bulgarian Jews were thus saved. Later history and
culture. Today, the Sephardim have preserved the romances and the ancient
melodies and songs of Spain and Portugal, as well as a large number of old
Portuguese and Spanish proverbs. A number of children's plays, like, for
example, "El Castillo", are still popular among them, and they still manifest a
fondness for the dishes peculiar to Iberia, such as the "pastel", or
"pastelico", a sort of meat-pie, and the "pan de Espa√±a", or "pan de Le√≥n".
At their festivals they follow the Spanish custom of distributing "dulces", or
"dolces", a confection wrapped in paper bearing a picture of the "magen David"
(six pointed star). In Mexico, the Sephardic community originates mainly from
Turkey, Greece and Bulgaria. In 1942 the "Colegio Hebreo Tarbut" was founded in
collaboration with the Ashkenazi family and instruction was in Yiddish. In 1944
the Sephardim community established a separate "Colegio Hebreo Sefarad√≠" with
90 students where instruction was in Hebrew and complemented with classes on
Jewish customs. By 1950 there were 500 students. In 1968 a group of young
Sephardim created the group "Tnuat Noar Jinujit Dor Jadash" in support for the
creation of the state of Israel. In 1972 the "Majazike Tora" institute is
created aiming to prepare young male Jews for their Bar Mitzva (History of the
Sephardim Community in Mexico). While the majority of American Jews today are
Ashkenazim, in Colonial times Sephardim made up the majority of the Jewish
population. For example, the 1654 Jews who arrived in New Amsterdam fled from
the colony of Recife, Brazil after the Portuguese seized it from the Dutch.
Through most of the 18th century, American synagogues conducted and recorded
their business in Portuguese, even if their daily language was English. It was
not until widespread German immigration to the United States in the 19th
century that the tables turned and Ashkenazim (initially from Germany but by
the 20th century from Eastern Europe) began to dominate the American Jewish
landscape. Names. The Sephardim usually have followed the general rules for
Spanish and Portuguese names. Many used to bear Portuguese and Spanish names;
however, it is noteworthy that a large number of Sephardic names are of Hebrew
and Arabic roots and are totally absent in Iberian patronyms and are therefore
often seen as typically Jewish . Many of the names are associated with non-
Jewish (Christian) families and individuals, and are by no means exclusive to
Jews. After 1492, many marranos changed their names to hide their Jewish
origins and avoid persecution. It was common to choose the name of the Parish
Church where they have been baptised into the Christian faith, such as Santa
Cruz or the common name of the word "Messiah" (saviour/Salvador), or adopted
the name of their Christian godparents. Dr. Mark Hilton's research demonstrated
in IPS DNA testing that the last name of marranos linked with the location of
the local parish were correlated 89.3% In contrast to Ashkenazic Jews, who do
not name newborn children after living relatives, Sephardic Jews often name
their children after the children's grandparents, even if they are still alive.
The first son and daughter are traditionally named after the paternal
grandparents, and then the maternal parent's names are next up in line for the
remaining children. After that, additional children's names are "free", so to
speak, meaning that one can choose whatever name, without any more "naming
obligations." The only instance in which Sephardic Jews will not name after
their own parents is when one of the spouses shares a common first name with a
mother/father-in-law (since Jews will not name their children after
themselves.) There are times though when the "free" names are used to honor the
memory of a deceased relative who died young or childless. These conflicting
naming conventions can be troublesome when children are born into mixed
Ashkenazic-Sephardic households. A notable exception to the distinct Ashkenazi
and Sephardi naming traditions is found among Dutch Jews, where Ashkenazim have
for centuries followed the tradition otherwise attributed to Sephardim. See
Chuts. Congregations. Great authority was given to the president of each
congregation. He and the rabbinate of his congregation formed the "ma'amad,"
without whose approbation (often worded in Spanish, Portuguese, or Italian) no
book of religious content might be published. The president not only had the
power to make authoritative resolutions with regard to congregational affairs
and to decide communal questions, but he had also the right to observe the
religious conduct of the individual and to punish anyone suspected of heresy or
of trespassing against the laws. Genetics. A study by the International
Institute of Anthropology in Paris, France, confirmed similarities in the Y-
haplotype frequencies in Lebanese, Palestinian, and Sephardic Jewish men,
identifying them as "three Near-Eastern populations sharing a common geographic
origin."
