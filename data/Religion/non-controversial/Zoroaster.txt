Zoroaster Zoroaster (), also known as Zarathustra (), was the founder of
Zoroastrianism. Though he is known to most likely be Parsee/Persian, his
birthplace is uncertain, but it is now generally thought that he was born in
the eastern part of ancient Greater Iran. He is credited with the authorship of
the Yasna Haptanghaiti as well as the Gathas, hymns which are at the liturgical
core of Zoroastrianism. Most of his life is known through the Zoroastrian
texts. However, the language spoken by Zoroaster, Old Avestan, used for
composing the Yasna Haptanghaiti and the Gathas, on archaeological and
linguistic grounds, is dated to have been spoken probably in the first half of
the 2nd millennium BCE. Zoroaster was a vegetarian and strongly "forbade any
animal sacrifice" on ethical grounds. Etymology. though Zarathustra ( ) is more
commonly used. In the Middle Persian and, thus, modern Persian languages, he is
called Zardu≈°t (with variations Zar"d"osht or Zar"t"osht). --> Zoroaster's
name in his native language, Avestan, was probably "Zaraœëu≈°tra". His English
name, "Zoroaster", and the derivatives from a later (5th-century BCE) Greek
transcription, "Z≈çroastrƒìs" (), as used in Xanthus's "Lydiaca" (Fragment 32)
and in Plato's "First Alcibiades" (122a1). This form appears subsequently in
the Latin "" and, in later Greek orthographies, as "Z≈çroastris". The Greek
form of the name appears to be based on a phonetic transliteration or semantic
substitution of the Avestan "zaraœë-" with the Greek "z≈çros" (literally
"undiluted") and the Avestan "-u≈°tra" with "astron" ("star"). In Avestan,
"Zaraœëu≈°tra" is generally accepted to derive from an Old Iranian
"*Zaratu≈°tra-". While "zarat-" is strongly referenced to mean "golden" (from
the old Eastern-Iranian "zar-" [-ÿ≤ÿ±], meaning "gold") it does not itself
appear in Avestan. The second half of the name ("-u≈°tra-") is universally
accepted to mean "camel". These factors combined open the door for
reconstructing the name's meaning, though there have been other alternative
etymologies proposed. Reconstructions from later Iranian
languages‚Äîparticularly from the Middle Persian (300 BCE) "Zardusht", which is
the form that the name took in the 9th- to 12th-century Zoroastrian
texts‚Äîsuggest that "*Zaratu≈°tra-" might be a zero-grade form of
"*Zarantu≈°tra-". Subject then to whether "Zaraœëu≈°tra" derives from
"*Zarantu≈°tra-" or from "*Zaratu≈°tra-", several interpretations have been
proposed. A folk etymology of the name is from "zaraœëa", "golden", and the
"*u≈°tra", "light" (from the root "u≈°", "to shine"). In yet another
etymological variation, "Zaraœëu≈°tra" is split into two words: "zara", "gold",
and "œëu≈°tra", "friend". Several more etymologies have been proposed, some
quite fanciful, but none is factually based. The interpretation of the "-œë-"
() in Avestan "zaraœëu≈°tra" was for a time itself subjected to heated debate
because the "-œë-" is an irregular development: As a rule, "*zarat-" (a first
element that ends in a dental consonant) should have Avestan "zarat-" or
"zaratÃ∞-" as a development from it. Why this is not so for "zaraœëu≈°tra" has
not yet been determined. Notwithstanding the phonetic irregularity, that
Avestan "zaraœëu≈°tra" with its "-œë-" was linguistically an actual form is
shown by later attestations reflecting the same basis. All present-day,
Iranian-language variants of his name derive from the Middle Iranian variants
of "Zarœëo≈°t", which, in turn, all reflect Avestan's fricative "-œë-". Date.
The date of Zoroaster, i.e., the date of composition of the Old Avestan gathas,
is unknown. Classical writers such as Plutarch proposed dates prior to 6000 BC.
Dates proposed in scholarly literature diverge widely, between the 18th and the
6th centuries BC. Until the late 17th century, Zoroaster was generally dated to
about the 6th century BC, which coincided with both the "Traditional date" (see
details below) and historiographic accounts (Ammianus Marcellinus xxiii.6.32,
4th century AD). However, already at the time (late 19th century), the issue
was far from settled. The "Traditional date" originates in the period
immediately following Alexander the Great's conquest of the Achaemenid Empire
in 330 BC. The Seleucid kings who gained power following Alexander's death
instituted an "Age of Alexander" as the new calendrical epoch. This did not
appeal to the Zoroastrian priesthood who then attempted to establish an "Age of
Zoroaster." To do so, they needed to establish when Zoroaster had lived, which
they accomplished by counting back the length of successive generations until
they concluded that Zoroaster must have lived "258 years before Alexander."
This estimate then re-appeared in the 9th- to 12th-century texts of Zoroastrian
tradition, which in turn gave the date doctrinal legitimacy, especially since
it was made plausible also by the observational history of the Pleiades in the
Geoponica that indicates Zoroaster as a principal source of some observations.
In the early part of the 20th century, this remained the accepted date (subject
to the uncertainties of the 'Age of Alexander') for a number of reputable
scholars, among them Hasan Taqizadeh, a recognized authority on the various
Iranian calendars, and hence became the date cited by Henning and others. By
the late 19th century, scholars such as Bartholomea and Christensen noted
problems with the "Traditional date," namely in the linguistic difficulties
that it presented. The Old Avestan language of the Gathas (which are attributed
to the prophet himself) is still very close to the Sanskrit of the Rigveda.
Therefore, it seemed implausible that the Gathas and Rigveda could be more than
a few centuries apart, suggesting a date for the oldest surviving portions of
the Avesta of roughly the 2nd millennium BCE. A date of 11th/10th century BC
date is sometimes considered among Iranists, who in recent decades found that
the social customs described in the Gathas roughly coincide with what is known
of other pre-historical peoples of that period. Supported by this historical
evidence, the "Traditional date" can be conclusively ruled out, and the
discreditation can to some extent be supported by the texts themselves: The
Gathas describe a society of bipartite (priests and herdsmen/farmers) nomadic
pastoralists with tribal structures organized at most as small kingdoms. This
contrasts sharply with the view of Zoroaster having lived in an empire, at
which time society is attested to have had a tripartite structure (nobility/
soldiers, priests, and farmers). Although a slightly earlier date (by a century
or two) has been proposed on the grounds that the texts do not reflect the
migration onto the Iranian Plateau, it is also possible that Zoroaster lived in
one of the rural societies that remained in Central Asia. Place. "Yasna" 9 & 17
cite the Ditya River in Airyanem Vaƒìjah (Middle Persian "ƒírƒÅn Wƒìj") as
Zoroaster's home and the scene of his first appearance. The Avesta (both Old
and Younger portions) does not mention the Achaemenids or of any West Iranian
tribes such as the Medes, Persians, or even Parthians. However, in "Yasna"
59.18, the "zaraœëu≈°trotema", or supreme head of the Zoroastrian priesthood,
is said to reside in 'Ragha'. In the 9th- to 12th-century Middle Persian texts
of Zoroastrian tradition, this 'Ragha'‚Äîalong with many other places‚Äîappear
as locations in Western Iran. While the land of Media does not figure at all in
the Avesta (the westernmost location noted in scripture is Arachosia), the
"B≈´ndahi≈°n", or "Primordial Creation," (20.32 and 24.15) puts Ragha in Media
(medieval Rai). However, in Avestan, Ragha is simply a toponym meaning "plain,
hillside." Apart from these indications in Middle Persian sources which are
open to interpretations, there are a number of other sources. The Greek and
Latin sources are divided on the birthplace of Zarathustra. There are many
Greek accounts of Zarathustra, referred usually as Persian or Perso-Median
Zoroaster. Moreover they have the suggestion that there has been more than one
Zoroaster. On the other hand, in post-Islamic sources Shahrastani (1086‚Äì1153)
an Iranian writer originally from ShahristƒÅn, present-day Turkmenistan,
proposed that Zoroaster's father was from Atropatene (also in Medea) and his
mother was from Rey. Coming from a reputed scholar of religions, this was a
serious blow for the various regions who all claimed that Zoroaster originated
from "their" homelands, some of which then decided that Zoroaster must then
have then been buried in their regions or composed his Gathas there or preached
there. Also Arabic sources of the same period and the same region of historical
Persia consider Azerbaijan as the birthplace of Zarathustra. By the late 20th
century, most scholars had settled on an origin in Eastern Iran and/or
Afghanistan. Gnoli proposed Sistan (though in a much wider scope than the
present-day province) as the homeland of Zoroastrianism; Frye voted for Bactria
and Chorasmia; Khlopin suggests the Tedzen Delta in present-day Turkmenistan.
Sarianidi considered the BMAC region as "the native land of the Zoroastrians
and, probably, of Zoroaster himself." Boyce includes the steppes to the west
from the Volga. The medieval "from Media" hypothesis is no longer taken
seriously, and Zaehner has even suggested that this was a Magi-mediated issue
to garner legitimacy, but this has been likewise rejected by Gershevitch and
others. The 2005 "Encyclopedia Iranica" article on the history of
Zoroastrianism summarizes the issue with "while there is general agreement that
he did not live in western Iran, attempts to locate him in specific regions of
eastern Iran, including Central Asia, remain tentative." Life. The "Gathas"
contain allusions to personal events, such as Zoroaster's triumph over
obstacles imposed by competing priests and the ruling class. They also indicate
he had difficulty spreading his teachings, and was even treated with ill-will
in his mother's hometown. They also describe familial events such as the
marriage of his daughter, at which Zoroaster presided. In the texts of the
Younger "Avesta" (composed many centuries after the "Gathas"), Zoroaster is
depicted wrestling with the "daeva"s and is tempted by Angra Mainyu to renounce
his faith ("Yasht" 17.19; "Vendidad" 19). The "Spend Nask", the 13th section of
the Avesta, is said to have a description of the prophet's life. However, this
text has been lost over the centuries, and it survives only as a summary in the
seventh book of the 9th century "Dƒìnkard". Other 9th- to 12th-century stories
of Zoroaster, as in the "ShƒÅhnƒÅmeh", are also assumed to be based on earlier
texts, but must be considered as primarily a collection of legends. The
historical Zoroaster, however, eludes categorization as a legendary character.
Zoroaster was born into the priestly family of the "Spitamids" and his ancestor
"SpitƒÅma" is mentioned several times in the Gathas. His father's name was
"Pouru≈°aspa", or "Poroschasp," a noble Persian, and his mother's was Dughdova
("DuŒ≥Œ¥≈çuuƒÅ"). With his wife, Huvovi ("Hv≈çvi"), Zoroaster had three sons,
Isat Vastar, Uruvat-Nara and Hvare Ciœëra; three daughters, Freni, Pourucista
and Triti. His wife, children and a cousin named Maidhyoimangha, were his first
converts after his illumination from Ahura Mazda at age 30. According to
"Yasnas" 5 & 105, Zoroaster prayed to Anahita for the conversion of King
Vi≈°taspa, who appears in the "Gathas" as a historical personage. In legends,
Vi≈°taspa is said to have had two brothers as courtiers, Fra≈°a≈ç≈°tra and
Jamaspa, and to whom Zoroaster was closely related: his wife, Hv≈çvi, was the
daughter of Frasha≈ç≈°tra, while Jamaspa was the husband of his daughter
Pourucista. The actual role of intermediary was played by the pious queen
Huta≈çsa. Apart from this connection, the new prophet relied especially upon
his own kindred ("hvaƒìtu≈°"). Zoroaster's death is not mentioned in the
"Avesta". In "Shahnameh" 5.92, he is said to have been murdered at the altar by
the Turanians in the storming of Balkh. Death. Zoroaster's death was said to
have been in Balkh located in Eastern Iran during the Holy War between Turan
and Iran in 583 B.C. Jamaspa, his son-in-law, then became Zoroaster's
successor. Philosophy. In the Gathas, Zoroaster sees the human condition as the
mental struggle between "a≈°a" (truth) and "druj" (lie). The cardinal concept
of "a≈°a"‚Äîwhich is highly nuanced and only vaguely translatable‚Äîis at the
foundation of all Zoroastrian doctrine, including that of Ahura Mazda (who is
"a≈°a"), creation (that is "a≈°a"), existence (that is "a≈°a") and as the
condition for Free Will. The purpose of humankind, like that of all other
creation, is to sustain "a≈°a". For humankind, this occurs through active
participation in life and the exercise of constructive thoughts, words and
deeds. Elements of Zoroastrian philosophy entered the West through their
influence on Judaism and Middle Platonism and have been identified as one of
the key early events in the development of philosophy. Among the classic Greek
philosophers, Heraclitus is often referred to as inspired by Zoroaster's
thinking. Iconography. Although a few recent depictions of Zoroaster show the
prophet performing some deed of legend, in general the portrayals merely
present him in white vestments (which are also worn by present-day Zoroastrian
priests). He often is seen holding a "baresman" (Avestan; Middle Persian
"barsom"), which is generally considered to be another symbol of priesthood, or
with a book in hand, which may be interpreted to be the Avesta. Alternatively,
he appears with a mace, the "varza"‚Äîusually stylized as a steel rod crowned
by a bull's head‚Äîthat priests carry in their installation ceremony. In other
depictions he appears with a raised hand and thoughtfully lifted finger, as if
to make a point. Zoroaster is rarely depicted as looking directly at the
viewer; instead, he appears to be looking slightly upwards, as if beseeching.
Zoroaster is almost always depicted with a beard, this along with other factors
bearing similarities to 19th-century portraits of Jesus. A common variant of
the Zoroaster images derives from a Sassanid-era rock-face carving. In this
depiction at Taq-e Bostan, a figure is seen to preside over the coronation of
Ardashir I or II. The figure is standing on a lotus, with a "baresman" in hand
and with a gloriole around his head. Until the 1920s, this figure was commonly
supposed to be a depiction of Zoroaster, but in recent years is more commonly
interpreted to be a depiction of Mithra. Among the most famous of the European
depictions of Zoroaster is that of the figure in Raphael's 1509 The School of
Athens. In it, Zoroaster and Ptolemy are having a discussion in the lower right
corner. The prophet is holding a star-studded globe. Western perceptions. In
classical antiquity. Although, at the core, the Greeks (in the Hellenistic
sense of the term) understood Zoroaster to be the "prophet and founder of the
religion of the Iranian peoples" (e.g. Plutarch "Isis and Osiris" 46-7,
Diogenes Laertius 1.6-9 and Agathias 2.23-5), "the rest was mostly fantasy." He
was set in the impossibly ancient past, six to seven millennia before the
Common Era, and was variously a king of Bactria, or a Babylonian (or teacher of
Babylonians), and with a biography typical for every Neopythagorean sage, i.e.
a mission preceded by ascetic withdrawal and enlightenment. Most importantly
however, was their picture of Zoroaster as the sorcerer-astrologer "", and
indeed as the "inventor" of both magic and astrology. Deriving from that image,
and reinforcing it, was a "mass of literature" attributed to him and that
circulated the Mediterranean world from the 3rd century BCE to the end of
antiquity and beyond. "The Greeks considered the best wisdom to be exotic
wisdom" and "what better and more convenient authority than the
distant‚Äîtemporally and geographically‚ÄîZoroaster?" The language of that
literature was predominantly Greek, though at one stage or another various
parts of it passed through Aramaic, Syriac, Coptic or Latin. Its ethos and
cultural matrix was likewise Hellenistic, and "the ascription of literature to
sources beyond that political, cultural and temporal framework represents a bid
for authority and a fount of legitimizing "alien wisdom". Zoroaster and the
magi did not compose it, but their names sanctioned it." The attributions to
"exotic" names (not restricted to magians) conferred an "authority of a remote
and revelation wisdom." Once the magi were associated with magic in Greek
imagination, Zoroaster was bound to metamorphose into a magician too. The 1st
century Pliny the Elder names Zoroaster as the inventor of magic ("Natural
History" 30.2.3). "However, a principle of the division of labor appears to
have spared Zoroaster most of the responsibility for introducing the dark arts
to the Greek and Roman worlds." That "dubious honor" went to the "fabulous
magus, Ostanes, to whom most of the pseudepigraphic magical literature was
attributed." Although Pliny calls him the inventor of magic, the Roman does not
provide a "magician's persona" for him. Moreover, the little "magical" teaching
that is ascribed to Zoroaster is actually very late, with the very earliest
example being from the 14th century. One factor for the association with
astrology was Zoroaster's name, or rather, what the Greeks made of it. Within
the scheme of Greek thinking (which was always on the lookout for hidden
significances and "real" meanings of words) his name was identified at first
with star-worshiping ("astrothytes" "star sacrificer") and, with the "Zo-",
even as the "living" star. Later, an even more elaborate mythoetymology
evolved: Zoroaster died by the living ("zo-") flux ("-ro-") of fire from the
star ("-astr-") which he himself had invoked, and even, that the stars killed
him in revenge for having been restrained by him. Similar ideas about Zoroaster
also appear in early Christian literature, beginning with the "Clementine
Homilies" 9.4-5, which identifies him with a parallel series of traditions
about Nimrod having been the founder of astrology. In this account, Nimrod is
killed by lightning and posthumously deified by the Persians as "Zoroaster, on
account of the living ("zosan") stream of the star ("asteros") being poured
upon him." The second, and "more serious" factor for the association with
astrology was the notion that Zoroaster was a Babylonian. The alternate Greek
name for Zoroaster was Zaratas/Zaradas/Zaratos ("cf." Agathias 2.23-5, Clement
"Stromata" I.15), which‚Äîso Cumont and Bidez‚Äîderived from a Semitic form of
his name. The Pythagorean tradition considered the mathematician to have
studied with Zoroaster in Babylonia (Porphyry "Life of Pythagoras" 12,
Alexander Polyhistor apud Clement's "Stromata" I.15, Diodorus of Eritrea,
Aristoxenus apud Hippolitus VI32.2). Lydus ("On the Months" II.4) attributes
the creation of the seven-day week to "the Babylonians in the circle of
Zoroaster and Hystaspes," and who did so because there were seven planets. The
Suda's chapter on "astronomia" notes that the Babylonians learned their
astrology from Zoroaster. Lucian of Samosata ("Mennipus" 6) decides to journey
to Babylon "to ask one of the magi, Zoroaster's disciples and successors," for
their opinion. While the division along the lines of Zoroaster/astrology and
Ostanes/magic is an "oversimplification, the descriptions do at least indicate
what the works are "not"." They were not expressions of Zoroastrian doctrine,
they were not even expressions of what the Greeks and Romans ""imagined" the
doctrines of Zoroastrianism to have been." The assembled fragments do not even
show noticeable commonality of outlook and teaching among the several authors
who wrote under each name. Almost all Zoroastrian pseudepigrapha is now lost,
and of the attested texts‚Äîwith only one exception‚Äîonly fragments have
survived. Pliny's 2nd or 3rd century attribution of "two million lines" to
Zoroaster suggest that (even if exaggeration and duplicates are taken into
consideration) a formidable pseudepigraphic corpus once existed at the Library
of Alexandria. This corpus can safely be assumed to be pseudepigrapha because
no one before Pliny refers to literature by "Zoroaster," and on the authority
of the 2nd century Galen of Pergamon and from a 6th century commentator on
Aristotle it is known that the acquisition policies of well-endowed royal
libraries created a market for fabricating manuscripts of famous and ancient
authors. The exception to the fragmentary evidence (i.e. reiteration of
passages in works of other authors) is a complete Coptic tractate titled
"Zostrianos" (after the first-person narrator) discovered in the Nag Hammadi
library in 1945. A three-line cryptogram in the colophones following the 131-
page treatise identify the work as "words of truth of Zostrianos. God of Truth
["logos"]. Words of Zoroaster." Invoking a "God of Truth" might seem
Zoroastrian, but there is otherwise "nothing noticeably Zoroastrian" about the
text and "in content, style, ethos and intention, its affinities are entirely
with the congeners among the Gnostic tractates." Among the named works
attributed to "Zoroaster" is a treatise "On Nature" ("Peri physeos"), which
appears to have originally constituted four volumes (i.e. papyrus rolls). The
framework is a retelling of Plato's "Myth of Er", with Zoroaster taking the
place of the original hero. While Porphyry imagined Pythagoras listening to
Zoroaster's discourse, "On Nature" has the sun in middle position, which was
how it was understood in the 3rd century. In contrast, Plato's 4th century BCE
version had the sun in second place above the moon. Ironically, Colotes accused
Plato of plagiarizing Zoroaster, and Heraclides Ponticus wrote a text titled
"Zoroaster" based on (what the author considered) "Zoroastrian" philosophy in
order to express his disagreement with Plato on natural philosophy. With
respect to substance and content in "On Nature" only two facts are known: that
it was crammed with astrological speculations, and that Necessity ("Anank√©")
was mentioned by name and that she was in the air. Another work circulating
under the name of "Zoroaster" was the "Asteroskopita" (or "Apotelesmatika"),
and which ran to five volumes (i.e. papyrus rolls). The title and fragments
suggest that it was an astrological handbook, "albeit a very varied one, for
the making of predictions." A third text attributed to Zoroaster is "On Virtue
of Stones" ("Peri lithon timion"), of which nothing is known other than its
extent (one volume) and that pseudo-Zoroaster "sang" it (from which Cumont and
Bidez conclude that it was in verse). Numerous other fragments (preserved in
the works of other authors) are attributed to "Zoroaster," but the titles of
whose books are not mentioned. These pseudepigraphic texts aside, some authors
did draw on a few genuinely Zoroastrian ideas. The "Oracles of Hystaspes", by
"Hystaspes", another prominent magian pseudo-author, is a set of prophecies
distinguished from other Zoroastrian pseudepigrapha in that it draws on real
Zoroastrian sources. Some allusions are more difficult to assess: in the same
text that attributes the invention of magic to Zoroaster, Pliny states that
Zoroaster laughed on the day of his birth, although in an earlier place (VII,
I), Pliny had sworn in the name of Hercules that no child had ever done so
before the 40th day from his birth. This notion of Zoroaster's laughter (like
that of "two million verses") also appears in the 9th-11th century texts of
genuine Zoroastrian tradition, and for a time it was assumed that the origin of
those myths lay with indigenous sources. Pliny also records (VII, XV) that
Zoroaster's head had pulsated so strongly that it repelled the hand when laid
upon it, a presage of his future wisdom. The Iranians were however just as
familiar with the Greek writers. The provenance of other descriptions are
clear, so for instance, Plutarch's description of its dualistic theologies:
"Others call the better of these a god and his rival a daemon, as, for example,
Zoroaster the Magus, who lived, so they record, five thousand years before the
siege of Troy. He used to call the one Horomazes and the other Areimanius"
("Isis and Osiris" 46-7). In the post-classical era. Zoroaster was known as a
sage, magician, and miracle-worker in post-Classical Western culture. Although
almost nothing was known of his ideas until the late 18th century, his name was
already associated with lost ancient wisdom. However as early as 1643
statements by Sir Thomas Browne are the earliest recorded references to
Zoroaster in the English language. Zoroaster appears as "Sarastro" in Mozart's
opera "Die Zauberfl√∂te", which has been noted for its Masonic elements. He is
also the subject of the 1749 opera "Zoroastre", by Jean-Philippe Rameau.
Enlightenment writers such as Voltaire promoted research into Zoroastrianism in
the belief that it was a form of rational Deism, preferable to Christianity.
With the translation of the Avesta by Abraham Anquetil-Duperron, Western
scholarship of Zoroastrianism began. In his seminal work "Also sprach
Zarathustra (Thus Spoke Zarathustra)" (1885) the philosopher Friedrich
Nietzsche uses the native Iranian name Zarathustra which has a significant
meaning as he had used the familiar Greek-Latin name in his earlier works. It
is believed that Nietzsche invents a characterization of Zarathustra as the
mouthpiece for Nietzsche's own ideas against morality. Richard Strauss's Opus
30, inspired by Nietzsche's book, is also called "Also sprach Zarathustra".
Zoroaster was mentioned by the Irish poet William Butler Yeats. His wife and he
were said to have claimed to have contacted Zoroaster through "automatic
writing". The protagonist and narrator of Gore Vidal's 1981 novel "Creation" is
described to be the grandson of Zoroaster. Zarathustra, the mythic hero in
Giannina Braschi's 2011 dramatic novel "United States of Banana", joins forces
with Shakespeare's Hamlet to liberate Calderon de la Barca's Segismundo from
the dungeon of liberty. In other religious systems. In Islam. Citing the
authority of the 8th century al-Kalbi, the 9th/10th century historian al-Tabari
(i.648) reports that Zaradusht bin Isfiman (an Arabic adaptation of
"Zarathustra Spitama") was an inhabitant of Palestine, and a servant of one of
the disciples of the prophet Jeremiah. According to this tale, Zaradusht
defrauded his master, who cursed him, causing him to become leprous (cf.
Elisha's servant Gehazi in Jewish Scripture). The apostate Zaradusht then
eventually made his way to Balkh where he converted Bishtasb (i.e. Vishtaspa),
who in turn compelled his subjects to adopt the religion of the Magians.
Recalling other tradition, al-Tabari (i.681-683) recounts that Zaradusht
accompanied a Jewish prophet to Bishtasb/Vishtaspa. Upon their arrival,
Zaradusht translated the sage's Hebrew teachings for the king and so convinced
him to convert (Tabari also notes that they had previously been "Sabi"s) to the
Magian religion. The 10th/11th century heresiographer al-Shahrastani describes
the Majusiya into three sects, the "Kayumarthiya", the "Zurwaniya" and the
"Zaradushtiya", among which Al-Shahrastani asserts that only the last of the
three were properly followers of Zoroaster. As regards the recognition of a
prophet, the Zoroaster has said: "They ask you as to how should they recognize
a prophet and believe him to be true in what he says; tell them what he knows
the others do not, and he shall tell you even what lies hidden in your nature;
he shall be able to tell you whatever you ask him and he shall perform such
things which others cannot perform." (Namah Shat Vakhshur Zartust, .5-7.
50‚Äì54) Shortly before the advent of the prophet of Islam, , Persia was under
the sovereignty of Sasan V. When the companions of the Prophet, on invading
Persia, came in contact with the Zoroastrian people and learned these
teachings, they at once came to the conclusion that Zoroaster was really a
Divinely inspired prophet. Thus they accorded the same treatment to the
Zoroastrian people which they did to other "People of the Book." Though the
name of Zoroaster is not mentioned in the Qur'an, still he was regarded as one
of those prophets whose names have not been mentioned in the Qur'an, for there
is a verse in the Qur'an: "And We did send apostles before thee: there are some
of them that We have mentioned to thee and there are others whom We have not
mentioned to Thee." (40 : 78). Accordingly the Muslims treated the founder of
Zoroastrianism as a true prophet and believed in his religion as they did in
other inspired creeds, and thus according to the prophecy, protected the
Zoroastrian religion. James Darmestar has truly remarked in the translation of
Zend Avesta: "When Islam assimilated the Zoroastrians to the People of the
Book, it evinced a rare historical sense and solved the problem of the origin
of the Avesta." (Introduction to Vendiad. p.¬ 69.) Ahmadiyya view. Ahmadi
Muslims view Zoroaster as a Prophet of God and describe the expressions of
Ahura Mazda, the God of goodness and Ahraman, the God of evil as merely
referring to the coexistence of forces of good and evil enabling humans to
exercise free will. Mirza Tahir Ahmad, the fourth Caliph of the Ahmadiyya
Muslim Community, in his book "Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge & Truth"
views Zoroaster as Prophet of God and describes such the expressions to be a
concept which is similar to the concepts in Judaism, Christianity and Islam. In
Manichaeism. Manichaeism considered Zoroaster to be a figure (along with Jesus
and the Buddha) in a line of prophets of which Mani (216‚Äì276) was the
culmination. Zoroaster's ethical dualism is‚Äîto an extent‚Äîincorporated in
Mani's doctrine, which viewed the world as being locked in an epic battle
between opposing forces of good and evil. Manicheanism also incorporated other
elements of Zoroastrian tradition, particularly the names of supernatural
beings; however, many of these other Zoroastrian elements are either not part
of Zoroaster's own teachings or are used quite differently from how they are
used in Zoroastrianism. In the Bah√°'√≠ Faith. Zoroaster appears in the
Bah√°'√≠ Faith as a "Manifestation of God", one of a line of prophets who have
progressively revealed the Word of God to a gradually maturing humanity.
Zoroaster thus shares an exalted station with Abraham, Moses, Jesus, Muhammad,
the B√°b, and the founder of the Bah√°'√≠ Faith, Bah√°'u'll√°h. Shoghi Effendi,
the Guardian of the Bah√°'√≠ Faith, saw Bah√°'u'll√°h as the fulfillment of a
