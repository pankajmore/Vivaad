Anti-Arabism Anti-Arabism or Arabophobia is consistent advocacy of
discrimination, extermination, prejudice, hostility, hatred, or genocide toward
Arabs. Arab definition. Arabs are people whose native language is Arabic.
People of Arabic origin, in particular native English and French speakers of
Arab ancestry in Europe and the Americas, often identify themselves as Arabs.
Anti-Arabism is commonly confused with Islamophobia. There are prominent Arab
non-Muslim minorities in the Arab world. These minorities include Arabic-
speaking Christians in Egypt, Lebanon, the Palestinian territories, Israel,
Syria, Jordan, Kuwait and Iraq, among other Arab countries. There are also
sizable minorities of Arab Jews and Druze. Historical anti-Arabism. Anti-Arab
prejudice has been found throughout the Western world, notably in Europe and
the Americas, for centuries. In the Iberian Peninsula, all non-Catholics,
including Muslim Arabs, were targeted following the 15th century fall of
Granada, the last Amazigh(Berber)state in Al-Andalus. In 1492, Arab converts to
Christianity, called Moriscos, were expelled from Spain to North Africa after
being condemned by the Spanish Inquisition. The Spanish word "moro", meaning
"moor", today carries a negative meaning. Although ethnically different than
the Arabs in Spain at the time, the term Moro was also used pejoratively by the
Spanish since the 16th century to refer to Muslim tribal groups in the
Philippines; the term "indios" was used to refer to Christianized tribal
groups. After the annexation of the Muslim-ruled state of Hyderabad by India in
1948, about 7,000 Arabs were interned and deported. The Zanzibar Revolution of
January 12, 1964, ended the local Arab dynasty. As many as 17,000 Arabs were
exterminated by the descendants of black African slaves, according to reports,
and thousands of others were detained and their property either confiscated or
destroyed. In "The Arabic Language and National Identity: a Study in Ideology",
Yasir Suleiman notes of the writing of Tawfiq al-Fikayki that he uses the term
"shu'ubiyya" to refer to movements he perceives to be anti-Arab, such as the
Turkification movement in the Ottoman Empire, extreme-nationalist and Pan-
Iranist movements in Iran and communism. In al-Fikayki's view, the objectives
of anti-Arabism are to attack Arab nationalism, pervert history, emphasize Arab
regression, deny Arab culture, and generally be hostile to all things Arab. He
concludes that, "In all its various roles, anti-Arabism has adopted a policy of
intellectual conquest as a means of penetrating Arab society and combatting
Arab nationalism." Modern anti-Arabism. Algeria. Anti-Arabism is a major
element of movements known as Berberism that are widespread mainly amongst
Algerians of Kabyle and other Berber origin. It has historic roots as Arabs are
seen as invaders that occupied Algeria and destroyed its late Roman and early
medieval civilization that was considered an integral part of the West; this
invasion is considered to have been the source of the resettlement of Algeria's
Berber population in Kabylie and other mountainuous areas. Regardless, the
Kabyles and other Berbers have managed to preserve their culture and achieve
higher standards of living and education when compared to Algerian Arabs.
Furthermore, many Berbers speak their language and French; are non religious,
secular, or Evangelical Christian; and openly identify with the Western World.
Many Berber Nationalists view Arabs as a hostile people intent on eradicating
their own culture and nation. Berber social norms restrict marriage to someone
of Arab ethnicity, although it is permitted to marry someone from other ethnic
groups. According to Lawrence Rosen, ethnic background is not a crucial factor
in marriage between members of each group in North Africa, when compared to
social and economic backgrounds. There are regular Hate incidents between Arabs
and Berbers and Anti-Arabism has been accentuated by the Algerian governments
anti-Berber policies and violent actions as well as by Islamist (Arab) terror
acts against Berbers. Contemporary relations between Berbers and Arabs are
sometimes tense, particularly in Algeria, where Berbers rebelled (1963‚Äì65,
2001) against Arab rule and have demonstrated and rioted against their cultural
marginalization in the new founded state. The Anti-Arab sentiments among
Algerian Berbers (mainly from Kabylie) were always related to the reassertion
of Kabyle identity. It began as an intellectual militant movement in schools,
universities, and popular culture (mainly nationalistic songs). In addition to
that, the authorities‚Äô efforts to promote development in Kabylie contributed
to a boom of sorts in Tizi Ouzou, whose population almost doubled between 1966
and 1977, and to a greater degree of economic and social integration within the
region had the contrary effect of strengthening a collective Amazigh
consciousness and Anti-Arab sentiments. Arabophobia can be seen at different
levels of intellectual, social, and cultural life of some Berbers. After the
Berberist crisis in 1949, a new radical intellectual movement emerged under the
name "L'Acad√©mie Berb√®re". This movement was known by its adoption and
promotion of Anti-Arab and Anti-Islam ideologies especially amongst immigrant
Kabyles in France and achieved a relative success at the time. In 1977, the
final game of the national soccer championship pitting a team from Kabylie
against one from Algiers turned into an Arab-Berber conflict. The Arab national
anthem of Algeria was overwhelmed by the shouting of Anti-Arab slogans such as
"A bas les arabes" ("down with the Arabs"). The roots of modern day Arabophobia
in Algeria can be traced back to multiple factors. For some, Anti-Arabism
movement among Berbers is part of the legacy of French Colonization or
manipulation of North Africa. As from the beginning, the French understood that
to attenuate Muslim resistance to their presence, mainly in Algeria, they had
to resort to the divide and rule doctrine. The most obvious divide that could
be instrumentalized in this perspective was the ethnic one. Therefore, France
employed some official colonial practices to tighten its control over Algeria
by creating racial tensions between Arabs and Berbers and between Jews and
Muslims. Others argue that the Berber language and traditions are deeply rooted
in the North African cultural mosaic; for centuries, Berber culture has
survived conquests, repression, and exclusion from different invaders: Romans,
Arabs, and French. Hence, believing that its identity and specificity were
threatened, the Berbers took note of the political and ideological implications
of Arabism as defended by successive governments. Gradual radicalization and
Anti-Arab sentiments began to emerge in Algeria and among the hundreds of
thousands of Berbers in France who had been in the forefront of the Berber
cultural movement. Australia. The Cronulla riots in Sydney, Australia in
December 2005 have been described as "anti-Arab racism" by community leaders.
NSW Premier Morris Iemma said the violence revealed the "ugly face of racism in
this country". A 2004 report by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity
Commission said that more than two-thirds of Muslim and Arab Australians say
they have experienced racism or racial vilification since the September 11
attacks and that 90% of female respondents experienced racial abuse or
violence. Adam Houda, a Lebanese Muslim lawyer, has been repeatedly harassed by
the New South Wales police force. Houda has been arrested or detained 11 times
in six years and has sued the police force for malicious prosecution and
harassment three times. Houda claims that the police's motivation is racism
which he says is "alive and well" in Bankstown. He has been stopped going to
prayers, with relatives and friends and has been subjected to a humiliating
body search. He is often accused of robbery or holding a knife although Houda
has no criminal history whatsoever. A senior lawyer told the Sydney Morning
Herald that the police harassment was due to the police enmity against Houda's
clients and the Australian Arab community. He was first falsely arrested in
2000 for which he was awarded $145,000 damages by a judge who described his
persecution as "shocking." Constable Lance Stebbing was found to have
maliciously arrested Houda, as well as using profanities against him and
approaching him in a "menacing manner". Stebbing was supported by other police,
against the testimony of many eyewitnesses. In 2005, Houda accused the police
of disabling his mobile phone making it difficult to perform his work as a
criminal lawyer. In 2010 Houda, his lawyer Chris Murphy, and Channel Seven
journalist Adam Walters claimed that Frank Menilli, a senior New South Wales
police officer, behaved in a corrupt fashion by trying to alter Channel Seven's
coverage of the Houda Case by promising the Walter's inside information in
exchange for presenting the case in the police's favour. Walters' regarded the
offer as an "attempted bribe". The latest incident occurred in 2011, when Houda
was arrested for refusing a frisk search and resisting arrest after having been
approached by police suspecting him of involvement in a recent robbery. These
charges were thrown out of court by Judge John Connell who stated "At the end
of the day, here were three men of Middle Eastern appearance walking along a
suburban street, for all the police knew, minding their own business at an
unexceptional time of day, in unexceptional clothing, except two of the men had
hooded jumpers. The place they were in could not have raised a reasonable
suspicion they were involved in the robberies" Houda is currently suing the six
police officers involved for false imprisonment, unlawful arrest, assault and
battery and defamation. One of the six is an assistant commissioner. He is
seeking $5 million in damages. Czech Republic. In September 2008, Muslims
complained about anti-Arabism and Islamophobia in the Czech Republic. France.
France used to be a colonial empire, with still great post-colonial power over
its former colonies, using Africa as a reservoir for labor, especially in
moments of dire need. During World War I, reconstruction and shortages made
France bring thousands of North African workers. Out of a total of 116,000
workers from 1914‚Äì1918, 78,000 Algerians, 54,000 Moroccans, and Tunisians
were requistioned. Two hundred and forty thousand Algerians were mobilized or
drafted, and two thirds of these were soldiers who served mostly in France.
This constituted more than one-third of the men of those nations from ages
20‚Äì40. According to historian Abdallah Laroui, Algeria sent 173,000 soldiers,
25,000 of whom were killed. Tunisia sent 56,000, of whom 12,000 were killed.
Moroccan soldiers helped defend Paris and landed at Bordeaux in 1916. After the
war, reconstruction and labor shortages necessitated even larger number of
Algerian laborers. Migration (or the need for labor) was reestablished at a
high level by 1936. This was partly the result of collective recruitments in
the villages conducted by French officers and representatives of companies.
Labor recruitment continued throughout the 1940s. North Africans were mostly
recruited for dangerous and low-wage jobs, unwanted by ordinary French workers.
This large number of immigrants was of great help for France's rapid
post‚ÄìWorld War II economic growth. The 1970s were marked by recession
followed by the cessation of labor migration programs and crackdowns on illegal
immigration. During the 1980s, political disfavor with President Mitterrand's
social programs led to the rise of Jean-Marie Le Pen and other far right French
nationalists. The public increasingly blamed immigrants for French economic
problems. In March 1990, according to a poll reported in Le Monde, 76% of those
polled said that there were too many Arabs in France while 39% said they had an
"aversion" to Arabs. In the following years, Interior Minister Charles Pasqua
was noted for dramatically toughening immigration laws. In May 2005, riots
broke out between North Africans and Romani people in Perpignan, after a young
Arab man was shot dead and another Arab man was lynched by a group of Roma.
Chirac's controversial "Hijab ban" law, presented as secularization of schools,
was interpreted by its critics as an "indirect legitimization of anti-Arab
stereotypes, fostering rather than preventing racism." Iran. The constitution
of the Islamic Republic of Iran provides for the teaching of non-Persian
languages and non-Persian media and equal rights, without privileging any race,
color, or linguistic group ("see: Current policy towards ethnic minorities in
Iran"). Arabs are therefore granted legal equality with other Iranian ethnic
groups. However, human rights group Amnesty International claims that in
practice, Arabs are among a number of ethnic minorities that are disadvantaged
and suffer discrimination by the authorities. Separatist tendencies in
Khuzestan exacerbate this. How far the situation facing Arabs in Iran is
related to racism or simply a result of policies suffered by all Iranians is a
matter of debate ("see: Politics of Khuzestan"). Iran is a multi-ethnic society
with its Arab minority mainly located in the south. It is claimed by some, that
anti-Arabism in Iran may be related to the notion that Arabs forced some
Persians to convert to Islam in 7th century AD ("See: Muslim conquest of
Persia"). Author Richard Foltz in his article "Internationalization of Islam"
states "Even today, many Iranians perceive the Arab destruction of the Sassanid
Empire as the single greatest tragedy in Iran's long history. ("See also: Anti-
Persian sentiments") Following the Muslim conquest of Persia, many Iranians
(also known as "mawali") came to despise the Umayyads due to discrimination
against them by their Arab rulers. The Shu'ubiyah movement was intended to
reassert Iranian identity and resist attempts to impose Arab culture while
reaffirming their commitment to Islam. More recently, anti-Arabism has arisen
as a consequence of aggression against Iran by the regime of Saddam Hussein in
Iraq. During a visit to Khuzestan, which has most of Iran's Arab population, a
British journalist, John R. Bradley, wrote that despite the fact that the
majority of Arabs supported Iran in the war, "ethnic Arabs complain that, as a
result of their divided loyalties during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, they are viewed
more than ever by the clerical regime in Tehran as a potential fifth column,
and suffer from a policy of discrimination." However, Iran's Arab population
played an important role in defending Iran during the Iran-Iraq War and most
refused to heed Saddam Hussein's call for an uprising and instead fought
against their fellow Arabs. Furthermore, Iran's former defense minister Ali
Shamkhani, an Ahwazi Arab, was chief commander of the ground force during the
Iran-Iraq War as well as serving as first deputy commander of the Islamic
Revolutionary Guard Corps. The Ahwazi Arab minority has been subject to
discriminations, persecution in Iran. In a report published in February 2006,
Amnesty International claimed that the "Arab population of Iran is one of the
most economically and socially deprived in Iran" and that Arabs have
"reportedly been denied state employment under the "gozinesh" placement
criteria." Furthermore, it states Critics of such reports have pointed out that
they are often based on sketchy sources and are not always to be trusted at
face value (see: Criticism of human rights reports on Khuzestan). Furthermore,
critics point out that Arabs have social mobility in Iran, with a number of
famous Iranians from the worlds of arts, sport, literature, and politics having
Arab origins (see: Famous Iranian Arabs) illustrating Arab-Iranian
participation in Iranian economics, society, and politics. They contend that
Khuzestan province, where most of Iran's Arabs live, is actually one of the
more economically advanced provinces of Iran, more so than many of the Persian-
populated provinces. Some critics of the Iranian government contend that it is
carrying out a policy of anti-Arab ethnic cleansing. While there has been large
amounts of investment in industrial projects such as the "Razi Petrochemical
Complex", local universities, and other national projects such as hydroelectric
dams (such as the Karkeh Dam, which cost $700 million to construct) and nuclear
power plants, many critics of Iran's economic development policies have pointed
to the poverty suffered by Arabs in Khuzestan as proof of an anti-Arab policy
agenda. Following his visit to Khuzestan in July 2005, UN Special Rapporteur
for Adequate Housing Miloon Kothari spoke of how up to 250,000 Arabs had been
displaced by such industrial projects and noted the favorable treatment given
to settlers from Yazd compared to the treatment of local Arabs. However, it is
also true that non-Arab provinces such as Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad Province,
Sistan and Baluchestan Province, and neighboring ƒ™lƒÅm Province also suffer
high levels of poverty, indicating that government policy is not disadvantaging
Arabs alone but other regions, including some with large ethnically Persian
populations. Furthermore, most commentators agree that Iran's state-controlled
and highly subsidized economy is the main reason behind the inability of the
Iranian government to generate economic growth and welfare at ground levels in
all cities across the nation, rather than a state ethnic policy targeted
specifically at Arabs; Iran is ranked 156th on The Heritage Foundation's 2006
Index of Economic Freedom. In the Iranian education system, after primary
education cycle (grades 1-5 for children 6 to 11 years old), passing some
Arabic courses is mandatory until the end of secondary education cycle (grade 6
to Grade 12, from age 11 to 17). In higher education systems (universities),
passing Arabic language courses is selective. Israel. "See also: Arab citizens
of Israel, Racism in Israel, and International law and Israeli settlements"
During the Arab riots in October 2000 events, Israelis counter-rioted in
Nazareth and Tel Aviv, throwing stones at Arabs, destroying Arab property, and
chanting "death to Arabs". The Israeli political party Yisrael Beiteinu, whose
platform includes the redrawing of Israel's borders so that 500,000 Israeli
Arabs would be part of a future Palestinian State, won 15 seats in the 2009
Israeli elections, increasing its seats by 4 compared to the 2006 Israeli
elections. This policy, also known as the Lieberman Plan, was described as
"anti-Arab" by "The Guardian". Avigdor Lieberman, leader of Yisrael Beiteinu,
was appointed Minister of Strategic Threats by Ehud Olmert. Arab MK Ahmad Tibi
described Lieberman as "a very dangerous and sophisticated politician who has
won his support through race hatred". Yehuda Ben Meir, in an opinion column in
"Haaretz", argued against the labeling of Lieberman as a racist. In 2004,
Yehiel Hazan, a member of the Knesset, described the Arabs as worms: "You find
them everywhere like worms, underground as well as above." Rafael Eitan, former
Chief of Staff of the Israel Defense Forces, said that Palestinians who
endanger cars on the road should be treated aggressively and their freedom of
movement narrowed until they will be like "drugged cockroaches in a bottle". In
2004, then Deputy Defense Minister Ze'ev Boim asked "What is it about Islam as
a whole and the Palestinians in particular? Is it some form of cultural
deprivation? Is it some genetic defect? There is something that defies
explanation in this continued murderousness." In Hebron, the slogans "Arabs to
the crematoria" and "Arabs - " were once spray-painted on a wall by an unknown,
and anti-Arab graffiti has been spray-painted in Jerusalem. Leftists noted that
this graffiti remains for long periods of time compared to others, and painted
swastikas beside the graffiti in order to hasten the city to take action. In
the 1980s and 1990s "Geography books for the elementary and junior high schools
stereotype Arabs negatively, as primitive, dirty, agitated, aggressive, and
hostile to Jews ... history books in the elementary schools hardly mention
Arabs ... history textbooks of the high schools, the majority of which cover
the Arab-Jewish conflict, stereotype the Arabs negatively. Arabs are presented
as intransigent and uncompromising." The Bedouin submitted a report to the
United Nations that disputes the Israeli Government's official state report
claiming that they are not treated as equal citizens and Bedouin towns are not
provided the same level of services, land and water as Jewish towns of the same
size are. The city of Beersheba refused to recognize a Bedouin holy site
despite a High Court recommendation. Israeli Arabs said they would draw up a
list of grievances after the terrorist attack of Eden Natan-Zada. "This was a
planned terror attack and we find it extremely difficult to treat it as an
individual action," Abed Inbitawi, an Israeli-Arab spokesman, told "The
Jerusalem Post". "It marks a certain trend that reflects a growing tendency of
fascism and racism in Israeli society generally as well as the establishment
towards the minority Arab community," he said. Often Israeli-Arab soccer
players face chants from the crowd when they play such as "no Arabs, no
terrorism". Abbas Zakour, an Arab Member of the Knesset, was stabbed and
lightly wounded by Russian immigrants who shouted anti-Arab chants. The attack
was described as a "hate crime". In 2006, a research institute poll reported
that 41% of Israelis support Arab-Israeli segregation, 40% believed "the state
needs to support the emigration of Arab citizens", and 63% believed Arabs to be
a "security and demographic threat" to Israel. the poll found that more than
two thirds would not want to live in the same building as an Arab, 36% believed
Arab culture to be inferior, and 18% felt hatred when they heard Arabic spoken.
In 2007, the Association for Civil Rights in Israel reported that anti-Arab
views had doubled, and anti-Arab racist incidents had increased by 26%. The
report quoted polls that suggested 50% of Jewish Israelis do not believe Arab
citizens of Israel should have equal rights, 50% said they wanted the
government to encourage Arab emigration from Israel, and 75% of Jewish youths
said Arabs were less intelligent and less clean than Jews. The Mossawa Advocacy
Center for Arab Citizens in Israel reported a tenfold increase in racist
incidents against Arabs in 2008. Jerusalem reported the highest number of
incidents. The report blamed Israeli leaders for the violence, saying "These
attacks are not the hand of fate, but a direct result of incitement against the
Arab citizens of this country by religious, public, and elected officials." In
March 2009, following the Gaza War, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) drew
criticism when several young soldiers had T-shirts printed up privately with
slogans and caricatures that were deemed offensive to Palestinians. In March
2009, a series of Arab cultural events titled "Jerusalem, the capital of Arab
culture", which were scheduled to be held in Jerusalem, Nazareth, and other
parts of the country, was banned by Avi Dichter the Internal Security Minister
of Israel. Nazareth Mayor Ramiz Jeraisi criticized the move as "anti-Arab."
According to Dichter, the events were a violation of the interim agreement
between Israel and the Palestinians. In June 2009, Haaretz reported on the
phenomenon of Israeli Border Police forcing Palestinians to humiliate
themselves on camera and then publishing the video on YouTube. Palestinians
were made to sing songs with lyrics such as "Let every Arab mother know that
the fate of her children is in the hands of the Company". In June 2009, Haaretz
reported that Israel's Public Security Minister, Yitzhak Aharonovich, called an
undercover police officer a "dirty Arab" whilst touring Tel Aviv. In March
2012, two Arab males of Beit Zarzir confessed, after being arrested, to
damaging a local school for Arab and Jewish students. They admitted
responsibility for having sprayed on the wall of the school, "Death to
Arabs".The school was sprayed twice in February with the slogans ‚Äúprice
tag,‚Äù ‚ÄúDeath to Arabs, and‚Äù ‚ÄúHolocaust to the Arabs‚Äù. Israel was
established as a Jewish state, and the state was also intended to provide full
equality to non-Jewish citizens. It is defined in its Basic Laws as a "Jewish
and democratic state". The Israeli Declaration of Independence declares Israel
to be a Jewish state, but stipulates that the State of Israel would ensure
complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants
irrespective of religion, race or sex, and guaranteed freedom of religion,
conscience, language, education and culture. While formally equal according to
Israeli law, Irish writer and politician Conor Cruise O'Brien claims that anti-
Arabism is widespread in Israel. Mixed Arab-Jewish couples. Many Israeli Jews
oppose mixed relationships, particularly between Jewish women and Arab men. A
2007 opinion poll found that more than half of Israeli Jews believed
intermarriage is equivalent to "national treason". A group of men in Pisgat
Ze'ev started patrolling the neighborhood to stop Jewish women from dating Arab
men. The municipality of Petah Tikva has a telephone hotline to inform on
Jewish girls who date Arab men, as well as a psychological counseling service.
Kiryat Gat launched a school programme to warn Jewish girls against dating
local Bedouin men. Niger. In October 2006, the government of Niger announced
that it would deport the Arabs living in the Diffa region of eastern Niger to
Chad. This population numbered about 150,000. While the government was rounding
Arabs in preparation for the deportation, two girls died, reportedly after
fleeing government forces, and three women suffered miscarriages. Niger's
government had eventually suspended the controversial decision to deport Arabs.
United Kingdom. In 2008, a Qatari 16-year-old was killed by a racist mob in
Hastings, East Sussex. United States. William A. Dorman, writing in the
compedium "The United States and the Middle East: A Search for New
Perspectives" (1992) notes that whereas "anti-Semitism is no longer socially
acceptable, at least among the educated classes. No such social sanctions exist
for anti-Arabism." In the mid-1970s, prominent American Objectivist author,
scholar and philosopher Ayn Rand, expressed strong anti-Arab sentiment
following the Arab-Israeli War of 1973: "The Arabs are one of the least
developed cultures. They are typically nomads. Their culture is primitive, and
they resent Israel because it's the sole beachhead of modern science and
civilization on their continent. When you have civilized men fighting savages,
you support the civilized men, no matter who they are." During the 1991 Gulf
War, hostility toward Arabs increased in the United States. Arab Americans have
experienced a backlash as result of terrorist attacks, including events where
Arabs were not involved, like the Oklahoma City bombing, and the explosion of
TWA Flight 800. According to a report prepared by the Arab American Institute,
three days after the Oklahoma City bombing "more than 200 serious hate crimes
were committed against Arab Americans and American Muslims. The same was true
in the days following September 11." According to a 2001 poll of Arab Americans
conducted by the Arab American Institute, 32% of Arab Americans reported having
been subjected to some form of ethnic-based discrimination during their
lifetimes, while 20% reported having experienced an instance of ethnic-based
discrimination since September 11. Of special concern, for example, is the fact
that 45% of students and 37% of Arab Americans of the Muslim faith report being
targeted by discrimination since September 11. According to the FBI and Arab
groups, the number of attacks against Arabs and Muslims, as well as others
mistaken for them, rose considerably after the 9/11 attacks. Hate crimes
against people of Middle Eastern origin or descent increased from 354 attacks
in 2000, to 1,501 attacks in 2001. Among the victims of the backlash was a
Middle Eastern man in Houston, Texas who was shot and wounded after an
assailant accused him of "blowing up the country", and four immigrants shot and
killed by a man named Larme Price, who confessed to killing them as revenge for
the September 11 attacks. Although Price described his victims as Arabs, only
one was from an Arab country. This appears to be a trend; because of
stereotypes of Arabs, several non-Arab, non-Muslim groups were subjected to
attacks in the wake of 9/11, including several Sikh men attacked for wearing
their religiously-mandated turban. Earl Krugel and Irv Rubin, two leaders of
the Jewish Defense League (JDL), described by the U.S. Department of Homeland
Security as a terrorist organization, planned to bomb Arab-American Congressman
Darrell Issa's office and the King Fahd Mosque in Culver City, California. The
two were arrested as part of a sting operation when they received a shipment of
explosives at Krugel's home in Los Angeles. Krugel was murdered in November
2005 while in the custody of the Federal Bureau of Prisons in Phoenix. His
conviction, which was under appeal at that time, was dismissed in U.S. District
Court. Rubin committed suicide in 2002 while in Federal Bureau of Prisons
custody in Los Angeles. Although the JDL was suspected in the 1985 bombing
death of ADC leader Alex Odeh, no arrest has been made in that case. Stephen E.
Herbits, the Secretary-General of the New York‚Äìbased World Jewish Congress
(WJC) made several racist remarks and ethnic slurs in an internal memo against
the president of the European Jewish Congress Pierre Besnainou: "He is French.
Don‚Äôt discount this. He cannot be trusted ... He is Tunisian. Do not discount
this either. He works like an Arab." The WJC in Israel has condemned the
statements as both hateful and racist. "It appears that the struggle in the
World Jewish Congress has now turned racist, said Knesset member Shai Hermesh
(Kadima), who heads the Israeli board of the WJC. Instead of creating unity
among the Jewish people, this organization is just creating division and
hatred." Conservative pundit and author Michelle Malkin has accused the
American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee of exaggeration and questioned the
existence of a post‚ÄìSeptember 11 anti-Arab hate-crime epidemic. She says that
the "hype artists" and "book-cookers" of ADC reported that "a Muslim student
was pelted with eggs at Arizona State University", but that of two such
incidents logged at the university, one was a "complete hoax", and the other
was not considered a hate crime by police. In 2004, American radio host Michael
Savage described Arabs as "non-humans", said that Americans want the U.S. to
"drop a nuclear weapon" on an Arab country; and advocated that people in the
Middle East be "forcibly converted to Christianity" to "turn them into human
beings". Savage characterized Israel as "A little country surrounded by racist,
fascist bigots who don't want anyone but themselves living in that hell hole
called the Middle East". Expressions of anti-Arabism in the United States
intensified following the November 5, 2009, Fort Hood shooting. In 2010, the
proposed development of an Islamic center containing a mosque near the World
Trade Center site provoked further widespread expressions of virulent anti-
Arabism in the United States Western media. Parts of Hollywood are regarded as
using a disproportionate number of Arabs as villains and of depicting Arabs
negatively and stereotypically. According to Godfrey Cheshire, a critic on the
"New York Press", "the only vicious racial stereotype that's not only still
permitted but actively endorsed by Hollywood" is that of Arabs as crazed
terrorists. Like the image projected of Jews in Nazi Germany, the image of
Arabs projected by western movies is often that of "money-grubbing caricatures
that sought world domination, worshipped a different God, killed innocents, and
lusted after blond virgins." The 2000 film "Rules of Engagement" drew criticism
from Arab groups and was described as "probably the most racist film ever made
against Arabs by Hollywood" by the ADC. Paul Clinton of "The Boston Globe"
wrote "at its worst, it's blatantly racist, using Arabs as cartoon-cutout bad
guys". Jack Shaheen, in his book "Reel Bad Arabs", surveyed more than 900 film
appearances of Arab characters. Of those, only a dozen were positive and 50
were balanced. Shaheen writes that "stereotypes are deeply ingrained in
American cinema. From 1896 until today, filmmakers have collectively indicted
all Arabs as Public Enemy #1 ‚Äì brutal, heartless, uncivilized religious
fanatics and money-mad cultural "others" bent on terrorizing civilized
Westerners, especially [Christians and Much has happened since 1896¬ ...
Throughout it all, Hollywood's caricature of the [Arab has prowled the silver
screen. He is there to this day ‚Äì repulsive and unrepresentative as ever."
According to "Newsweek" columnist Meg Greenfield, anti-Arab sentiment presently
promotes misconceptions about Arabs and hinders genuine peace in the Middle
East. In 1993, the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee confronted
Disney about anti-Arab racist content in its animated film Aladdin. At first
Disney denied any problems but eventually relented and changed two lines in the
opening song. Members of the ADC were still unhappy with the portrayal of
Arabic characters and the referral to the Middle East as "barbaric". In 1980,
"The Link", a magazine published by Americans for Middle East Understanding,
contained an article "The Arab Stereotype on Television" which detailed
negative Arab stereotypes that appeared in TV shows including "Woody
Woodpecker", "Rocky and Bullwinkle", "Jonny Quest" and an educational
children's show on PBS. Groups that advocate for Arabs. United States. The
American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) was founded in 1980 by United
States Senator James Abourezk. It describes itself as the largest Arab-American

discrimination and bias against Arab Americans. The Council on American-Islamic
Relations (CAIR) is an Islamic organization in North America that was created
in June 1994. It has been active against anti-Arabism as well. The Anti-
Defamation League (ADL), which was founded to combat antisemitism and other
forms of bigotry, actively investigated and spoke out against the rise in anti-
Arab hate crimes following the September 2001 terrorist attacks. In 2003, the
ADL urged the Speaker of the United States' House of Representatives to approve
a resolution condemning bigotry and violence against Arab-Americans and
American Muslims. The American Jewish Committee, and American Jewish Congress
have issued similar responses. In 2004, the ADL national director issued the
following statement: "we are disturbed that a number of Arab Americans and
Islamic institutions have been targets of anger and hatred in the aftermath of
the terrorist attacks." In the 1990s, the Anti-Defamation League clashed with
the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee in a legal dispute regarding
sensitive information the ADL had collected about ADC members' positions on the
Arab-Israeli conflict. In 1999, the dispute was finally settled out of court
without any finding of wrongdoing. In 2001 the ADL attempted to bar Arab
members of CAIR from attending a conference on multicultural inclusion. In 2007
the ADL accused the Council on American-Islamic Relations of having a "poor
record on terrorism." CAIR, in turn, accused the ADL of "attempting to muzzle
the First Amendment rights of American Muslims by smearing and demonizing
them". When the case was settled, Hussein Ibish, director of communications for
the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC), stated that the ADL had
gathered data "systematically in a program whose clear intent was to undermine
civil rights and Arab-American organizations". United Kingdom. In Britain, the

Association of British Arabs also works against discrimination. United Nations.
