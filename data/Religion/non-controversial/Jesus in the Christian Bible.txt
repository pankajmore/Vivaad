Life of Jesus in the New Testament The four canonical gospels of the New
Testament are the primary sources of information for the narrative of the life
of Jesus. However, other parts of the New Testament, such as the Pauline
epistles which were likely written decades before them, also include references
to key episodes in his life such as the Last Supper. And the Acts of the
Apostles () says more about the Ascension episode than the canonical gospels.
The genealogy and Nativity of Jesus are described in two of the four canonical
gospels: Matthew and Luke. Luke and Matthew describe Jesus being born in
Bethlehem, in Judea, to a virgin mother. In Matthew, wise men follow a star to
Bethlehem to bring gifts to Jesus, born the "King of the Jews". King Herod
massacres all the toddler boys in Bethlehem to kill Jesus, but the holy family
flees to Egypt and later settles in Nazareth. In the gospels, the ministry of
Jesus starts with his Baptism by John the Baptist, when he is about thirty
years old. Jesus then begins preaching in Galilee and gathers disciples. After
the proclamation of Jesus as Christ, three of the disciples witness his
Transfiguration. After the death of John the Baptist and the Transfiguration,
Jesus starts his final journey to Jerusalem, having predicted his own death
there. Jesus makes a triumphal entry into Jerusalem, and once there friction
with the Pharisees increases and one of his disciples agrees to betray him for
thirty pieces of silver. In the gospel accounts, towards the end of the final
week in Jerusalem, Jesus has the Last Supper with his disciples, and the next
day is betrayed, arrested and tried. The trial ends in his crucifixion and
death. Three days after his burial, he is resurrected and appears to his
disciples over a 40 day period, after which he ascends to Heaven. Genealogy and
Nativity. The genealogy and Nativity of Jesus are described in two of the four
canonical gospels: Matthew and Luke. The genealogy of Jesus is described in and
While Luke traces the genealogy upwards towards Adam and God, Matthew traces it
downwards towards Jesus. Both gospels state that Jesus was begotten not by
Joseph, but by God. Both accounts trace Joseph back to King David and from
there to Abraham. These lists are identical between Abraham and David (except
for one), but they differ almost completely between David and Joseph. Matthew
gives Jacob as Josephâ€™s father and Luke says Joseph was the son of Heli.
Attempts at explaining the differences between the genealogies have varied in
nature, e.g. that Luke traces the genealogy through Mary while Matthew traces
it through Joseph; or that Jacob and Heli were both fathers of Joseph, one
being the legal father, after the death of Joseph's actual fatherâ€”but there
is no scholarly agreement on a resolution for the differences. Luke and Matthew
describe Jesus being born in Bethlehem, in Judea, to a virgin mother. Luke
features the Christmas story, in which Joseph and Mary, as part of a census,
travel to Bethlehem, where Jesus is born and laid in a manger. Angels proclaim
him a savior for all people, and shepherds come to adore him. In Matthew, wise
men follow a star to Bethlehem to bring gifts to Jesus, born the "King of the
Jews". King Herod massacres all the toddler boys in Bethlehem to kill Jesus,
but the holy family flees to Egypt and later settles in Nazareth. Scholars
debate whether these two accounts can be reconciled or not, and some view the
narratives as non-historical.< Some scholars view the discussion of historicity
as secondary, given that gospels were primarily written as theological
documents rather than chronological timelines. Other traditional Christian
scholars maintain that the two accounts do not contradict each other, pointing
to the similarities between them. Ministry. The five major milestones in the
gospel narrative of the life of Jesus are his Baptism, Transfiguration,
Crucifixion, Resurrection and Ascension. In the gospels, the ministry of Jesus
begins with his baptism in the countryside of Roman Judea and Transjordan, near
the river Jordan, and ends in Jerusalem, following the Last Supper with his
disciples. The Gospel of Luke () states that Jesus was "about 30 years of age"
at the start of his ministry. A chronology of Jesus typically has the date of
the start of his ministry estimated at around 27-29 AD/CE and the end in the
range 30-36 AD/CE. Jesus' "Early Galilean ministry" begins when after his
Baptism, he goes back to Galilee from his time in the Judean desert. In this
early period he preaches around Galilee and recruits his first disciples who
begin to travel with him and eventually form the core of the early Church as it
is believed that the Apostles dispersed from Jerusalem to found the Apostolic
Sees. The "Major Galilean ministry" which begins in Matthew 8 includes the
commissioning of the Twelve Apostles, and covers most of the ministry of Jesus
in Galilee. The "Final Galilean ministry" begins after the death of John the
Baptist as Jesus prepares to go to Jerusalem. In the "Later Judean ministry"
Jesus starts his final journey to Jerusalem through Judea. As Jesus travels
towards Jerusalem, in the "Later Perean ministry", about one third the way down
from the Sea of Galilee (actually a fresh water lake) along the River Jordan,
he returns to the area where he was baptized. The "Final ministry in Jerusalem"
is sometimes called the "Passion Week" and begins with Jesus' triumphal entry
into Jerusalem. The gospels provide more details about the final ministry than
the other periods, devoting about one third of their text to the last week of
the life of Jesus in Jerusalem. Locations of Ministry. In the New Testament
accounts, the principle locations for the ministry of Jesus were Galilee and
Judea, with activities also taking place in surrounding areas such as Perea and
Samaria. The gospel narrative of the ministry of Jesus is traditionally
separated into sections that have a geographical nature. The New Testament
accounts of the resurrection appearances of Jesus and his ascension are also in
the Judea area. Baptism and temptation. The Baptism of Jesus marks the
beginning of his public ministry. This event is recorded in the Canonical
Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke. In , rather than a direct narrative, John
the Baptist bears witness to the episode. In the New Testament, John the
Baptist preached a "baptism with water", not of forgiveness but of penance or
repentance for the remission of sins (), and declared himself a forerunner to
one who would baptize 'with the Holy Spirit and with fire' (). In so doing he
was preparing the way for Jesus. Jesus came to the Jordan River where he was
baptized by John. The baptismal scene includes the Heavens opening, a dove-like
descent of the Holy Spirit, and a voice from Heaven saying, "This is my beloved
Son with whom I am well pleased." Most modern scholars view the fact that Jesus
was baptized by John as an historical event to which a high degree of certainty
can be assigned. James Dunn states that the historicity of the Baptism and
crucifixion of Jesus "command almost universal assent". Along with the
crucifixion of Jesus most scholars view it as one of the two historically
certain facts about him, and often use it as the starting points for the study
of the historical Jesus. The "temptation of Jesus" is detailed in the gospels
of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. In these narratives, after being baptized, Jesus
fasted for forty days and nights in the Judaean Desert. During this time, the
devil appeared to Jesus and tempted him. Jesus having refused each temptation,
the devil departed and angels came and brought nourishment to Jesus. Calling
the disciples and early Ministry. The calling of the first disciples is a key
episode in the gospels which begins the active ministry of Jesus, and builds
the foundation for the group of people who follow him, and later form the early
Church. It takes place in , and on the Sea of Galilee. reports the first
encounter with two of the disciples a little earlier in the presence of John
the Baptist. Particularly in the Gospel of Mark the beginning of the ministry
of Jesus and the call of the first disciples are inseparable. In the Gospel of
Luke (), the event is part of the first miraculous catch of fish and results in
Peter as well as James and John, the sons of Zebedee, joining Jesus
vocationally as disciples. The gathering of the disciples in follows the many
patterns of discipleship that continue in the New Testament, in that who have
received someone else's witness become witnesses to Jesus themselves. Andrew
follows Jesus because of the testimony of John the Baptist, Philip brings
Nathanael and the pattern continues in where the Samaritan Woman at the Well
testifies to the town people about Jesus. This early period also includes the
first miracle of Jesus in the "Marriage at Cana", in the Gospel of John where
Jesus and his disciples are invited to a wedding and when the wine runs out
Jesus turns water into wine by performing a miracle. Minsitry and miracles in
Galilee. Jesus' activities in Galillee include a number of miracles and
teachings. The beginnings of this period include the The Centurion's Servant
(8:5-13) and Calming the storm (Matthew 8:23-27) both dealing with the theme of
faith overcoming fear. In this period, Jesus also gathers disciples, e.g. calls
Matthew. The Commissioning the twelve Apostles relates the initial selection of
the twelve Apostles among the disciples of Jesus. In the Mission Discourse,
Jesus instructs the twelve apostles who are named in to carry no belongings as
they travel from city to city and preach. Separately in relates the Seventy
Disciples, where Jesus appoints a larger number of disciples and sent them out
in pairs with the "Missionary's Mandate" to go into villages before Jesus'
arrival there. After hearing of the Baptist's death, Jesus withdraws by boat
privately to a solitary place near Bethsaida, where he addresses the crowds who
had followed him on foot from the towns, and feeds them all by "five loaves and
two fish" supplied by a boy. Following this, the gospels present the "Walking
on water" episode in , and as an important step in developing the relationship
between Jesus and his disciples, at this stage of his ministry. The episode
emphasizes the importance of faith by stating that when he attempted to walk on
water, Peter began to sink when he lost faith and became afraid, and at the end
of the episode, the disciples increase their faith in Jesus and in Matthew 14:
33 they say: "Of a truth thou art the Son of God". Major teachings in this
period include the Discourse on Defilement in Matthew 15:1â€“20 and Mark 7:
1â€“23 where in response to a complaint from the Pharisees Jesus states: "What
goes into a man's mouth does not make him 'unclean,' but what comes out of his
mouth, that is what makes him 'unclean.'". Following this episode Jesus
withdraws into the "parts of Tyre and Sidon" near the Mediterranean Sea where
the Canaanite woman's daughter episode takes place in and . This episode is an
example of how Jesus emphasizes the value of faith, telling the woman: "Woman,
you have great faith! Your request is granted." The importance of faith is also
emphasized in the Cleansing ten lepers episode in . In the Gospel of Mark,
after passing through Sidon Jesus enters the region of the Decapolis, a group
of ten cities south east of Galilee, where the Healing the deaf mute miracle is
reported in , where after the healing, the disciples say: "He even makes the
deaf hear and the mute speak." The episode is the last in a series of narrated
miracles which builds up to Peter's proclamation of Jesus as Christ in Mark 8:
29. Proclamation as Christ. The "Confession of Peter" refers to an episode in
the New Testament in which in response to Jesus' question to his disciples:
"Who do you say that I am?" Apostle Peter proclaims Jesus to be Christ - the
expected Messiah. The proclamation is described in the three Synoptic Gospels:
, and . Peter's Confession begins as a dialogue between Jesus and his disciples
in which Jesus begins to ask about the current opinions about himself among
"the multitudes", asking: "Who do the multitudes say that I am?" The disciples
provide a variety of the common hypotheses at the time. Jesus then asks his
disciples about their own opinion: "But who do you say that I am?" Only Simon
Peter answers him: "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God". In Jesus
blesses Peter for his answer, and later indicates him as the rock of the
Church, and states that he will give Peter "the keys of the kingdom of heaven".
In blessing Peter, Jesus not only accepts the titles "Christ" and "Son of God"
which Peter attributes to him, but declares the proclamation a divine
revelation by stating that his Father in Heaven had revealed it to Peter. In
this assertion, by endorsing both titles as divine revelation, Jesus
unequivocally declares himself to be both Christ and the Son of God. The
proclamation of Jesus as Christ is fundamental to Christology and the
Confession of Peter, and Jesus' acceptance of the title is a definitive
statement for it in the New Testament narrative. Transfiguration. The
"Transfiguration of Jesus" is an episode in the New Testament narrative in
which Jesus is transfigured (or metamorphosed) and becomes radiant upon a
mountain. The Synoptic Gospels (, , ) describe it, and refers to it. In these
accounts, Jesus and three of his apostles go to a mountain (the Mount of
Transfiguration). On the mountain, Jesus begins to shine with bright rays of
light. Then the prophets Moses and Elijah appear next to him and he speaks with
them. Jesus is then called "Son" by a voice in the sky, assumed to be God the
Father, as in the Baptism of Jesus. The Transfiguration is one of the miracles
of Jesus in the Gospels. This miracle is unique among others that appear in the
Canonical gospels, in that the miracle happens to Jesus himself. Thomas Aquinas
considered the Transfiguration "the greatest miracle" in that it complemented
baptism and showed the perfection of life in Heaven. The Transfiguration is one
of the five major milestones in the gospel narrative of the life of Jesus, the
others being Baptism, Crucifixion, Resurrection, and Ascension. In the New
Testament, Transfiguration is a pivotal moment, and the setting on the mountain
is presented as the point where human nature meets God: the meeting place for
the temporal and the eternal, with Jesus himself as the connecting point,
acting as the bridge between heaven and earth. Final journey to Jerusalem.
After the death of John the baptist and the Transfiguration, Jesus starts his
final journey to Jerusalem, having predicted his own death there. The Gospel of
John states that during the final journey Jesus returned to the area where he
was baptized, and states that "many people believed in him beyond the Jordan",
saying "all things whatsoever John spake of this man were true". The area where
Jesus was baptised is inferred as the vicinity of the Perea area, given the
activities of the Baptist in Bethabara and Ã†non in John and . Scholars
generally assume that the route Jesus followed from from Galilee to Jerusalem
passed through Perea. This period of ministry includes the Discourse on the
Church in which Jesus anticipates a future community of followers, and explains
the role of his apostles in leading it. It includes the parables of The Lost
Sheep and The Unforgiving Servant in Matthew 18 which also refer to the Kingdom
of Heaven. The general theme of the discourse is the anticipation of a future
community of followers, and the role of his apostles in leading it. Addressing
his apostles in 18:18, Jesus states: "what things soever ye shall bind on earth
shall be bound in heaven; and what things soever ye shall loose on earth shall
be loosed in heaven". The discourse emphasizes the importance of humility and
self-sacrifice as the high virtues within the anticipated community. It teaches
that in the Kingdom of God, it is childlike humility that matters, not social
prominence and clout. At the end of this period, the Gospel of John includes
the Raising of Lazarus episode in in which Jesus brings Lazarus of Bethany back
to life four days after his burial. In the Gospel of John, the raising of
Lazarus is the climax of the "seven signs" which gradually confirm the identity
of Jesus as the Son of God and the expected Messiah. It is also a "pivotal
episode" which starts the chain of events that leads to the crowds seeking
Jesus on his Triumphal entry into Jerusalem - leading to the decision of
Caiaphas and the Sanhedrin to plan to kill Jesus. Final week in Jerusalem. The
description of the last week of the life of Jesus (often called the Passion
week) occupies about one third of the narrative in the canonical gospels. The
narrative for that week starts by a description of the final entry into
Jerusalem, and ends with his crucifixion. The last week in Jerusalem is the
conclusion of the journey which Jesus had started in Galilee through Perea and
Judea. Just before the account of the final entry of Jesus into Jerusalem, the
Gospel of John includes the Raising of Lazarus episode, which builds the
tension between Jesus and the authorities. At the beginning of the week as
Jesus enters Jerusalem, he is greeted by the cheering crowds, adding to that
tension. The week begins with the Triumphal entry into Jerusalem. During the
week of his "final ministry in Jerusalem", Jesus visits the Temple, and has a
conflict with the money changers about their use of the Temple for commercial
purposes. This is followed by a debate with the priests and the elder in which
his authority is questioned. One of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, decides to
betray Jesus for thirty pieces of silver. Towards the end of the week, Jesus
has the Last Supper with his disciples, during which he institutes the
Eucharist, and prepares them for his departure in the Farewell Discourse. After
the supper, Jesus is betrayed with a kiss while he is in agony in the garden,
and is arrested. After his arrest, Jesus is abandoned by most of his disciples,
and Peter denies him three times, as Jesus had predicted during the Last
Supper. The final week that begins with his entry into Jerusalem, concludes
with his crucifixion and burial on that Friday. Passion. Betrayal and arrest.
In , , and , immediately after the Last Supper, Jesus takes a walk to pray,
Matthew and Mark identifying this place of prayer as Garden of Gethsemane.
Jesus is accompanied by Peter, John and James the Greater, whom he asks to
"remain here and keep watch with me." He moves "a stone's throw away" from
them, where he feels overwhelming sadness and says "My Father, if it is
possible, let this cup pass me by. Nevertheless, let it be as you, not I, would
have it." Only the Gospel of Luke mentions the details of the sweat of blood of
Jesus and the visitation of the angel who comforts Jesus as he accepts the will
of the Father. Returning to the disciples after prayer, he finds them asleep
and in Matthew 26:40 he asks Peter: "So, could you men not keep watch with me
for an hour?" While in the Garden, Judas appears, accompanied by a crowd that
includes the Jewish priests and elders and people with weapons. Judas gives
Jesus a kiss to identify him to the crowd who then arrests Jesus. One of Jesus'
disciples tries to stop them and uses a sword to cut off the ear of one of the
men in the crowd. Luke states that Jesus miraculously healed the wound and John
and Matthew state that Jesus criticized the violent act, insisting that his
disciples should not resist his arrest. In Jesus makes the well known
statement: "all who live by the sword, shall die by the sword". Trials. In the
narrative of the four canonical gospels after the betrayal and arrest of Jesus,
he is taken to the Sanhedrin, a Jewish judicial body. Jesus is tried by the
Sanhedrin, mocked and beaten and is condemned for making claims of being the
Son of God. He is then taken to Pontius Pilate and the Jewish elders ask Pilate
to judge and condemn Jesusâ€”accusing him of claiming to be the King of the
Jews. After questioning, with few replies provided by Jesus, Pilate publicly
declares that he finds Jesus innocent, but the crowd insists on punishment.
Pilate then orders Jesus' crucifixion. Although the Gospel accounts vary with
respect to various details, they agree on the general character and overall
structure of the trials of Jesus. After the Sanhedrin trial Jesus is taken to
"Pilate's court" in the "praetorium". Only in the Gospel of Luke, finding that
Jesus, being from Galilee, belonged to Herod Antipas' jurisdiction, Pilate
decides to send Jesus to Herod. Herod Antipas (the same man who had previously
ordered the death of John the Baptist) had wanted to see Jesus for a long time,
because he had been hoping to observe one of the miracles of Jesus. However,
Jesus says almost nothing in response to Herod's questions, or the vehement
accusations of the chief priests and the scribes. Herod and his soldiers mock
Jesus, put a gorgeous robe on him, as the King of the Jews, and sent him back
to Pilate. And Herod and Pilate become friends with each other that day: for
before they were at enmity. After questioning Jesus and receiving very few
replies, Herod sees Jesus as no threat and returns him to Pilate. After Jesus'
return from Herod's court, Pilate publicly declares that he finds Jesus to be
innocent of the charges, but the crowd insists on capital punishment. The
universal rule of the Roman Empire limited capital punishment strictly to the
tribunal of the Roman governor and Pilate decided to publicly wash his hands as
not being privy to Jesus' death. Pilate thus presents himself as an advocate
pleading Jesus' case rather than as a judge in an official hearing, yet he
orders the crucifixion of Jesus. Crucifixion and burial. Jesus' crucifixion is
described in all four canonical gospels, and is attested to by other sources of
that age (e.g. Josephus and Tacitus), and is regarded as an historical event.
After the trials, Jesus made his way to Calvary (the path is traditionally
called via Dolorosa) and the three synoptic gospels indicate that he was
assisted by Simon of Cyrene, the Romans compelling him to do so. In Jesus tells
the women in multitude of people following him not to cry for him but for
themselves and their children. Once at Calvary (Golgotha), Jesus was offered
wine mixed with gall to drinkÂ â€” usually offered as a form of painkiller.
Matthew's and Mark's gospels state that he refused this. The soldiers then
crucified Jesus and cast lots for his clothes. Above Jesus' head on the cross
was the inscription King of the Jews, and the soldiers and those passing by
mocked him about the title. Jesus was crucified between two convicted thieves,
one of whom rebuked Jesus, while the other defended him. Each gospel has its
own account of Jesus' last words, comprising the seven last sayings on the
cross. In Jesus entrusts his mother to the disciple he loved and in he states:
"Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do", usually interpreted as
his forgiveness of the Roman soldiers and the others involved. In the three
synoptic gospels, various supernatural events accompany the crucifixion,
including darkness of the sky, an earthquake, and (in Matthew) the resurrection
of saints. The tearing of the temple veil, upon the death of Jesus, is
referenced in the synoptic. The Roman soldiers did not break Jesus' legs, as
they did to the other two men crucified (breaking the legs hastened the
crucifixion process), as Jesus was dead already. One of the soldiers pierced
the side of Jesus with a lance and water flowed out. In , impressed by the
events the Roman centurion calls Jesus the Son of God. Following Jesus' death
on Friday, Joseph of Arimathea asked the permission of Pilate to remove the
body. The body was removed from the cross, was wrapped in a clean cloth and
buried in a new rock-hewn tomb, with the assistance of Nicodemus. In the Jews
go to Pilate the day after the crucifixion and ask for guards for the tomb and
also seal the tomb with a stone as well as the guard, to be sure the body
remains there. Resurrection and Ascension. Resurrection. The gospels state that
the first day of the week after the crucifixion (typically interpreted as a
Sunday), The followers of Jesus encounter him risen from the dead, after his
tomb was discovered to be empty. The New Testament does not include an account
of the "moment of resurrection" and in the Eastern Church icons do not depict
that moment, but show the Myrrhbearers, and depict scenes of salvation. The
resurrected Jesus then appears to his followers that day and a number of times
thereafter, delivers sermons and has supper with some of them, before ascending
to Heaven. The gospels of Luke and Mark include brief mentions of the
Ascension, but the main references to it are elsewhere in the New Testament.
The four gospels have variations in their account of the resurrection of Jesus
and his appearances, but there are four points at which all gospels converge::
the turning of the stone that had closed the tomb, the visit of the women on
"the first day of the week;" that the risen Jesus chose first to appear to
women (or a woman) and to told them (her) to inform the other disciples; the
prominence of Mary Magdalene in the accounts. Variants have to do with the
precise time the women visited the tomb, the number and identity of the women;
the purpose of their visit; the appearance of the messenger(s)â€”angelic or
human; their message to the women; and the response of the women. In , , and
his resurrection is announced and explained to the followers who arrive there
early in the morning by either one or two beings (either men or angels) dressed
in bright robes who appear in or near the tomb. The gospel accounts vary as to
who arrived at the tomb first, but they are women and are instructed by the
risen Jesus to inform the other disciples. All four accounts include Mary
Magdalene and three include Mary the mother of Jesus. The accounts of ,
indicate that Jesus appeared to the Magdalene first, and states that she was
among the Myrrhbearers who informed the disciples about the resurrection. In ,
to explain the empty tomb, the Jewish elders bribe the soldiers who had guarded
the tomb to spread the rumor that Jesus' disciples took his body. Resurrection
appearances. After the discovery of the empty tomb, the gospels indicate that
Jesus made a series of appearances to the disciples. In Jesus appears to Mary
Magdalene soon after his resurrection. At first she does not recognize him and
thinks that he isa gardener. When he says her name, she recognizes him but he
tells her Noli me Tangere, i.e. do not touch me, "for I am not yet ascended to
my Father." Later that day, at evening, Jesus appears to the disciples and
shows them the wounds in his hands and his side in John 20:19-21. Thomas the
Apostle is not present at that meeting and later expresses doubt about the
resurrection of Jesus. As Thomas is expressing his doubts, in the well known
Doubting Thomas episode in Jesus appears to him and invites him to put his
finger into the holes made by the wounds in Jesus' hands and side. Thomas then
professes his faith in Jesus. In , in the Great Commission Jesus appears to his
followers on a mountain in Galilee and calls on them to baptize all nations in
the name of the "Father, Son, and Holy Spirit". In the Miraculous catch of 153
fish Jesus appears to his disciples on the Sea of Galilee, and thereafter Jesus
encourages Apostle Peter to serve his followers. Ascension. The "Ascension of
Jesus" (anglicized from the Vulgate Latin section title: "Ascensio Iesu") is
the Christian teaching found in the New Testament that the resurrected Jesus
was taken up to heaven in his resurrected body, in the presence of eleven of
his apostles, occurring 40 days after the resurrection. In the biblical
narrative, an angel tells the watching disciples that Jesus' second coming will
take place in the same manner as his ascension. The canonical gospels include
two brief descriptions of the Ascension of Jesus in and . A more detailed
account of Jesus' bodily Ascension into the clouds is then given in the Acts of
the Apostles () where the narrative starts with the account of Jesus'
appearances after his resurrection and his Ascension forty days thereafter.
Acts 1:9-12 specifies the location of the Ascension as the "mount called
Olivet" near Jerusalem. states that Jesus: :"showed himself alive after his
passion by many proofs, appearing unto them by the space of forty days, and
speaking the things concerning the kingdom of God". After giving a number of
instructions to the apostles describes the Ascension as follows:"And when he
had said these things, as they were looking, he was taken up; and a cloud
received him out of their sight." Following this two men clothed in white
appear and tell the apostles that Jesus will return in the same manner as he
was taken, and the apostles return to Jerusalem. In , and (where Jesus as taken
up in glory) the Ascension is spoken of as an accepted fact, while Hebrews 10:
12 describes Jesus as seated in heaven.
