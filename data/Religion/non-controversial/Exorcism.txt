Exorcism Exorcism (from Greek á¼Î¾Î¿ÏÎºÎ¹ÏƒÎ¼ÏŒÏ‚, "exorkismos" - binding by
oath) is the religious practice of evicting demons or other spiritual entities
from a person or an area which they are believed to have possessed. Depending
on the spiritual beliefs of the exorcist, this may be done by causing the
entity to swear an oath, performing an elaborate ritual, or simply by
commanding it to depart in the name of a higher power. The practice is ancient
and part of the belief system of many cultures and religions. Requested and
performed exorcisms occurred rarely until the latter half of the 20th century
where the public saw a sharp rise due to the media attention exorcisms were
getting. There was â€œa 50% increase in the number of exorcisms performed
between the early 1960s and the mid-1970sâ€. Christianity. In Catholic
Christianity, exorcisms are performed in the name of Jesus Christ. A
distinction is made between a formal exorcism, which can only be conducted by a
priest during a baptism or with the permission of a Bishop, and "prayers of
deliverance" which can be said by anyone. The Catholic rite for a formal
exorcism, called a "Major Exorcism", is given in Section 13 of the Rituale
Romanum. The Ritual lists guidelines for conducting an exorcism, and for
determining when a formal exorcism is required. Priests are instructed to
carefully determine that the nature of the affliction is not actually a
psychological or physical illness before proceeding. In Catholic practice the
person performing the exorcism, known as an exorcist, is often a member of the
church, or an individual thought to be graced with special powers or skills.
The exorcist may use prayers, and religious material, such as set formulas,
gestures, symbols, icons, amulets, etc. The exorcist often invokes God, Jesus,
a litany of saints, and/or several different angels and archangels to intervene
with the exorcism. It may take several weekly exorcisms over several years to
expel a deeply entrenched demon. In general, possessed persons are not regarded
as evil in themselves, nor wholly responsible for their actions. Therefore,
practitioners regard exorcism as more of a cure than a punishment. The
mainstream rituals usually take this into account, making sure that there is no
violence to the possessed, only that they be tied down if deemed necessary for
their own protection and that of the practitioner. Hinduism. Beliefs and
practices pertaining to the practice of exorcism are prominently connected with
Hindus. Of the four Vedas (holy books of the Hindus), the Atharva Veda is said
to contain the secrets related to magic and alchemy. The basic means of
exorcism are the "mantra" and the "yajna" used in both Vedic and Tantric
traditions. Vaishnava traditions also employ a recitation of names of Narasimha
and reading scriptures, notably the "Bhagavata Purana" aloud. According to Gita
Mahatmya of Padma Purana, reading the 3rd, 7th and 9th chapter of Bhagavad Gita
and mentally offering the result to departed persons helps them to get released
from their ghostly situation. "Kirtan", continuous playing of mantras, keeping
scriptures and holy pictures of the deities (Shiva, Vishnu, Brahma, Shakti,
etc.) (especially of Narasimha) in the house, burning incense offered during a
"Puja", sprinkling water from holy rivers, and blowing conches used in "puja"
are other effective practices. The main puranic resource on ghost and death-
related information is Garuda Purana. A complete description of birth and death
and also about the human soul are explained in KatÅ Upanishad, a part of Yajur
Veda. A summary of this is also available as a separate scripture called
KÄttakaá¹ƒ. Islam. In Islam, exorcism is called "ruqya". It is used to repair
the damage caused by "sihr" or witchcraft. Exorcisms today are part of a wider
body of contemporary Islamic alternative medicine called al-Tibb al-Nabawi
(Medicine of the Prophet). Islamic exorcisms consist of the treated person
lying down, while a white-gloved therapist places a hand on a patientâ€™s head
while chanting verses from the Quran. The drinking of holy water may also take
place. Specific verses from the Quran are recited, which glorify God (e.g. The
Throne Verse (Arabic: Ø¢ÙŠØ© Ø§Ù„ÙƒØ±Ø³ÙŠ "Ayatul Kursi"), and invoke God's
help. In some cases, the "adhan"/"ah-zan" (the call for daily prayers) is also
read, as this has the effect of repelling non-angelic unseen beings or the
"jinn". The Islamic prophet Muhammad taught his followers to read the last
three "suras" from the Quran, Surat al-Ikhlas (The Fidelity), Surat al-Falaq
(The Dawn) and Surat al-Nas (Mankind). Judaism. Josephus reports exorcisms
performed by administering poisonous root extracts and others by making
sacrifices. The Dead Sea Scrolls mention that exorcisms were done by the Essene
branch of Judaism. In more recent times, Rabbi Yehuda Fetaya authored the book
"Minchat Yahuda", which deals extensively with exorcism, his experience with
possessed people, and other subjects of Jewish thought. The book is written in
Hebrew and was translated into English. Rabbi Gershon Winkler of New Mexico
explains that the procedure for a Jewish exorcism is intended not only to drive
away the possessing force, but to help both the possessor and the possessed in
an act of healing. The Jewish exorcism ritual is performed by a rabbi who has
mastered practical Kabbalah. Also present is a minyan (a group of ten adult
males), who gather in a circle around the possessed person. The group recites
Psalm 91 three times, and then the rabbi blows a shofar (a ram's horn). The
shofar is blown in a certain way, with various notes and tones, in effect to
"shatter the body" so that the possessing force will be shaken loose. After it
has been shaken loose, the rabbi begins to communicate with it and ask it
questions such as why it is possessing the body of the possessed. The minyan
may pray for it and perform a ceremony for it in order to enable it to feel
safe, and so that it can leave the person's body. Eric Sorensen's Hypothesis.
The origins of exorcism can be found in the effects of Zoroastrian and ancient
Near Eastern beliefs on early Judaism and Christianity. Zoroastrianismâ€™s
dualistic beliefs and apocalypticism is a nurturing ground for ideas of
exorcisms and possession. â€œThe spirit of Ahura Mazda is said to be with the
one who chooses good 33.14, and one can assume the same of the evil spirit for
those who chose evil. Mary Boyce underscores the importance of possession in
Zoroastrian doctrine: â€˜The concepts of divinity and of humanly possessed
power seem frequently to blend, through the thought of that power proceeding
from the divinity, who has himself actually entered into the person.â€
(p.Â 37) Zoroastrianism also introduces a connection between the spirit world
and its human host, albeit not in the same manner that characterizes later
Jewish and Christian thought. (p.Â 38) After person choses between good and
evil, a â€œmutually supportive symbiosis, takes place between the individual
and the spirit of choice,â€ according to Eric Sorensen. (p.Â 38) Identifying a
person with his good or evil benefactor converges with the rhetoric used by
Jewish sectarians and early Christians to consecrate their fellow believers and
demonize their opponents â€“ Sorensen gathers the evidence for this from E.H.
Pagelsâ€™ The Origin of Satan. (p.Â 39) Evidence for quasi-exorcisms in
Zoroastrianism lie in the laws of the Vendidad that provide purification
rituals for physical contaminations caused by demons. (p.Â 39) According to
James Darmesteter, the Zoroastrian understanding of â€œimpurity or uncleanness
may be described as the state of a person or thing that is possessed of a
demon; and the object of purification is to expel the demon.â€(p.Â 39) This
however, is not considered an exorcism in the manner in which it is thought of
today. â€œThe closest analogy to exorcism in the early Zoroastrian literature
is a reference to the followers of the Wise Lord (Ahura Mazda) as the
â€œexpellers of fury,â€ where â€œfuryâ€ is thought to be Aeshma, â€œthe only
demon mentioned by name in the Gathas, according to Boyce. (p.40) However, this
is still unlike the Christian accounts of demonic possession in which a demon
invades the hostâ€™s body and must be cast out to restore the body to its
natural and healthy state. (p. 40) The difference lies in the nature of choice
that is associated with Zoroastrian dualism. A person who allies himself with
evil is not necessarily a victim of it from whom malevolent influence must be
driven out; instead, he is seen to voluntarily involve himself with evil. (p.
40) The â€œexpulsionâ€ of demons was more an attempt to destroy those who
sided themselves with evil than remove evil influence. Yet, such
â€œexpulsions,â€ donâ€™t directly translate to exorcisms. A possible influence
is seen in the use of incantations for physical purifications from demons, seen
in the Vendidad. (p.Â 41) Despite the likely evidence, â€œthe influence of
Zoroastrianism upon Hellenism and Judaism has so far been difficult to
prove,â€ according to Sorensen. (p.Â 43) It is, however, widely noted that
there are, â€œstriking affinities between Zoroastrianism and Judaismâ€¦the
angelologies, demonologies, and the subjugation of evil evident in late
canonical and intertestamental writings such as Tobit, Daniel, and Qumranâ€™s
Community Rule offer tantalizing suggestions of Zoroastrianismâ€™s influence
upon Jewish thought.â€ (p.Â 45) â€œThe most explicit evidence of Zoroastrian
views on early Judaism is the demon Asmodeus in Tobit (II BCE). The name
Asmodeus derives from the Avestan words aÄ“Å¡ma daÄ“uua (â€œDemon of
Wrathâ€).â€ (p. 45) There is an increasing emphasis on possession, not in
terms of physical ailments, but with ethical decision-making that is seen in
early Jewish Pseudepigrapha; in a Sibylline Oracle, the Sibyl dictates that God
will â€œdwell in the maiden.â€ (p.Â 62) Ethical decision-making is reminiscent
of the choice one has to make in dualistic Zoroastrianism. Sven Hartman sees an
example of Zoroastrianâ€™s influence on Judaismâ€™s apocalyptic thought in the
figure of the devil, â€œwhom he considers the Jews to have modeled after Angra
Mainyu after their exposure to the Achaemenian and Parthian periods of
dominance in the Near East.â€ (p.Â 45) Exorcism finds its closest analogies in
the Hebrew Bible in two specific passages: â€œDavidâ€™s soothing of Saul in 1
Samuel and Godâ€™s rebuke of Satan in the book of Zechariah.â€ (p.Â 53) In the
former passage, an evil spirit plagues, but does not explicitly possess,
Saulâ€™s body; David plays a lyre as, â€œan exorcistic function,â€ to restore
Saul to a well state of being by making the evil spirit depart. (p.Â 53) In the
latter passage, Godâ€™s rebuke of Satan contains language similar to what is
found in New Testament exorcisms. (p.Â 54) Other evidence is found in Tobit,
the only apocryphal book in the Septuagint that supplies to the ideas of
exorcism. Eric Sorensenâ€™s linguistic research has concluded that in the
stories of Moses, Daniel, and Joseph, â€œfour of the six terms used of magical
practitioners have their origins in the Mesopotamian cultures of Assyria and
Babylonia. Linguistically, then, the Mesopotamian cultic and occult practices
influenced how Hellenistic Judaism interpreted magic and illicit conjurations
to exorcism.â€ (p.Â 57) The practice of exorcism and demonology becomes more
prominent in language and content in other Jewish intertestamental literature.
Particularly in their testaments and apocalypses, the documents from the
scrolls from the Judean desert and the Old Testament Pseudepigrapha, offer
near-contemporary views of possession and exorcism as viewed in the New
Testament; this is seen an sign that Near Eastern practices and beliefs came
into the same setting from which New Testament writings and other the synoptic
sources were to emerge. (p.Â 59) In the words of Eric Sorensen, â€œAlthough the
Hebrew Bible does not offer explicit evidence of exorcism, the Hellenistic
period does introduce the semantic groundwork for the demonology that would
become standard to the later presentations of exorcism in the New Testament.
During this time the Hebrew Bible was translated into Greek, and most of the
apocryphal documents were composed in Greek. Though Near Eastern demonic
personalities do not enter into the early Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible
(Old Greek Version), its derivatives are used to translate various Hebrew terms
for spiritual entities. These will come to refer often and exclusively to evil
spirits in the New Testament.â€ (p.Â 55) Scientific view. Demonic possession
is not a valid psychiatric or medical diagnosis recognized by either the DSM-IV
or the ICD-10. Those who profess a belief in demonic possession have sometimes
ascribed the symptoms associated with mental illnesses, such as hysteria,
mania, psychosis, Tourette's syndrome, epilepsy, schizophrenia or dissociative
identity disorder, to possession. In cases of dissociative identity disorder in
which the alter personality is questioned as to its identity, 29% are reported
to identify themselves as demons. Additionally, there is a form of monomania
called demonomania or demonopathy in which the patient believes that he or she
is possessed by one or more demons. The illusion that exorcism works on people
experiencing symptoms of possession is attributed by some to placebo effect and
the power of suggestion. Some supposedly possessed persons are actually
narcissists or are suffering from low self-esteem and act like a "demon
possessed person" in order to gain attention. Psychiatrist M. Scott Peck
researched exorcisms and claimed to have conducted two himself. He concluded
that the Christian concept of possession was a genuine phenomenon. He derived
diagnostic criteria somewhat different from those used by the Roman Catholic
Church. He also claimed to see differences in exorcism procedures and
progression. After his experiences, and in an effort to get his research
validated, he attempted but failed to get the psychiatric community to add the
definition of "Evil" to the DSM-IV. Although Peck's earlier work was met with
widespread popular acceptance, his work on the topics of evil and possession
generated significant debate and derision. Much was made of his association
with (and admiration for) the controversial Malachi Martin, a Roman Catholic
priest and a former Jesuit, despite the fact that Peck consistently called
Martin a liar and manipulator. Other criticisms leveled against Peck included
claims that he had transgressed the boundaries of professional ethics by
attempting to persuade his patients to accept Christianity.
