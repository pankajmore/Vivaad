Monasticism Monasticism (from Greek Î¼Î¿Î½Î±Ï‡ÏŒÏ‚, "monachos", derived from
Î¼ÏŒÎ½Î¿Ï‚, "monos", "alone") is a religious way of life that involves
renouncing worldly pursuits to fully devote one's self to spiritual work. The
origin of the word is from Ancient Greek, and the idea originally related to
Buddhist monks in 550 BC. In the Catholic, Orthodox, and Coptic Christian
traditions, males pursuing a monastic life are generally called "monks" while
female monastics are called "nuns". Both monks and nuns are considered
"monastics". The way of addressing monastics differs between the Christian
traditions. For a general rule, in Roman Catholicism, monks and nuns are called
brother or sister, while in Orthodox Christianity, they are called father or
mother. This is not an absolute rule as their address varies depending on their
rank and monastic tradition. Some other religions also include monastic
elements, most notably Buddhism, but also Hinduism and Jainism, though the
expressions differ considerably. Buddhism. The Sangha or community of ordained
Buddhist bhikkhus (similar to monks) and original bhikkhunis (similar to nuns)
was founded by Gautama Buddha during his lifetime over 2500 years ago. This
communal monastic lifestyle grew out of the lifestyle of earlier sects of
wandering ascetics, some of whom the Buddha had studied under. It was initially
fairly eremitic or reclusive in nature. Bhikkhus and bhikkunis were expected to
live with a minimum of possessions, which were to be voluntarily provided by
the lay community. Lay followers also provided the daily food that bhikkhus
required, and provided shelter for bhikkhus when they were needed. After the
Parinibbana (Final Passing) of the Buddha, the Buddhist monastic order
developed into a primarily cenobitic or communal movement. The practice of
living communally during the rainy vassa season, prescribed by the Buddha,
gradually grew to encompass a settled monastic life centered on life in a
community of practitioners. Most of the modern disciplinary rules followed by
bhikkhus and bhikkhunis â€” as encoded in the Patimokkha â€” relate to such an
existence, prescribing in great detail proper methods for living and relating
in a community of bhikkhus or bhikkhunis. The number of rules observed varies
with the order; Theravada bhikkhus follow around 227 rules. There are a larger
number of rules specified for bhikkhunis (nuns). The Buddhist monastic order
consists of the male bhikkhu assembly and the female bhikkhuni assembly.
Initially consisting only of males, it grew to include females after the
Buddha's stepmother, Mahaprajapati, asked for and received permission to live
as an ordained practitioner. Bhikkhus and bhikkhunis are expected to fulfill a
variety of roles in the Buddhist community. First and foremost, they are
expected to preserve the doctrine and discipline now known as Buddhism. They
are also expected to provide a living example for the laity, and to serve as a
"field of merit" for lay followersâ€”providing laymen and women with the
opportunity to earn merit by giving gifts and support to the bhikkhus. In
return for the support of the laity, bhikkhus and bhikkhunis are expected to
live an austere life focused on the study of Buddhist doctrine, the practice of
meditation, and the observance of good moral character. A bhikkhu (the term in
the Pali language) or Bhikshu (in Sanskrit), first ordains as a "Samanera"
(novice). Novices often ordain at a young age, but generally no younger than
eight. Samaneras live according to the Ten Precepts, but are not responsible
for living by the full set of monastic rules. Higher ordination, conferring the
status of a full Bhikkhu, is given only to men who are aged 20 or older.
Bhikkhunis follow a similar progression, but are required to live as Samaneras
for longer periods of time- typically five years. The disciplinary regulations
for bhikkhus and bhikkhunis are intended to create a life that is simple and
focused, rather than one of deprivation or severe asceticism. However, celibacy
is a fundamental part of this form of monastic discipline. Christianity.
Monasticism in Christianity provided the origins of the words "monk" and
"monastery" which comprises several diverse forms of religious living. It began
to develop early in the history of the Church, but is not mandated as an
institution in the scriptures. It has come to be regulated by religious rules
(e.g. the Rule of St Basil, the Rule of St Benedict) and, in modern times, the
Church law of the respective apostolic Christian churches that have forms of
monastic living. The Christian monk embraces the monastic life as a vocation
for God. His goal is to attain eternal life in his presence. The rules of
monastic life are codified in the "counsels of perfection". In the beginning,
in Syria and then in Egypt, Christians felt called to a more reclusive or
eremitic form of monastic living (in the spirit of the "Desert Theology" for
the purpose of spiritual renewal and return to God). Saint Anthony the Great is
cited by Athanasius as one of these early "Hermit monks". Especially in the
Middle East, eremitic monasticism continued to be common until the decline of
Syriac Christianity in the late Middle Ages. In the West, the most significant
development occurred when the rules for monastic communities were written, the
Rule of St Basil being credited with having been the first. The precise dating
of the Rule of the Master is problematic; but it has been argued on internal
grounds that it antedates the so-called Rule of Saint Benedict created by
Benedict of Nursia for his monastery in Monte Cassino, Italy (c. 529), and the
other Benedictine monasteries he himself had founded (cf. Order of St
Benedict). It would become the most common rule throughout the Middle Ages and
is still in use today. The Augustinian Rule, due to its brevity, has been
adopted by various communities, chiefly the Canons Regular. Around the 12th
century, the Franciscan, Carmelite, Dominican, Servite Order (see Servants of
Mary) and Augustinian mendicant orders chose to live in city convents among the
people instead of being secluded in monasteries. Today new expressions of
Christian monasticism, many of which ecumenical, are developing in places such
as the Bose Monastic Community in Italy, the Monastic Fraternities of Jerusalem
throughout Europe, and the TaizÃ© Community in France, and the mainly
Evangelical Protestant New Monasticism. Hinduism. In their quest to attain the
spiritual goal of life, some Hindus choose the path of monasticism (Sannyasa).
Monastics commit themselves to a life of simplicity, celibacy, detachment from
worldly pursuits, and the contemplation of God. A Hindu monk is called a
s"anyÄsÄ«, sÄdhu", or "swÄmi". A nun is called a "sanyÄsini", "sÄdhvi", or
"swÄmini". Such renunciates are accorded high respect in Hindu society,
because their outward renunciation of selfishness and worldliness serves as an
inspiration to householders who strive for "mental" renunciation. Some
monastics live in monasteries, while others wander from place to place,
trusting in God alone to provide for their physical needs. It is considered a
highly meritorious act for a lay devotee to provide sadhus with food or other
necessaries. SÄdhus are expected to treat all with respect and compassion,
whether a person may be poor or rich, good or wicked. They are also expected to
be indifferent to praise, blame, pleasure, and pain. A sÄdhu can typically be
recognized by his ochre-colored clothing. Generally, Vaisnava monks shave their
heads except for a small patch of hair on the back of the head, while Saivite
monks let their hair and beard grow uncut. Islam. Islam does not allow the
practice of monasticism. The stand of Islam is that while prohibiting sexual
license, it is also against suppressing the sexual urge, and, accordingly, it
calls people toward marriage, prohibiting renunciation and castration. As long
as a Muslim man possess the means to marry, he is not permitted to refrain from
marriage on the grounds that he has dedicated himself to the service or the
worship of Allah and to a life of monasticism and renunciation of the world.
The expression "Ù„Ø§Ù Ø±ÙÙ‡Ù’Ø¨ÙØ§Ù†ÙÙŠÙÙ‘Ø©Ù ÙÙÙŠ
Ø§Ù„Ø¥ÙØ³Ù’Ù„Ø§ÙÙ…Ù" â€œThere is no (room for) monasticism in Islamâ€, is
witnessed in numerous Islamic sources. It has been reported that Abu Qulabah
narrated: "Some of the Companions of the Prophet (peace be on him) decided to
relinquish the world, forsake their wives, and become like monks. The Prophet
(peace be on him) told them with asperity, People before you perished because
of their asceticism; they made excessive demands on themselves until Allah
brought hardships on them: you can still see a few of them remaining in
monasteries and temples. Then worship Allah and do not associate anything with
Him, perform the Hajj and the â€˜Umrah, be righteous, and all affairs will be
set right for you." (Reported by â€˜Abdur Razzaq, Ibn Jarir, and Ibn al-
Mundhir) Jainism. In Jainism, monasticism is encouraged and respected. Rules
for monasticism are rather strict. A Jain ascetic has neither a permanent home
nor any possessions, wandering barefoot from place to place except during the
months of Chaturmas. The quality of life they lead is difficult because of the
many constraints placed on them. They don't use a vehicle for commuting and
always commute barefoot from one place to another, irrespective of the
distance. They don't possess any materialistic things and also don't use the
basic services like that of a phone, electricity etc. They don't prepare food
and live only on what people offer them. Judaism. Judaism does not encourage
the monastic ideal of celibacy and poverty. To the contrary - all of the
Torah's Commandments are a means of sanctifying the physical world. As further
disseminated through the teachings of the Yisrael Ba'al Shem Tov, the pursuit
of permitted physical pleasures is encouraged as a means to "serve God with
joy" (Deut. 28:47). However, until the Destruction of the second temple, about
two thousand years ago, taking Nazirite vows was a common feature of the
religion. Nazirite Jews (in Hebrew: × ×–×™×¨) abstained from grape products,
haircuts, and contact with the dead. However, they did not withdraw from
general society, and they were permitted to marry and own property; moreover,
in most cases a Nazirite vow was for a specified time period and not permanent.
In Modern Hebrew, the term "Nazir" is most often used to refer to non-Jewish
monastics. Unique among Jewish communities is the monasticism of the Beta
Israel of Ethiopia, a practice believed to date to the 15th century. A form of
asceticism was practiced by some individuals in pre-World War II European
Jewish communities. Its principal expression was "prishut", the practice of a
married Talmud student going into self-imposed exile from his home and family
to study in the kollel of a different city or town. This practice was
associated with, but not exclusive to, the Perushim. The Essenes (in Modern but
not in Ancient Hebrew: , "Isiyim"; Greek: Î•ÏƒÏƒÎ·Î½Î¿Î¹, Î•ÏƒÏƒÎ±Î¹Î¿Î¹, or
ÎŸÏƒÏƒÎ±Î¹Î¿Î¹; "EssÄ“noi, Essaioi, Ossaioi") were a Jewish sect that
flourished from the 2nd century BCE to the 1st century CE which some scholars
claim seceded from the Zadokite priests. Being much fewer in number than the
Pharisees and the Sadducees (the other two major sects at the time), the
Essenes lived in various cities but congregated in communal life dedicated to
asceticism, voluntary poverty, daily immersion, and abstinence from worldly
pleasures, including (for some groups) marriage. Many separate but related
religious groups of that era shared similar mystic, eschatological, messianic,
and ascetic beliefs. These groups are collectively referred to by various
scholars as the "Essenes." Josephus records that Essenes existed in large
numbers, and thousands lived throughout Roman JudÃ¦a. The Essenes have gained
fame in modern times as a result of the discovery of an extensive group of
religious documents known as the Dead Sea Scrolls, which are commonly believed
to be Essenes' libraryâ€”although there is no proof that the Essenes wrote
them. These documents include preserved multiple copies of the Hebrew Bible
untouched from as early as 300 BCE until their discovery in 1946. Some
scholars, however, dispute the notion that the Essenes wrote the Dead Sea
Scrolls. Rachel Elior, a prominent Israeli scholar, even questions the
existence of the Essenes.
