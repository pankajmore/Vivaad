Catholic sex abuse cases The Catholic sex abuse cases are a series of
convictions, trials and investigations into allegations of child sexual abuse
crimes committed by Catholic priests and members of Roman Catholic orders
against children as young as 3 years old with the majority between the ages of
11 and 14.Reverend Oliver O'Grady later confessed to the abuse of many other
children and the documentary "Deliver Us from Evil (2006 film)" was made about
his story and the coverup by Church officials. These cases included anal sex,
and oral penetration, and there have been criminal prosecutions of the abusers
and civil lawsuits against the church's dioceses and parishes. Many of the
cases span several decades and are brought forward years after the abuse
occurred. Cases have also been brought against members of the Catholic
hierarchy who did not report sex abuse allegations to the legal authorities. It
has been shown they deliberately moved sexually abusive priests to other
parishes where the abuse sometimes continued. This has led to a number of fraud
cases where the Church has been accused of misleading victims by deliberately
relocating priests accused of abuse instead of removing them from their
positions. In the 1950s, Gerald Fitzgerald, "the founder of a religious order
that treats Roman Catholic priests who molest children concluded "(such)
offenders were unlikely to change and should not be returned to ministry," and
this was discussed with Pope Paul VI (1897¬ ‚Äì 1978) and "in correspondence
with several bishops." In 2001, sex abuse cases were first required to be
reported to Rome. "The Dallas Morning News" did a year-long investigation,
after the 2002 revelation that cases of abuse were widespread in the Church.
The results made public in 2004 showed that even after the public outcry,
priests were moved out of the countries where they had been accused and were
still in "settings that bring them into contact with children, despite church
claims to the contrary." Among the investigation's findings is that nearly half
of 200 cases "involved clergy who tried to elude law enforcement." In July
2010, the Vatican doubled the length of time after the 18th birthday of the
victim that clergymen can be tried in a church court and streamlined the
processes for removing "pedophile priests." The cases received significant
media and public attention in Canada, Ireland, and the United States, and
throughout the world. In response to the attention, members of the church
hierarchy have argued that media coverage has been excessive and
disproportionate. According to a Pew Research Center study, media coverage
mostly emanated from the United States in 2002, when a "Boston Globe" series
began a critical mass of news reports; by contrast, in 2010 much of the
reporting focused on child abuse in Europe. From 2001-2010 the Holy See, the
central governing body of the Catholic Church, has "considered sex abuse
allegations concerning about 3,000 priests dating back up to 50 years"
according to the Vatican's Promoter of Justice. In Ireland, a report (see
Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse) was made covering six decades (from the
1950s) noting "endemic" sexual abuse in Catholic boys' institutions with church
leaders aware of what was going on and government inspectors failing to "stop
beatings, rapes and humiliation." In Australia, according to Broken Rites, a
support and advocacy group for church-related sex abuse victims, as of 2011
there have been over one hundred cases where Catholic priests have been charged
for child sex offences. A 2012 police report detailed 40 suicide deaths
directly related to abuse by Catholic clergy in the state of Victoria. Of the
Catholic sexual abuse cases in Latin America the most famous is arguably of the
sexual scandal of Father Marcial Maciel, the leader of the Legion of Christ, a
Roman Catholic congregation of pontifical right made up of priests and
seminarians studying for the priesthood. This occurred after the Legion spent
more than a decade denying allegations and criticizing the victims who claimed
abuse. In Tanzania, Father Kit Cunningham together with three other priests
were exposed as paedophiles after Cunningham's death. The abuse took place in
the 1960s but was only publicly revealed in 2011, largely through a BBC
documentary. Church officials and academics knowledgeable about the Third World
Roman Catholic Church, say that sexual abuse by clergy is generally not
discussed, and thus is difficult to measure. This may be due in part to the
more hierarchical structure of the Church in Third World countries, the
"psychological health" of clergy in those regions, and because third word
media, legal systems and public culture are not as apt to thoroughly discuss
sexual abuse. In the Philippines where as of 2002 at least 85% of the
population is Catholic, the revelations of sexual abuse by priests, including
child sexual abuse, followed the United States' reporting in 2002. In the
United States, which has been the lead focus of much of the scandals and
subsequent reforms, BishopAccountability.org, an "online archive established by
lay Catholics," reports that over 3,000 civil lawsuits have been filed against
the church, some of these cases have resulted in multi-million dollar
settlements with many claimants. In 1998 the Roman Catholic Diocese of Dallas
paid $30.9 million to twelve victims of one priest ($ in present-day terms).
From 2003 to 2009 nine other major settlements involving over 375 cases with
1551 claimants/victims, resulted in payments of over $1.1 billion USD. The
Associated Press estimated the settlements of sex abuse cases from 1950 to 2007
totaled more than $2 billion. BishopAccountability puts the figure at more than
$3 billion in 2012. Addressing "a flood of abuse claims" five dioceses (Tucson,
Arizona; Spokane, Washington; Portland, Oregon; Davenport, Iowa, and San Diego)
got bankruptcy protection. Eight Catholic dioceses have declared bankruptcy due
to sex abuse cases from 2004-2011. International dimension of problem. Sexual
abuse of children under the age of consent by priests receives significant
media and public attention in Canada, Ireland, the United States, the United
Kingdom, Mexico, Belgium, France, Germany and Australia, while cases have been
reported throughout the world. Many of the cases span several decades and are
brought forward years after the abuse occurred. Although nation-wide enquiries
have only been conducted in the United States and Ireland, cases of clerical
sexual abuse of minors have been reported and prosecuted in Australia, New
Zealand, Canada and other countries. In 1994 allegations of sexual abuse on 47
young seminarians surfaced in Argentina. In 1995 Cardinal Hans Hermann Gro√´r
resigned from his post as Archbishop of Vienna, Austria over allegations of
sexual abuse, although he remained a Cardinal. Since 1995, over one hundred
priests from various parts of Australia were convicted of sexual abuse. In
Ireland, a report (see Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse) was made
covering six decades (from the 1950s) noting "endemic" sexual abuse in Catholic
boys' institutions with church leaders aware of what was going on and
government inspectors failing to "stop beatings, rapes and humiliation." In
Australia, according to Broken Rites, a support and advocacy group for church-
related sex abuse victims, as of 2011 there have been over one hundred cases
where Catholic priests have been charged for child sex offences. A 2012 police

in the state of Victoria. Of the Catholic sexual abuse cases in Latin America

at least 85% of the population is Catholic, the revelations of sexual abuse by
priests, including child sexual abuse, followed the United States' reporting in
2002. Academic Mathew N. Schmalz notes India as an example, "you would have
gossip and rumors, but it never reaches the level of formal charges or
controversies." Traditionally the Roman Catholic Church has held tight control
over many aspects of church life around the globe including "the words used in
prayer," but left sex abuse cases to be handled locally. In 2001 sex abuse
cases were first required to be reported to Rome. In "A Perspective on Clergy
Sexual Abuse" by Thomas Plante, a psychiatrist specializing in abuse counseling
and considered an expert on clerical abuse, he states "approximately 4% of
priests during the past half century (and mostly in the 1960s and 1970s) have
had a sexual experience with a minor." According to "Newsweek" magazine, the
figure is similar to that in the rest of the adult population. Allegations of
and convictions for sexual abuse by clergy have been subjects of public debate
in many countries. Although there are no figures available on the number of
sexual abuse cases in different regions, in 2002, "The Boston Globe" reported
"clearly the issue has been most prominent in the United States." The United
States is the country with the highest number of Catholic Sex Abuse cases,
leading Thomas Plante to surmise that the "crisis in the United States reached
epidemic proportions within the Church, the likes of which haven't been
witnessed before." After the United States, the country with the next highest
number of reported cases is Ireland. A significant number of cases have also
been reported in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and countries in Europe, Latin
America, Africa and Asia. In 2004, the John Jay report tabulated a total of
4,392 priests and deacons in the U.S. against whom allegations of sexual abuse
had been made. In response to the attention, members of the church hierarchy
have argued that media coverage has been excessive and disproportionate.
According to a Pew Research Center study, in 2002 the media coverage was
focused on the US, where a "Boston Globe" series initiated widespread coverage
in the region. However, by 2010 the focus had shifted to Europe. Church
officials and academics knowledgeable about Third World Roman Catholic Church,
say that sexual abuse by clergy is generally not discussed, and thus is
difficult to measure. This may be due in part to the more hierarchical
structure of the Church in Third World countries, the "psychological health" of
clergy in those regions, and because third word media, legal systems and public
culture are not as apt to thoroughly discuss sexual abuse. In 2001, sex abuse
cases were first required to be reported to Rome. In July 2010, the Vatican
doubled the length of time after the 18th birthday of the victim that clergymen
can be tried in a church court and streamlined the processes for removing
"pedophile priests." In September 2011, a submission was lodged with the
International Criminal Court alleging that the Pope, Cardinal Angelo Sodano
dean of the College of Cardinals, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone Vatican Secretary
of State and Cardinal William Levada head of the Congregation of the Doctrine
of the Faith, had committed a crime against humanity by failing to prevent or
punish perpetrators of rape and sexual violence in a "systematic and
widespread" concealment which included failure to co-operate with relevant law
enforcement agencies. In a statement to the Associated Press, the Vatican
described this as a "ludicrous publicity stunt and a misuse of international
judicial processes." Lawyers and law professors emphasised that the case is
likely to fall outside the court's jurisdiction. Contemporary history of child
sex abuse. Child sexual abuse is an umbrella term describing offenses in which
an adult engages in sexual activity with a minor or exploits a minor for the
purpose of sexual gratification. The American Psychiatric Association states
that "children cannot consent to sexual activity with adults," and condemns any
such action by an adult as "a criminal and immoral act which never can be
considered normal or socially acceptable behavior." Only at the beginning of
the 1900s did Western society begin to regard children as fledgling citizens
whose "creative and intellectual potential require fostering" rather than
"cheap labor." According to "The Atlantic" "the idea of the 'modern child' was
shaped by the same forces that shaped the rest of society: industrialization,
urbanization, and consumerism." Child sex abuse has gained public attention in
the past few decades and has become one of the most high-profile crimes. Since
the 1970s the sexual abuse of children and child molestation has increasingly
been recognized as deeply damaging to children and thus unacceptable for
society as a whole. While sexual use of children by adults has been present
throughout history, it has only become the object of significant public
attention in recent times. The first published work dedicated specifically to
child sexual abuse appeared in France in 1857: "Medical-Legal Studies of Sexual
Assault" "(Etude M√©dico-L√©gale sur les Attentats aux M≈ìurs)", by Auguste
Ambroise Tardieu, a noted French pathologist and pioneer of forensic medicine.

sexual abuse became a public issue in the 1970s and 1980s. Prior to this point
in time sexual abuse remained rather secretive and socially unspeakable.
Studies on child molestation were nonexistent until the 1920s and the first
national estimate of the number of child sexual abuse cases was published in
1948. By 1968, 44 out of 50 U.S. states had enacted mandatory laws that
required physicians to report cases of suspicious child abuse. Second wave
feminism (early 1960s to late 1990s) brought greater awareness of child sexual
abuse and violence against women, and made them public, political issues. Legal
action began to become more prevalent in the 1970s with the enactment of the
Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act in 1974 in conjunction with the
creation of the National Center for Child Abuse and Neglect. Since the creation
of the Child Abuse and Treatment Act, reported child abuse cases have increased
dramatically. The National Abuse Coalition was created in 1979 to create
pressure in congress to create more sexual abuse laws. In 1986, Congress passed
the Child Abuse Victims' Rights Act, giving children a civil claim in sexual
abuse cases. The number of laws created in the 1980s and 1990s began to create
greater prosecution and detection of child sexual abusers. Megan's Law which
was enacted in 2004 gives the public access to knowledge of sex offenders
nationwide. Anne Hastings described these changes in attitudes towards child
sexual abuse as "the beginning of one of history's largest social revolutions."
According to John Jay College of Criminal Justice professor B.J. Cling,
Lawsuits create awareness. In many jurisdictions growing awareness of child
sexual abuse has sparked an increasing number of civil lawsuits for monetary
damages stemming from such incidents. Increased awareness of child sexual abuse
has encouraged more victims to come forward, whereas in the past victims often
kept their abuse secret. Some states have enacted specific laws lengthening the
applicable statutes of limitations so as to allow victims of child sexual abuse
to file suit sometimes years after they have reached the age of majority. Such
lawsuits can be brought where a person or entity, such as a school, church or
youth organization, was charged with supervising the child but failed to do so
with child sexual abuse resulting. As lawsuits can involve demanding procedures
there is a concern that children or adults who file suit will be re-victimized
by defendants through the legal process, much as rape victims can be re-
victimized by the accused in criminal rape trials. Child sexual abuse
plaintiffs' attorney Thomas A. Cifarelli has written that children involved in
the legal system, particularly victims of sexual abuse and molestation, should
be afforded certain procedural safeguards to protect them from harassment
during the legal process. Representative statistics on offenders and victims.
In the United States the 2004 John Jay Report commissioned and funded by the
U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) was based on volunteer surveys
completed by the Roman Catholic dioceses in the United States. The 2004 John
Jay Report was based on a study of 10,667 allegations against 4,392 priests
accused of engaging in sexual abuse of a minor between 1950 and 2002. The
surveys filtered provided information from diocesan files on each priest
accused of sexual abuse and on each of the priest's victims to the research
team, in a format which did not disclose the names of the accused priests or
the dioceses where they worked. The dioceses were encouraged to issue reports
of their own based on the surveys that they had completed. Many of the reported
acts of sexual abuse involved fondling or unspecified abuse. There was also a
large number of allegations of forced acts of oral sex and intercourse.
Detailed information on the nature of the abuse was not reported for 26.6% of
the reported allegations. 27.3% of the allegations involved the cleric
performing oral sex on the victim. 25.1% of the allegations involved penile
penetration or attempted penetration. Although there were reported acts of
sexual abuse of minors in every year, the incidence of reported abuse increased
by several orders of magnitude in the 1960s and 1970s. There was, for example,
a more than sixfold increase in the number of reported acts of abuse of males
aged 11 to 17 between the 1950s and the 1970s. After peaking in the 1970s, the
number of incidents in the report decreased through the 1980s and 1990s even
more sharply than the incidence rate had increased in the 1960s and 1970s.
United States. Although bishops had been sending sexually abusive priests to
facilities such as those operated by the Servants of the Paraclete since the
1950s, there was scant public discussion of the problem until the mid-1960s.
Even then, most of the discussion was held amongst the Catholic hierarchy with
little or no coverage in the media. A public discussion of sexual abuse of
minors by priests took place at a meeting sponsored by the National Association
for Pastoral Renewal held on the campus of Notre Dame University in 1967, to
which all U.S. Catholic bishops were invited. Various local and regional
discussions of the problem were held by Catholic bishops in later years.
However, it was not until the 1980s that discussion of sexual abuse by Roman
Catholic clerics began to be covered as a phenomenon in the news media of the
United States. According to the Catholic News Service public awareness of the
sexual abuse of children in the United States and Canada emerged in the late
1970s and the 1980s as an outgrowth of the growing awareness of physical abuse
of children. In 1981 Father Donald Roemer of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles
pleaded guilty to felonious sexual abuse of a minor. The case received
widespread media coverage. In September 1983, the" National Catholic Reporter "
published an article on the topic. The subject gained wider national notoriety
in October 1985 when Louisiana priest Gilbert Gauthe pleaded guilty to 11
counts of molestation of boys. After the coverage of Gauthe's crimes subsided,
the issue faded to the fringes of public attention until the mid-1990s, when
the issue was again brought to national attention after a number of books on
the topic were published. In early 2002 the "Boston Globe"s Pulitzer Prize
winning coverage of sexual abuse cases involving Catholic priests drew the
attention, first of the United States and ultimately the world, to the problem.
Other victims began to come forward with their own allegations of abuse,
resulting in more lawsuits and criminal cases. Since then, the problem of
clerical abuse of minors has received significantly more attention from the
Church hierarchy, law enforcement agencies, government and the news media.
Bishop-Accountability.org, an "online archive established by lay Catholics,"
reports that over 3,000 "civil lawsuits have been filed against the church" in
the United States. Some of these cases involved many claimants and resulted in
multi-million dollar settlements. Ireland. Starting in the 1990s a series of
criminal cases and Irish government enquiries covered allegations that priests
had abused hundreds of minors over previous decades. State-ordered
investigations documented "tens of thousands of children from the 1940s to the
1990s" who suffered abuse including sexual abuse at the hands of priests, nuns
and church staff in three diocese. In many cases the abusing priests had been
moved by senior clergy to other parishes. By 2010 a number of in-depth judicial
reports had been published, but with relatively few prosecutions. The abuse was
occasionally made known to staff at the Department of Education, the police and
other government bodies, who have said that prosecuting clergy was extremely
difficult given the "Catholic ethos" of the Irish Republic. In 1994 Micheal
Ledwith resigned as President of St Patrick's College, Maynooth when
allegations of sexual abuse were made public. The June 2005 McCullough Report
found that a number of bishops had rejected concerns about Ledwith's
inappropriate behavior towards seminarians "so completely and so abruptly
without any adequate investigation" although his report conceded that "to
investigate in any very full or substantial manner, a generic complaint
regarding a person‚Äôs apparent propensities would have been difficult‚Äù. One
of the most notorious cases of sex abuse in Ireland involved Brendan Smyth,
who, between 1945 and 1989, sexually abused and indecently assaulted 20
children in parishes in Belfast, Dublin and the United States. Controversy over
the handling of his extradition to Northern Ireland led to the 1994 collapse of
the Fianna F√°il/Labour coalition government. Canada. In the late 1980s
allegations were made of physical and sexual abuse committed by members of the
Christian Brothers, who operated the Mount Cashel Orphanage in St. John's,
Newfoundland. The government, police and church colluded in an unsuccessful
attempt to cover up the allegations, but in December 1989 they were publicized
in the "St. John's Sunday Express". Eventually more than 300 former pupils came
forward with allegations of physical and sexual abuse at the orphanage. The
religious order that ran the orphanage filed for bankruptcy in the face of
numerous lawsuits. Since the Mount Cashel scandal a number of priests across
Canada have been accused of sexual abuse. In August 2006, Father Charles Henry
Sylvestre, of Belle River Ontario pled guilty to 47 counts of sexual abuse on
females, aged between nine and fourteen years old between 1952 and 1989.
Sylvestre was given a sentence in October 2006 of three years, and died January
22, 2007 after three months in prison. Belgium. In June 2010, Belgian police
raided the Belgian Catholic Church headquarters in Brussels, seizing a computer
and records of a Church commission investigating allegations of child abuse, as
part of an investigation into hundreds of claims that had been raised about
alleged child sexual abuse committed by Belgian clergy. The claims emerged
after Roger Vangheluwe, who had been the Bishop of Bruges, resigned after
admitting that he was guilty of sexual molestation. The Vatican protested
against the raids. Norway. In April 2010 it was reported that former bishop of
the Norwegian Catholic Church, Georg M√ºller, had confessed to the Norwegian
Police in early January 2010 that he had sexually abused an underaged altar boy
20 years earlier. The Norwegian Catholic Church was made aware of the incident
but did not alert the authorities. M√ºller was made to step down as a bishop in
July 2009. Austria. In November 2010, an independent group in Austria that
operates a hotline to help people exit the Catholic Church released a report
documenting physical, sexual, and emotional abuse perpetrated by Austrian
priests, nuns, and other religious officials. The report is based on hotline
calls from 325 victims - 91 women (28%) and 234 men (72%), who named 422
perpetrators of both genders - 63% of whom were ordained priests. Australia. In
2012 an Australian police report in the Victoria state jurisdiction detailed 40
suicide deaths by people who had been abused by Catholic clergy. The Chief
Commissioner of Victoria Police in a submission to a parliamentary inquiry on
the issue recommended that some of the church's actions to hinder
investigations be criminalized. In one diocese a dedicated clergy abuse police
strike force (Strike Force Lantle) has laid more than 170 abuse charges.
Lawsuits and their effects. The Associated Press estimated the settlements of
sex abuse cases from 1950 to 2007 totaled more than $2 billion.
BishopAccountability puts the figure at more than $3 billion in 2012. United
States. BishopAccountability.org, an "online archive established by lay
Catholics," reports that over 3,000 "civil lawsuits have been filed against the
church" in the United States, some of these cases have resulted in multi-
million dollar settlements with many claimants. The Roman Catholic Diocese of
Dallas paid $30.9 million in 1998 to twelve victims of one priest. In July 2003
the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Louisville paid $25.7 million to "settle
child sexual-abuse allegations made in 240 lawsuits naming 34 priests and other
church workers." In 2003 the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston also settled
a large case for $85 million with 552 alleged victims. In 2004, the Roman
Catholic Diocese of Orange settled nearly 90 cases for $100 million. In April
2007 the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Portland in Oregon agreed to a $75
million settlement with 177 claimants and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of
Seattle agreed to a $48 million settlement with more than 160 victims. In July
2007 the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles reached a $660 million
agreement with more than 500 alleged victims, in December 2006, the archdiocese
had a settlement of 45 lawsuits for $60 million. In September 2007 the Roman
Catholic Diocese of San Diego reached a $198.1 million "agreement with 144
childhood sexual abuse victims." In July 2008 the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of
Denver agreed "to pay $5.5 million to settle 18 claims of childhood sexual
abuse." The Associated Press estimated the total from settlements of sex abuse
cases from 1950-2007 to be more than $2 billion. According to
BishopAccountability reports that figure reached more than $3 billion in 2012.
Most sex abuse cases are subject to the law of each state. As of April 2010
many sex abusers associated with the Church in several countries have been
tried by secular authorities and some convicted and sentenced to imprisonment.
Addressing "a flood of abuse claims" five dioceses (Tucson, Arizona; Spokane,
Washington; Portland, Oregon.; Davenport, Iowa, and San Diego) got bankruptcy
protection. Eight Catholic diocese have declared bankruptcy due to sex abuse
cases from 2004-2011. According to Donald Cozzens, "by the end of the mid
1990s, it was estimated that [...] more than half a billion dollars had been
paid in jury awards, settlements and legal fees." This figure grew to about one
billion dollars by 2002. Roman Catholics spent $615 million on sex abuse cases
in 2007. As of March 2006, dioceses in which abuse was committed or in which
abuse allegations were settled out of court had made financial settlements with
the victims totaling over $1.5 billion. The number and size of these
settlements made it necessary for the dioceses to reduce their ordinary
operating expenses by closing churches and schools in order to raise the funds
to make these payments. Several dioceses chose to declare Chapter 11 bankruptcy
as a way to litigate settlements while protecting some church assets to ensure
it continues to operate. By 2009, U.S. dioceses have paid more than US$2.6
billion in abuse-related costs since 1950. In many instances, dioceses were
forced to declare bankruptcy as a result of the settlements. At least six U.S.
dioceses sought bankruptcy protection. In some cases, the dioceses filed
bankruptcy just before civil suits against them were about to go to trial. This
had the effect of mandating that pending and future lawsuits be settled in
bankruptcy court. The sexual abuse scandal costs each of the 195 diocese "an
average of $300,000 annually." Resignations, retirements and defrockings. Many
of the accused priests were forced to resign. Some priests whose crimes fell
within statutes of limitation are in jail. Some have been defrocked. Others ‚Äî
because they are elderly, because of the nature of their offenses, or because
they have had some success fighting the charges ‚Äî cannot be defrocked under
canon law. Some priests live in retreat houses that are carefully monitored and
sometimes locked. Bernard Francis Law, Cardinal and Archbishop of Boston,
Massachusetts, United States resigned after Church documents were revealed
which suggested he had covered up sexual abuse committed by priests in his
archdiocese. On December 13, 2002 Pope John Paul II accepted Law's resignation
as Archbishop and reassigned him to an administrative position in the Roman
Curia naming him archpriest of the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, and he
later presided at one of the Pope's funeral masses. Law's successor in Boston,
Archbishop (later Cardinal) Se√°n P. O'Malley found it necessary to sell
substantial real estate properties and close a number of churches in order to
pay the $120 million in claims against the archdiocese. Two bishops of Palm
Beach, Florida resigned due to child abuse allegations. Resigned bishop Joseph
Keith Symons was replaced by Anthony O'Connell, who later also resigned in
2002. Germany. According to "The Economist" and the "Sydney Morning Herald",
many Catholics are leaving the church in Germany due to the sex abuse scandal.
The number leaving in one month increased by a factor of four, to 472, in the
Munich diocese since the start of 2010. Additionally, the Germans' trust of the
Pope dropped significantly; in January 2010 62% of Catholic Germans trusted the
Pope, but by the end of March 2010, only 39% did. Norbert Denef founded
Netzwerk Betroffener von Sexualisierter Gewalt, briefly netzwerkB, in April
2010. Denef was abused as a child by Catholic clerics. Irish government
responses. In an address before the Irish parliament on May 11, 1999, Taoiseach
Bertie Ahern announced a comprehensive program to respond to the scandal of
abuse in the nation's Catholic-run childcare institutions. Ahern‚Äôs speech
included the first official apology to those who had been abused physically and
sexually while they had been in the care of these institutions. The Taoiseach
asked the abuse victims for forgiveness, saying: ‚ÄúOn behalf of the State and
of all citizens of the State, the Government wishes to make a sincere and long
overdue apology to the victims of childhood abuse for our collective failure to
intervene, to detect their pain, to come to their rescue.‚Äù In response to the
furor aroused by the media reports of abuse in Irish government institutions
run by religious orders, the Irish government commissioned a study which took
nine years to complete. On May 20, 2009, the commission released its 2600 page
report, which drew on testimony from thousands of former inmates and officials
from more than 250 institutions. The commission found that there were thousands
of allegations of physical abuse of children of both sexes over a period of six
decades. Over the same period there were also around 370 allegations of
children who had suffered various forms of sexual abuse from religious and
others. The report also revealed that government inspectors had failed in their
responsibility to detect and stop the abuse. The report characterized sexual
molestation as "endemic" in some church-run industrial schools and orphanages
for boys. In the wake of the broadcast of a BBC Television documentary "Suing
the Pope", which highlighted the case of Se√°n Fortune, one of the most
notorious clerical sexual offenders, the Irish government initiated an official
inquiry into the allegations of clerical sexual abuse in the Irish Roman
Catholic Diocese of Ferns. . The inquiry resulted in the publication of the
Ferns Report in 2005. In response to the Ferns Report, Ireland's Prime Minister
Brian Cowen stated that he was "ashamed by the extent, length, and cruelty" of
child abuse, apologized to victims for the government's failure to intervene in
sexual abuse and severe beatings in schools for much of the 20th century. Cowen
also promised to reform the Ireland's social services for children in line with
the recommendations of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse report. Irish
President Mary McAleese and Cowen made further motions to start criminal
investigation against members of Roman Catholic religious orders in Ireland. In
2009, The Murphy Report is the result of a three-year public inquiry conducted
by Irish government into the Sexual abuse scandal in Dublin archdiocese,
released a few months after the report of the Ryan report. The Murphy report
stated that, "The Commission has no doubt that clerical child sexual abuse was
covered up by the Archdiocese of Dublin and other Church authorities". It found
that, "The structures and rules of the Catholic Church facilitated that cover-
up." Moreover, the report asserted that, "State authorities facilitated that
cover-up by not fulfilling their responsibilities to ensure that the law was
applied equally to all and allowing the Church institutions to be beyond the
reach of the normal law enforcement processes." The report criticized four
archbishops ‚Äì John Charles McQuaid who died in 1973, Dermot Ryan who died in
1984, Kevin McNamara who died in 1987, and retired Cardinal Desmond Connell ‚Äì
for not handing over information on abusers to legal authorities. Church
responses. The responses of the Catholic Church to the sex abuse cases can be
viewed on three levels: the diocesan level, the episcopal conference level, and
the Vatican. Responses to the scandal proceeded at levels in parallel, with the
higher levels becoming progressively more involved as the gravity of the
problem became more apparent. For the most part, responding to allegations of
sexual abuse in a diocese was left to the jurisdiction of the local bishop or
archbishop. According to Thomas Plante, a psychiatrist specializing in abuse
counseling and considered an expert on clerical abuse, "unlike most large
organizations that maintain a variety of middle management positions, the
organizational structure of the Catholic Church is a fairly flat structure.
Therefore, prior to the Church clergy abuse crisis in 2002, each bishop decided
for himself how to manage these cases and the allegations of child sexual abuse
by priests. Some have handled these matters very poorly (as evidenced in
Boston) while others have handled these issues very well." After the number of
allegations exploded following the "Boston Globe"'s series of articles, the
breadth and depth of the scandals became apparent in dioceses across the United
States. The U.S. bishops felt compelled to formulate a coordinated response at
the episcopal conference level. Although the Vatican did not respond
immediately to the series of articles published by the "Boston Globe" in 2002,
it has been reported that Vatican officials were, in fact, monitoring the
situation in the U.S. closely. John L. Allen, Jr., senior correspondent for the
"National Catholic Reporter", characterized the reaction of the United States
Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) as calling for ‚Äúswift, sure and final
punishment for priests who are guilty of this kind of misconduct.‚Äù In
contrast to this, Allen characterized the Vatican's primary concern as wanting
to make sure ‚Äúthat everyone‚Äôs rights are respected, including the rights of
accused clergy" and wanting to affirm that it is not acceptable to "remedy the
injustice of sexual abuse with the injustice of railroading priests who may or
may not be guilty.‚Äù Diocesan responses. United States. According to the John
Jay Report one in four child sex abuse allegations were made within 10 years of
the incident. Half were made between 10 and 30 years after the incident and the
remaining 25% were reported more than 30 years after the incident.
Rehabilitation efforts. Since 2002, a major focus of the lawsuits and media
attention has been criticism of the approach taken by bishops when dealing with
allegations of sexual abuse by priests. As a general rule, the allegations were
not reported to legal authority for investigation and prosecution. Instead,
many dioceses directed the offending priests to seek psychiatric treatment and
for assessment of the risk of re-offending. In 2004, according to the John Jay
report, nearly 40% of accused priests participated in psychiatric treatment
programs. The remaining priests did not undergo abuse counseling because
allegations of sexual abuse were only made after their death. The more
allegations made against a priest, the more likely he was to participate in
treatment. Some bishops repeatedly moved offending priests from parish to
parish after abuse counseling, where they still had personal contact with
children. In response to these allegations, defenders of the Church's actions
have suggested that in re-assigning priests after treatment, bishops were
acting on the best medical advice then available. According to the USCCB,
Catholic bishops in the 1950s and 1960s viewed sexual abuse by priests as "a
spiritual problem, one requiring a spiritual solution, i.e. prayer". However,
starting in the 1960s, the bishops came to adopt an emerging view based on the
advice of medical personnel who recommended psychiatric and psychological
treatment for those who sexually abused minors. This view asserted that with
treatment priests who had molested children could safely be placed back into
ministry, although perhaps with certain restrictions such as not being in
contact with children. This approach viewed pedophilia as an addiction, such as
alcoholism which can be treated and restrained. Some of the North American
treatment facilities most frequently used for this purpose included the Saint
Luke Institute in Maryland; centers operated by the Servants of the Paraclete
in Jemez Springs, New Mexico, and St. Louis, Missouri; John Vianney Center in
Downingtown, Pennsylvania.; the Institute of Living in Hartford, Connecticut;
and the Southdown Institute near Toronto, Ontario in Canada. This approach
continued into the mid-1980s, a period which the USCCB characterizes as the
"tipping point in the understanding of the problem within the church and in
society". According to researcher Paul Isley, however, research on priest
offenders is virtually nonexistent and the claims of unprecedented treatment
success with clergy offenders have not been supported by published data.
Prevention efforts. The USCCB perceived a lack of adequate procedures for the
prevention of sexual abuse of minors, the reporting of allegations of such
abuse and the handling of those reports. In response to deficiencies in
canonical and secular law, both ecclesiastical and civil authorities have
implemented procedures and laws to prevent sexual abuse of minors by clergy and
to report and punish it if and when it occurs. In June 2002, the USCCB adopted
a zero tolerance for responding to allegations of sexual abuse. It promulgated
a Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People that pledged the
Catholic Church in the U.S. to providing a "safe environment" for all children
in Church-sponsored activities. The Charter instituted reforms to prevent
future abuse by requiring background checks for Church employees. The Charter
requires dioceses faced with an allegation to alert the authorities, conduct an
investigation and remove the accused from duty. A "Dallas Morning News" article
reported nearly two-thirds of the bishops attending the conference had covered
for sexually abusive priests. According to "Catholic News Service" by 2008, the
U.S. church had trained "5.8 million children to recognize and report abuse,"
run criminal checks on volunteers and employees and trained them to create a
safe environment for children. Reception by the laity. A 2006 study by Jesuit
Georgetown University Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate (CARA)
found lay Catholics were unaware of the specific steps that the church has
decided to take, but 78% strongly approved reporting allegations of sexual
abuse to civil authorities and 76% strongly approved of removing people
credibly accused of sexual abuse of a minor. Ongoing investigations. In 2005,
Kathleen McChesney of the USCCB said "In 2004, at least 1,092 allegations of
sexual abuse were made against at least 756 Catholic priests and deacons in the
United States. [ ... ] What is over is the denial that this problem exists, and
what is over is the reluctance of the Church to deal openly with the public
about the nature and extent of the problem." In early 2009, the sexual
impropriety including molesting boys by Marcial Maciel Degollado, the founder
of the Legion of Christ, a Roman Catholic congregation of pontifical right made
up of priests and seminarians studying for the priesthood, was disclosed
publicly. In March, the Vatican ordered an apostolic visitation of the sexual
abuse scandal in the Legion of Christ. In June 2009 Vatican authorities named
five bishops from five different countries, each one in charge of investigating
the Legionaries in a particular part of the world. Ireland. In June 2001, the
hierarchy of the Catholic Church in Ireland established the Catholic Church
Commission on Child Sexual Abuse (Ireland), also known as the Hussey
Commission, to investigate how complaints about clerical abuse of minors have
been handled over the last three decades. In February 2002, 18 religious orders
agreed to provide more than 128 million Euros (approximately $128 million) in
compensation to the victims of childhood abuse. Most of the money was raised
from church property transfers to the State; in fact the actual value of the
settlement is estimated to be about half that, and the Archbisop of Dublin in
2009 accused the orders of falling short even on the amount promised, and said
the church's failure to complete transfers of cash, property and land worth at
least ‚Ç¨128 million over the past seven years "is stunning". The agreement
also stipulated that any victims who accepted monetary settlements would waive
their right to sue both the church and the government, and that the identities
of the accused abusers was to be kept secret. In 2009 the orders agreed to
increase their contribution; it was learned that total compensation paid to
victims was about ‚Ç¨1.2 billion, so that until then the promised ‚Ç¨128¬ m had
been about 10% of the total. In September 2010 the Vatican announced that it
would shortly begin an investigation into how the Irish Catholic
Establishment's handling of the sex abuse and subsequent scandal. This enquiry
will include consulting groups representing victims. Co founder of Irish
Survivors of Child Abuse (Soca), stated that "Irish Soca and other survivors'
groups are excited over the apostolic visitation because it's the end of
allowing the Irish hierarchy to handle the scandal and crises on their own."
Philippines. When sexual scandals involving Catholic priests in the US came to
light in 2002, the Philippines media began reporting on abuses by local
priests. In July of that year, the Catholic Bishops Conference of the
Philippines apologized for sexual misconduct committed by its priests over the
last two decades and committed to drafting guidelines on how to deal with
allegations of such offenses. According to Archbishop Orlando Quevedo,
president of the Catholic Bishops Conference, about 200 of the country's 7,000
priests may have committed "sexual misconduct" ‚Äì including child abuse,
homosexuality and affairs ‚Äì over the past two decades. In August 2011,
activist women's group Gabriela assisted a 17-year old girl in filing sexual
abuse allegations against a priest in Butuan province. The bishop of Butuan,
Juan de Dios Pueblos, took the priest under his custody without handing him
over to civil and church authorities. This behaviour was also heavily
criticized by retired Archbishop Oscar Cruz, who blamed Pueblos for showing his
priests the "wrong way". Episcopal responses. United States. In other words,
the US National Review Board now requires dioceses faced with an allegation to
alert the authorities, conduct an investigation and remove the accused from
duty. The Board also approached John Jay College of Criminal Justice to conduct
a descriptive study of the nature and scope of the problem of child sexual
abuse in the Catholic Church. The College assembled an experienced team of
researchers with expertise in the areas of forensic psychology, criminology,
and human behavior, and, working with the Board, formulated a methodology to
address the study mandate. Data collection commenced in March 2003, and ended
in February 2004. United Kingdom. The 2001 Lord Nolan recommendations, accepted
in full by the bishops, became model guidelines for other bishops' conferences
around the world, and a model for other institutions in Britain. One guideline
was that in each parish there should be a "safeguarding officer", a lay person
who would vet‚Äîthrough an organization called the Criminal Records
Bureau‚Äîanyone in the parish who had access to young people or vulnerable
adults, and would be a contact for anyone with any concerns. Vatican responses.
John L. Allen, Jr., Vatican correspondent for the National Catholic Reporter,
has commented that many American Catholics saw the Vatican‚Äôs initial silence
on the Boston Globe stories as showing a lack of concern or awareness about the
issue. However, Allen said that he doesn't know anyone in the Roman Curia, who
was not at least horrified "by the revelations that came out of the Globe and
elsewhere" or who would defend "Cardinal Law‚Äôs handling of the cases in
Boston" or "the rather shocking lack of oversight that revealed itself" though
"they might have different analyses of what should have happened to him". Allen
described the Vatican's perspective as being somewhat skeptical of the media
handling of the scandal. In addition, he asserted that the Vatican viewed
American cultural attitudes toward sexuality as being somewhat hysterical as
well as exhibiting a lack of understanding of the Catholic Church. According to
Allen, cultural differences between the Vatican and American Catholics
complicated the process of formulating a comprehensive response to the sexual
abuse scandal: "there is a lot about the American culture and the American
Church that puzzles people in the Vatican, and there is much about the Vatican
that puzzles Americans and English speakers generally." 1962. Cardinal Alfredo
Ottaviani, Secretary of the Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office, sent a
letter which became known as the Crimen sollicitationis. In this letter,
addressed to "all Patriarchs, Archbishops, Bishops and other Local Ordinaries,
including those of Eastern Rite", the Holy Office laid down procedures to be
followed in dealing with cases of clerics (priests or bishops) of the Catholic
Church accused of having used the sacrament of Penance to make sexual advances
to penitents; its rules were more specific than the generic ones in the Code of
Canon Law. In addition, it instructed that the same procedures be used when
dealing with denunciations of homosexual, paedophile or zoophile behaviour by
clerics. It repeated the rule that any Catholic who failed for over a month to
denounce a priest who had made such advances in connection with confession was
automatically excommunicated and could be absolved only after actually
denouncing the priest to the Ordinary of the place or to the Holy Congregation
of the Holy Office, or at least promising seriously to do so. 1983. The Vatican
promulgated a revised Code of Canon Law which included a canon (1395,¬ß2) which
explicitly named sex with a minor by clerics as a canonical crime "to be
punished with just penalties, not excluding dismissal from the clerical state
if the case so warrants." According to De delictis gravioribus, the letter sent
in May 2001 by then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (now Pope Benedict XVI) - Prefect
of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, and according to Father
Thomas Patrick Doyle, who has served as an expert witness on Pontifical Canon
Law, Crimen Sollicitationis was in force until May 2001. 2001. In April, Pope
John Paul II issued a letter stating that "a sin against the Sixth Commandment
of the Decalogue by a cleric with a minor under 18 years of age is to be
considered a grave sin, or 'delictum gravius.'" In the letter, "Sacramentorum
sanctitatis tutela" (Safeguarding the Sanctity of the Sacraments), "¬ß1
Reservation to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF) is also
extended to a delict against the sixth commandment of the Decalogue committed
by a cleric with a minor below the age of eighteen years. ¬ß2 One who has
perpetrated the delict mentioned in ¬ß1 is to be punished according to the
gravity of the offense, not excluding dismissal or deposition." In other words,
the CDF was given a broader mandate to address the sex abuse cases only from
2001. All priestly sex crimes cases were to be placed under the CDF which, in
most cases, would authorize the bishops to conduct trials themselves. In May,
in line with the 1983 Code of Canon Law and the 1990 Code of Canons of the
Eastern Churches, a letter from the CDF was sent to the Catholic bishops. 2002.
The Vatican instituted reforms to prevent future United States abuse by
requiring background checks for all church employees who have contact with
children. Since then, in the USA alone, over 2 million volunteers and
employees; 52,000 clerics; 6,205 candidates for ordination have had their
backgrounds evaluated. In June, the USCCB established the "Charter for the
Protection of Children and Young People", a comprehensive set of procedures for
addressing allegations of sexual abuse of minors by Catholic clergy. (More
details in the Episcopal Responses section above.) 2003. Pope John Paul II
stated that "there is no place in the priesthood and religious life for those
who would harm the young". In April, the Pontifical Academy for Life organized
a three-day conference, entitled "Abuse of Children and Young People by
Catholic Priests and Religious", where eight non-Catholic psychiatric experts
were invited to speak to near all Vatican dicasteries' representatives. The
panel of experts overwhelmingly opposed implementation of policies of "zero-
tolerance" such as was proposed by the US Conference of Catholic Bishops. One
expert called such policies a "case of overkill" since they do not permit
flexibility to allow for differences among individual cases. 2004. In June, a
Louisville, Kentucky lawyer William McMurry filed suit against the Vatican on
behalf of three men alleging abuse as far back as 1928, accusing Church leaders
of organizing a cover up of cases of sexual abuse of children. 2005. In August
Pope Benedict was personally accused in a lawsuit of conspiring to cover up the
molestation of three boys in Texas by Juan Carlos Patino-Arango in Archdiocese
of Galveston-Houston. He sought and obtained immunity from prosecution as head
of state of the Holy See. Some have claimed that this immunity was granted
after intervention by then US President George W. Bush. The Department of State
"recognizeand allow[ed the immunity of Pope Benedict XVI from this suit." See
pope#International position for information on head-of-state immunity of a
pope. In November the Vatican published "Criteria for the Discernment of
Vocation for Persons with Homosexual Tendencies", issuing new rules which
forbid ordination of men with "deep-seated homosexual tendencies." While the
preparation for this document had started ten years before its publication,
this instruction is seen as an official answer by the Catholic Church to what
was seen as a "pedophile priest" crisis. The US National Review Board cited the
preponderance of adolescent males among the victims of clerical sexual abuse of
minors in its report. The document was criticized for what some see as its
implying that homosexuality is tied to the sexual abuse of children. 2007.
Archbishop Csaba Ternyak, secretary of the Congregation for Clergy, put the
following question to the experts: "o what degree one can talk about the
rehabilitation of the offender, what are the most effective methods of
treatment, and on what grounds we can say that a person who has never offended
is at risk to sexually molest someone?" Ternyak spoke about the way that the
crisis had damaged the priest-bishop relationship. He noted that there was a
"sense of gloom" felt by the overwhelming majority of priests who had not been
accused of any abuse but nonetheless who perceived that their bishops had
turned against them and therefore had "become disillusioned about the
effectiveness of the laws of the Church to defend their dignity and their
inalienable rights". Ternyak also noted that "there have been more than a few
suicides among accused priests." 2008. In April, during a visit to the United
States, Pope Benedict admitted that he was "deeply ashamed" of the clergy sex
abuse scandal that has devastated the American church. Benedict pledged that
pedophiles would not be priests in the Roman Catholic Church. Pope Benedict
also said he is ashamed for child abuse scandal in Australia. In November the
United States Court of Appeals in Cincinnati denied the Vatican's claim of
sovereign immunity and allowed a lawsuit against the Catholic Church government
by three men who claim they were sexually abused as children by priests in the
Louisville, Ky., USA archdiocese to proceed. The Vatican did not appeal the
ruling. 2009. Two researchers reported that abuse cases had "steeply declined"
after 1985 and that responses to abuse had changed substantially over 50 years,
with suspension becoming more common than reinstatement. In a statement, read
out by Archbishop Silvano Maria Tomasi at a meeting of the United Nations Human
Rights Council in Geneva on 22 September 2009, the Holy See stated that the
majority of Catholic clergy who had committed acts of sexual abuse against
under 18 year olds should not be viewed as paedophiles, but as homosexuals who
are attracted to sex with adolescent males. The statement said that rather than
paedophilia, "it would be more correct to speak of ephebophilia; being a
homosexual attraction to adolescent males[...] Of all priests involved in the
abuses, 80 to 90% belong to this sexual orientation minority which is sexually
engaged with adolescent boys between the ages of 11 and 17." However, Margaret
Smith and Karen Terry, two researchers who worked on the John Jay Report,
cautioned against equating the high incidence of abuse by priests against boys
with homosexuality, calling it an oversimplification and ‚Äúan unwarranted
conclusion‚Äù, as ‚Äúparticipation in homosexual acts is not the same as sexual
identity as a gay man.‚Äù Tomasi's move angered many gay rights organisations,
who claimed it was an attempt by the Vatican to redefine the Church's past
problems with paedophilia as problems with homosexuality. The empirical
research shows that sexual orientation does not affect the likelihood that
people will abuse children. Many child molesters cannot be characterized as
having an adult sexual orientation at all; they are fixated on children. 2010.
In April 2010, in response to extensive negative publicity and criticism of the
Pope, the Vatican entered what the Associated Press called "full damage control
mode". Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, the Vatican's secretary of state, during a
visit to Chile, linked the scandal to homosexuality. In response to widespread
criticism of that statement, Vatican spokesman, Federico Lombardi said
Bertone's statement went outside the remit of "church authorities" while
maintaining that "the statement was aimed at 'clarifying' Cardinal Bertone's
remarks and should not be seen as the Holy See 'distancing' itself from them."
He also noted that 10 per cent of the cases concerned paedophilia in the
"strict sense" and the other 90 per cent concerned sex between priests and
adolescents. Giovanni Maria Vian, editor of L'Osservatore Romano, the Vatican's
official newspaper, said the continuing criticism of Pope Benedict XVI and the
Vatican in handling the clerical sex abuse crisis is part of a media campaign
to sell newspapers. The Pope issued a statement that the "Church must do
penance for abuse cases". Msgr. Charles J. Scicluna explained in an interview
with the Italian newspaper "Avvenire": "Between 1975 and 1985 I do not believe
that any cases of pedophilia committed by priests were brought to the attention
of our Congregation. Moreover, following the promulgation of the 1983 Code of
Canon Law, there was a period of uncertainty as to which of the "delicta
graviora" were reserved to the competency of this dicastery. Only with the 2001
"Motu Proprio" did the crime of pedophilia again become our exclusive remit...
In the years (2001‚Äì2010) the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF)
had "considered accusations concerning around three thousand cases of diocesan
and religious priests, which refer to crimes committed over the last fifty
years." In July 2010 the Vatican issued a document to clarify their position.
They doubled the length of time after the 18th birthday of the victim that
clergymen can be tried in a church court and to streamline the processes for
removing pedophile priests. However the new rules are less strict than those
already in place in the United States and lack the clarity that pedophilia is a
civil offense of the existing rules there. 2011. In May the Vatican published
new guidelines, drawn up by Cardinal William Levada, the head of the
Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith, on dealing with the clergy sexual
abuse cases. The guidelines tell the bishops and heads of Catholic religious
orders worldwide to develop "clear and coordinated" procedures for dealing with
the sexual abuse allegation by May 2012. The guidelines instruct the bishops to
cooperate with the police and respect the relevant local laws in investigating
and reporting allegations of sexual abuse by the clergy to the civic
authorities, but do not make such reporting mandatory. The guidelines also
reinforce bishops' exclusive authority in dealing with abuse cases. Victims
advocacy groups criticized the new guidelines as insufficient, arguing that the
recommendations do not have the status of church law and do not provide any
specific enforcement mechanisms. Criticisms of church responses. While the
Church in the United States claims to have addressed the issue, some disagree.
As Mark Honigsbaum from The Guardian put it in 2006, "...despite the National
Review Board's own estimates that there have been some 5,000 abusive priests in
the US, to date 150 have been successfully prosecuted." Some critics of the
Church such as Patrick Wall attribute this to a lack of cooperation from the
church. In California, for example, the archdiocese has sought to block the
disclosure of confidential counseling records on two priests arguing that such
action would violate their First Amendment right on religious protection. In
2010, BBC reported that the latest research by experts indicate that Catholic
priests may be no more likely than others to abuse. However, a major cause of
the scandal was the cover-ups and other alleged shortcomings in the way the
church has dealt with the abuses. Particularly, the actions of Catholic bishops
in responding to allegations of clerical abuse came under harsh criticism. In
September 2010, Pope Benedict XVI lamented that the Roman Catholic Church had
not been vigilant enough or quick enough in responding to the problem of sexual
abuse by Catholic clergy A representative of SNAP, a group representing abuse
victims criticized the pope's remarks as "disingenuous" because, in her
opinion, the Church had in fact been "prompt and vigilant" in concealing the
scandal. For non-removal. The Catholic hierarchy has been criticized for not
acting more quickly and decisively to remove, defrock and report priests
accused of sexual misconduct. In response to such criticism, contemporary
bishops have asserted that the hierarchy was unaware until recent years of the
danger in shuffling priests from one parish to another and in concealing the
priests' problems from those they served. For example, Cardinal Roger Mahony of
the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, said: "We have said repeatedly that ... our
understanding of this problem and the way it's dealt with today evolved, and
that in those years ago, decades ago, people didn't realize how serious this
was, and so, rather than pulling people out of ministry directly and fully,
they were moved." One early opponent of the treatment of sexually abusive
priests was Father Gerald Fitzgerald, the founder of The Congregation of the
Servants of the Paraclete. Although Fitzgerald started the Servants of the
Paraclete to assist priests who were struggling with alcohol and substance
abuse problems, he soon began receiving priests who had sexually abused minors.
Initially, Fitzgerald attempted to treat such priests using the same spiritual
methods that he used with his other "guests". However, as he grew convinced of
the futility of treating sexually abusive priests, Fitzgerald came to oppose
vehemently the return of sexual abusers to duties as parish priests. He wrote
regularly to bishops in the United States and to Vatican officials, including
the pope, of his opinion that many sexual abusers in the priesthood could not
be cured and should be defrocked immediately. Eventually, Fitzgerald lost
control of the Servants of the Paraclete. The center began to employ medical
and psychological professionals who added psychiatry and medical treatment to
the spiritual regimen of treatment favored by Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald continued
to oppose these modifications to his treatment regimen until his death in 1969.
Bishop Manuel D. Moreno of Tucson, Arizona, USA repeatedly attempted to have
two local abusive priests defrocked and disciplined, pleading unsuccessfully in
a letter of April 1997 with Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger as head of the
Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith to have one of them, who was first
suspended in 1990 and convicted by the church in 1997 of five crimes including
sexual solicitation in the confessional, defrocked. The two were finally
defrocked in 2004. Bishop Moreno had been heavily criticized for failing to
take action until details of his efforts became public. In a New York Times
article, Bishop Blase J. Cupich, chairman of the United States Bishops
Committee for the Protection of Children and Young People, is quoted explaining
why Father Fitzgerald‚Äôs advice "went largely unheeded for 50 years": First,
"cases of sexually abusive priests were considered to be rare." Second, Father
Fitzgerald's, ‚Äúviews, by and large, were considered bizarre with regard to
not treating people medically, but only spiritually, and also segregating a
whole population with sexual problems on a deserted island.‚Äù And finally,
‚ÄúThere was mounting evidence in the world of psychology that indicated that
when medical treatment is given, these people can, in fact, go back to
ministry.‚Äù This was a view which Cupich characterized as one that "the
bishops came to regret." In 2012, Monsignor William Lynn became the first
United States church official to be convicted of child endangerment because of
his part in covering up child sex abuse allegations by clergy. Lynn was
responsible for making recommendations as to the assignment of clergy in the
Archdiocese of Philadelphia. He was found guilty of one count of endangering
the welfare of a child. On July 24, 2012, Lynn was sentenced to three to six
years in prison. For secrecy among bishops. It was revealed that some bishops
had facilitated compensation payments to victims on condition that the
allegations remained secret. For example, according to the "Boston Globe", the
Archdiocese of Boston secretly settled child sexual abuse claims against at
least 70 priests from 1992 to 2002.  In April 2010, Christopher Hitchens and
Richard Dawkins wanted to prosecute the Pope for crimes against humanity due to
what they see as his role in intentionally covering up abuse by priests. In a
CNN interview a few days later, however, Dawkins declined to discuss the
international crime law courts definition of crime against humanity, saying it
is a difficult legal question. In April 2010, a lawsuit was filed in the
Milwaukee Federal Court by an anonymous "John Doe 16" against the Vatican and
Pope Benedict XVI. The plaintiff accused Ratzinger and others of having covered
up abuse cases to avoid scandal to the detriment of the concerned children. In
February 2011, two German lawyers initiated charges against Pope Benedict XVI
at the International Criminal Court. As one of the reasons for the charges they
referred also to the "strong suspicion" that Joseph Ratzinger, as head of the
Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, covered up the sexual abuse of
children and youths and protected the perpetrators. Internal division became
public, with Christoph Cardinal Sch√∂nborn accusing Cardinal Angelo Sodano of
blocking Ratzinger‚Äôs investigation of a high-profile case in the mid 1990s.
In the case of the French bishop Pierre Pican, who did not denounce an abusive
priest before trial and as a consequence received a suspended jail sentence,
the retired Cardinal Dario Castrillon Hoyos wrote a letter to support Pican in
his decision. Exposed to heavy critiques Hoyos, claimed to have had the
approval of Pope John Paul II. In 2011 Hoyos was heavily criticized again. This
time the Congregation for the Clergy was blamed of having opposed in 1997 to
the newly adapted rules of the Irish bishops, demanding the denouncement of
every abusive priest to the police. The Archbishop of Dublin Diarmuid Martin
described the cooperation with the Congregation for the Clergy as "disastrous".
For lack of transparency in Vatican proceedings. To place the cases under the
competence of the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith has been
criticized by some as making the process more secretive and lengthening the
time required to address the allegations. For example, in his biography of John
Paul II, David Yallop asserts that the backlog of referrals to the Congregation
for the Doctrine of the Faith for action against sexually abusive priests is so
large that it takes 18 months to merely get a reply. Vatican officials have
expressed concern that the church's insistence on confidentiality in its
treatment of priestly sexual abuse cases was seen as a ban on reporting serious
accusations to the civil authorities. Early in 2010 Cardinal Claudio Hummes,
the head of the Congregation for Clergy, finally said that instances of sexual
abuse by priests were "criminal facts" as well as serious sins and required co-
operation with the civil justice system. Italian academic Lucetta Scaraffia
described the conspiracy involved in hiding the offence as "omerta", the Mafia
code of silence, and said that "We can hypothesise that a greater female
presence, not at a subordinate level, would have been able to rip the veil of
masculine secrecy that in the past often covered the denunciation of these
misdeeds with silence". Some parties have interpreted the "Crimen
sollicitationis" - a 1962 document ("Instruction") of the Holy Office (which is
now called the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith) codifying procedures
to be followed in cases of priests or bishops of the Catholic Church accused of
having used the sacrament of Penance to make sexual advances to penitents - as
a directive from the Vatican to keep all allegations of sexual abuse secret,
leading to widespread media coverage of its contents. Lawyers for some of those
making abuse allegations claimed that the document demonstrated a systematic
conspiracy to conceal such crimes. The Vatican responded that the document was
not only widely misinterpreted, but moreover had been superseded by more recent
guidelines in the 1960s and 1970s, and especially the 1983 Code of Canon Law.
Media coverage. The media coverage of Catholic sex abuse cases is a major
aspect of the academic literature surrounding the pederastic priest scandal. In
2002 there was discovery that the sex abuse by Catholic priests was widespread
in the U.S. which received significant media coverage. For the first 100 days
the "New York Times" had 225 pieces, including news and commentary and the
story appeared on the front page on 26 occasions. Walter V. Robinson, an
American journalist and journalism professor led the "Boston Globe"'s coverage
of the Roman Catholic sex abuse cases, for which the newspaper won the Pulitzer
Prize for Public Service. Robinson was also a Pulitzer Prize finalist in
Investigative Reporting in 2007. In Ireland television journalism played a key
role in helping public awareness of widespread sexual abuse of children by
priests. BBC documentary in 2006. Produced by a victim of clerical sex abuse
for the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) in 2006, the documentary "Sex
Crimes and the Vatican" included the claim that all allegations of sex abuse
are to be sent to the Vatican rather than the civil authorities, and that "a
secret church decree called 'Crimen sollicitationis' ... imposes the strictest
oath of secrecy on the child victim, the priest dealing with the allegation,
and any witnesses. Breaking that oath means instant banishment from the
Catholic Church - excommunication." The documentary quoted the 2005 Ferns
Report: "A culture of secrecy and fear of scandal that led bishops to place the
interests of the Catholic Church ahead of the safety of children". Canon lawyer
Thomas Doyle, who was included in the documentary as supporting the picture
that it presented, later wrote with regard to the 1962 "Crimen sollicitations"
and the 2001 "De delictis gravioribus" as well as the Church's formal
investigation into charges of abuse: "There is no basis to assume that the Holy
See envisioned this process to be a substitute for any secular legal process,
criminal or civil. It is also incorrect to assume, as some have unfortunately
done, that these two Vatican documents are proof of a conspiracy to hide
sexually abusive priests or to prevent the disclosure of sexual crimes
committed by clerics to secular authorities." However, two years later in 2008
Doyle said of attempts to reform the Catholic Church that it was like "trudging
through what can best be described as a swamp of toxic waste". The Church was
reluctant to hand over to the civil authorities information about the Church's
own investigations into charges. In the BBC documentary, Rick Romley, a
district attorney who initiated an investigation of the Diocese of Phoenix,
stated that "the secrecy, the obstruction I saw during my investigation was
unparalleled in my entire career as a DA...it was so difficult to obtain any
information from the Church at all." He reported archives of documents and
incriminating evidence pertaining to sex abuse that were kept from the
authorities, which under the law could not be subpoenaed. "The Church fails to
acknowledge such a serious problem but more than that, it is not a passiveness
but an openly obstructive way of not allowing authorities to try to stop the
abuse within the Church. They fought us every step of the way." Debate over
causes. There have been many debates over the causes of sex abuse cases.
Seminary training. The 2004 John Jay Report stated "the problem was largely the
result of poor seminary training and insufficient emotional support for men
ordained in the 1940s and 1950s." Impact of psychology from previous decades.
Some bishops and psychiatrists have asserted that the prevailing psychology of
the times suggested that people could be cured of such behavior through
counseling. Thomas Plante, a psychiatrist specializing in abuse counseling and
considered an expert on clerical abuse, states "the vast majority of the
research on sexual abuse of minors didn't emerge until the early 1980's. So, it
appeared reasonable at the time to treat these men and then return them to
their priestly duties. In hindsight, this was a tragic mistake." Robert S.
Bennett, the Roman Catholic Washington attorney who headed the National Review
Board's research committee, named "too much faith in psychiatrists" as one of
the key problems concerning Catholic sex abuse cases. About 40% of the abusive
priests had received counseling before being reassigned. Pedophilia and
ephebophilia. In "", Cimbolic & Cartor (2006) noted that because of the large
share of post-pubescent male minors among cleric victims there is need to
further study the differential variables related to ephebophilia (sexual
interest in mid-to-late adolescents, generally ages 15 to 19) versus pedophilia
(sexual interest in prepubescent children (generally those 13 years of age or
younger) offenders. Cartor, Cimbolic & Tallon (2008) found that 6 percent of
the cleric offenders in the John Jay Report are pedophiles, 32 percent
ephebophiles, 15 percent 11 & 12 year olds only (both male and female), 20
percent indiscriminate, and 27 percent mildly indiscriminate. They also found
distinct differences between the pedophile and ephebophile groups. They
reported that there may be ‚Äúanother group of offenders who are more
indiscriminate in victim choice and represent a more heterogeneous, but still a
distinct offender category‚Äù and suggested further research to determine
‚Äúspecific variables that are unique to this group and can differentiate these
offenders from pedophile and ephebophile offenders‚Äù so as to improve the
identification and treatment of both offenders and victims. All victims in the
John Jay report were minors. The Causes and Context Study of the John Jay
College considered 22% of all victims as pre-pubescent (defined as ten years or
younger). According to definitions of the American Psychiatric Association, the
majority of the victims has to be considered pre-pubescent (age 13 or younger).
Gay priests and homosexuality. According to the John-Jay-Report 80.9% of the
alleged abuse victims in the United States were male. This led to William
Donohue of the Catholic League to opine: "I maintain it has been a homosexual
crisis all along." This was judged as an ‚Äúunwarranted assumption‚Äù, Margaret
Smith, a John Jay College criminologist who worked on the report, replied:
‚ÄúThe majority of the abusive acts were homosexual in nature. That
participation in homosexual acts is not the same as sexual identity as a gay
man.‚Äù Research on pedophilia in general shows a majority of abusers identify
themselves as heterosexual. The Causes and Context Study of the John Jay
Institute found no statistical support for linking homosexual identity and
sexual abuse of minors. Additionally "The New York Times" reported "the abuse
decreased as more gay priests began serving the church." Clerical celibacy.
Opinion seems divided on whether there is any definite link or connection
between the Roman Catholic institution of celibacy and incidences of child
abuse by Catholic clergy. A 2005 article in the conservative Irish weekly the
"Western People" proposed that clerical celibacy contributed to the abuse
problem by suggesting that the institution of celibacy has created a "morally
superior" status that is easily misapplied by abusive priests: "The Irish
Church‚Äôs prospect of a recovery is zero for as long as bishops continue
blindly to toe the Vatican line of Pope Benedict XVI that a male celibate
priesthood is morally superior to other sections of society." Christoph
Sch√∂nborn and Hans Kung have also said that priestly celibacy could be one of
the causes of the sex abuse scandals within the Catholic Church. Ernie Allen,
president of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, said, "We
don't see the Catholic Church as a hotbed of this or a place that has a bigger
problem than anyone else. I can tell you without hesitation that we have seen
cases in many religious settings, from traveling evangelists to mainstream
ministers to rabbis and others." Philip Jenkins, a long-time Catholic turned
Episcopalian, asserts that his "research of cases over the past 20 years
indicates no evidence whatever that Catholic or other celibate clergy are any
more likely to be involved in misconduct or abuse than clergy of any other
denomination‚Äîor indeed, than non-clergy. However determined news media may be
to see this affair as a crisis of celibacy, the charge is just unsupported."
Male culture of the church. Italian academic Lucetta Scaraffia wrote in
"L'Osservatore Romano" that a greater presence of women in the Vatican could
have prevented clerical sexual abuse from taking place. Priest shortage. It has
been argued that shortage of priests caused the Roman Catholic hierarchy to act
in such a way to preserve the number of clergy and ensure that sufficient
numbers were available to serve the congregation despite serious allegations
that these priests were unfit for duty. Others disagree and assert that the
Church hierarchy's mishandling of the sex abuse cases merely reflected their
prevailing attitude at the time towards any illegal or immoral activity by
clergy. Declining standards in prevailing culture. In "The Courage To Be
Catholic: Crisis, Reform, and the Future of the Church", author George Weigel
claims that it was the infidelity to orthodox Roman Catholic teaching, the
"culture of dissent" of priests, women religious, bishops, theologians,
catechists, Church bureaucrats, and activists who "believed that what the
Church proposed as true was actually false" was mainly responsible for this
problem. Cardinal Theodore E. McCarrick, retired Archbishop of Washington,
blamed the declining morals of the late 20th century as a cause of the high
number of sexually abusive priests. The hypothesis that a purported decline in
general moral standards was associated with an increase in abuse by clergy was
promoted by a study by John Jay College funded by the United States Conference
of Catholic Bishops. The study claimed that the liberal 1960s caused the
increase in abuse, and the conservative Reagan years led to its decline. The
study was branded the 'Woodstock Defence' by critics who said that the study's
own figures showed a surge in abuse reported from the 1950s, and the passage of
time meant that reports of abuse from earlier decades were unlikely. Popular
culture. Many popular culture representations have been made of the sex abuse
of children cases. Some are first person like "Sex crimes and the Vatican"
(2006) is a documentary film by Colm O'Gorman, who was raped by a Catholic
priest in the diocese of Ferns in County Wexford in Ireland when he was 14
years old. Publications. A number of books have been written about the abuse
suffered from priests and nuns, including Andrew Madden's "Altar Boy: A Story
of Life After Abuse", Carolyn Lehman's "Strong at the Heart: How it Feels to
Heal from Sexual Abuse", Larry Kelly's "The Pigeon House" which deals with
abuse in the Pigeon House TB Sanatorium at Ringsend, and Kathy O'Beirne's
bestseller "Kathy's Story" which details physical and sexual abuse suffered in
a Magdalene laundry in Ireland. Writing in the "Daily Telegraph", Ed West has
asserted that Kathy Beirne's story is "largely invented" according to "Kathy's
Real Story", a book by Hermann Kelly, a Derry born journalist on the "Irish
Daily Mail" and former editor of "The Irish Catholic". Films. The Magdalene
laundries caught the public's attention in the late 1990s as claims of
widespread abuse from some former inmates gathered momentum and were made the
subject a controversial film called "The Magdalene Sisters" (2002). In 2006, a
documentary called "Deliver Us From Evil" was made about sexual abuse and
primarily focused on one priest and his crimes; it also showed the lengths the
Catholic Church would go to in order to cover up the many reports of sexual
abuse. A daily updated list of films and documentaries is available at the
"Literature List Clergy Sexual Abuse" composed by journalist and author Roel
Verschueren. Music. In 2003, the band Epica released the song "Cry for the
Moon" on the album "The Phantom Agony" (it was released as a single the next
year), based on the sex abuse scandals of the Catholic Church. This song is
part of their anti-religion series, "The Embrace That Smothers". "Altered Boy"
on Exodus's album, "Shovel Headed Kill Machine" (2005), speaks against sexual
abuse in the Catholic Church. The abuse inspired Billy Talent to write their
song "Devil in a Midnight Mass" (first released in 2005). Also in 2005, Limp
Bizkit released the album "The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1)", which focuses on
dark lyrical subject matter, including Catholic sex abuse cases, terrorism and
fame. In 2007, Apocalyptica first released "I'm Not Jesus", featuring singer
Corey Taylor, which is a song about a former victim of Catholic sex abuse.
Television. The popular television show South Park parodied the scandal in
2002, with an episode entitled "Red Hot Catholic Love". The local priest in
South Park tries to stop priests around the world from having sex with young
boys, but they all fail to see the problem and instead of fixing it, try to
come up with ways of not getting caught.
