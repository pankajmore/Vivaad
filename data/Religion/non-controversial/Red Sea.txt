Red Sea The Red Sea is a seawater inlet of the Indian Ocean, lying between
Africa and Asia. The connection to the ocean is in the south through the Bab el
Mandeb strait and the Gulf of Aden. In the north, there is the Sinai Peninsula,
the Gulf of Aqaba, and the Gulf of Suez (leading to the Suez Canal). The Red
Sea is a Global 200 ecoregion. The sea is underlain by the Red Sea Rift which
is part of the Great Rift Valley. The Red Sea has a surface area of roughly
438,000Â kmÂ² (169,100Â miÂ²). It is about 2250Â km (1398Â mi) long and, at its
widest point, 355Â km (220.6Â mi) wide. It has a maximum depth of 2211Â m
(7254Â ft) in the central median trench, and an average depth of 490Â m
(1,608Â ft). However, there are also extensive shallow shelves, noted for their
marine life and corals. The sea is the habitat of over 1,000 invertebrate
species, and 200 soft and hard corals. It is the world's northernmost tropical
sea. Extent. and Aqaba line running from RÃ s al Fasma Southwesterly to Requin

direct translation of the Greek "Erythra Thalassa" () and Latin "Mare Rubrum"
(alternatively "Sinus Arabicus", literally "Arabian Gulf"), Arabic (Ø§Ù„Ø¨Ø­Ø±
Ø§Ù„Ø£Ø­Ù…Ø±) or (Ø¨Ø­Ø± Ø§Ù„Ù‚Ù„Ø²Ù…), Somali "Badda Cas" and Tigrinya
(á‰€á‹­áˆ• á‰£áˆ•áˆª). The name of the sea may signify the seasonal blooms of
the red-coloured "Trichodesmium erythraeum" near the water's surface. A theory
favored by some modern scholars is that the name "red" is referring to the
direction South, just as the Black Sea's name may refer to North. The basis of
this theory is that some Asiatic languages used color words to refer to the
cardinal directions. Herodotus on one occasion uses Red Sea and Southern Sea
interchangeably. Some ancient geographers called the Red Sea the Arabian Gulf
or Gulf of Arabia. The association of the Red Sea with the Biblical account of
the Israelite Crossing the Red Sea is ancient, and was made explicit in the
Septuagint translation of the Book of Exodus from Hebrew to Koine Greek in
approximately the third century B.C. In that version, the Hebrew "Yam Suph"
(×™× ×¡×•×£) is translated as "Erythra Thalassa" (Red Sea). (See also the more
recent suggestion that the "Yam Suph" of the Exodus refers to a Sea of Reeds).
The Red Sea is one of four seas named in English after common color terms â€”
the others being the Black Sea, the White Sea and the Yellow Sea. The direct
rendition of the Greek "Erythra thalassa" in Latin as Mare Erythraeum refers to
the north-western part of the Indian Ocean, and also to a region on Mars.
History. The earliest known exploration of the Red Sea was conducted by Ancient
Egyptians, as they attempted to establish commercial routes to Punt. One such
expedition took place around 2500 BC, and another around 1500 BC ( by
Hatshepsut ). Both involved long voyages down the Red Sea. The Biblical Book of
Exodus tells the story of the Israelites' miraculous crossing of a body of
water, which the Hebrew text calls "Yam Suph". Yam Suph is traditionally
identified as the Red Sea. The account is part of the Israelites' escape from
slavery in Egypt. "Yam Suph" can also been translated as Sea of Reeds. In the
6th century BC, Darius the Great of Persia sent reconnaissance missions to the
Red Sea, improving and extending navigation by locating many hazardous rocks
and currents. A canal was built between the Nile and the northern end of the
Red Sea at Suez. In the late 4th century BC, Alexander the Great sent Greek
naval expeditions down the Red Sea to the Indian Ocean. Greek navigators
continued to explore and compile data on the Red Sea. Agatharchides collected
information about the sea in the 2nd century BC. The "Periplus of the
Erythraean Sea" ("Periplus of the Red Sea"), a Greek periplus written by an
unknown author around the 1st century AD, contain a detailed description of the
Red Sea's ports and sea routes. The Periplus also describes how Hippalus first
discovered the direct route from the Red Sea to India. The Red Sea was favored
for Roman trade with India starting with the reign of Augustus, when the Roman
Empire gained control over the Mediterranean, Egypt, and the northern Red Sea.
The route had been used by previous states but grew in the volume of traffic
under the Romans. From Indian ports goods from China were introduced to the
Roman world. Contact between Rome and China depended on the Red Sea, but the
route was broken by the Aksumite Empire around the 3rd century AD. During the
Middle Ages, the Red Sea was an important part of the Spice trade route. In
1513, trying to secure that channel to Portugal, Afonso de Albuquerque laid
siege to Aden. but was forced to retreat. They cruised the Red Sea inside the
Bab al-Mandab, as the first European fleet to have sailed this waters. In 1798,
France ordered General Bonaparte to invade Egypt and take control of the Red
Sea. Although he failed in his mission, the engineer Jean-Baptiste LepÃ¨re, who
took part in it, revitalised the plan for a canal which had been envisaged
during the reign of the Pharaohs. Several canals were built in ancient times
from the Nile to the Red Sea along or near the line of the present Sweet Water
Canal, but none lasted for long. The Suez Canal was opened in November 1869. At
the time, the British, French, and Italians shared the trading posts. The posts
were gradually dismantled following the First World War. After the Second World
War, the Americans and Soviets exerted their influence whilst the volume of oil
tanker traffic intensified. However, the Six Day War culminated in the closure
of the Suez Canal from 1967 to 1975. Today, in spite of patrols by the major
maritime fleets in the waters of the Red Sea, the Suez Canal has never
recovered its supremacy over the Cape route, which is believed to be less
vulnerable. Oceanography. The Red Sea lies between arid land, desert and semi-
desert. The main reasons for the better development of reef systems along the
Red Sea is because of its greater depths and an efficient water circulation
pattern, The Red Sea water mass exchanges its water with the Arabian Sea,
Indian Ocean via the Gulf of Aden. These physical factors reduce the effect of
high salinity caused by evaporation water in the north and relatively hot water
in the south. The climate of the Red Sea is the result of two distinct monsoon
seasons; a northeasterly monsoon and a southwesterly monsoon. Monsoon winds
occur because of the differential heating between the land surface and sea.
Very high surface temperatures coupled with high salinities makes this one of
the hottest and saltiest bodies of seawater in the world. The average surface
water temperature of the Red Sea during the summer is about in the north and in
the south, with only about 2Â Â°C (3.6Â Â°F) variation during the winter
months. The overall average water temperature is . Today surface water
temperatures remain relatively constant at 21â€“25Â Â°C (70â€“77Â Â°F).
Temperature and visibility remain good to around 200Â m (656Â ft). The sea is
known for its strong winds and unpredictable local currents. The rainfall over
the Red Sea and its coasts is extremely low, averaging per year. The rain is
mostly in the form of showers of short spells, often associated with
thunderstorms and occasionally with dust storms. The scarcity of rainfall and
no major source of fresh water to the Red Sea result in the excess evaporation
as high as per year and high salinity with minimal seasonal variation. A recent
underwater expedition to the Red Sea offshore from Sudan and Eritrea found
surface water temperatures 28Â Â°C in winter and up to 34Â Â°C in the summer,
but despite that extreme heat the coral was healthy with much fish life with
very little sign of coral bleaching, with only 9% infected by thalassomonas
loyana, the 'white plague' agent. "Favia favus" coral there harbours a virus,
BA3, which kills T.loyana. Plans are afoot to use samples of these corals'
apparently heat-adapted commensal algae to salvage bleached coral elsewhere.
Salinity. The Red Sea is one of the most saline bodies of water in the world,
owing to high evaporation. Salinity ranges from between ~36Â â€° in the
southern part because of the effect of the Gulf of Aden water and reaches
41Â â€° in the northern part, owing mainly to the Gulf of Suez water and the
high evaporation. The average salinity is 40Â â€°. (Average salinity for the
world's seawater is ~35Â â€° on the Practical Salinity Scale, or PPS; that
translates to 3.5% actual dissolved salts.) Tidal range. In general tide ranges
between in the north, near the mouth of the Gulf of Suez and in the south near
the Gulf of Aden but it fluctuates between and away from the nodal point. The
central Red Sea (Jeddah area) is therefore almost tideless, and as such the
annual water level changes are more significant. Because of the small tidal
range the water during high tide inundates the coastal sabkhas as a thin sheet
of water up to a few hundred metres rather than inundating the sabkhas through
a network of channels. However, south of Jeddah in the Shoiaba area the water
from the lagoon may cover the adjoining sabkhas as far as whereas, north of
Jeddah in the Al-kharrar area the sabkhas are covered by a thin sheet of water
as far as . The prevailing north and northeastern winds influence the movement
of water in the coastal inlets to the adjacent sabkhas, especially during
storms. Winter mean sea level is higher than in summer. Tidal velocities
passing through constrictions caused by reefs, sand bars and low islands
commonly exceed 1â€“2Â m/s (3â€“6.5Â ft/s). Coral reefs in the Red Sea are near
Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Israel and Sudan. Current. In the Red Sea detailed current
data is lacking, partially because they are weak and variable both spatially
and temporally. Temporal and spatial currents variation is as low as and are
governed all by wind. During the summer, NW winds drive surface water south for
about four months at a velocity of 15â€“20Â cm/s (6â€“8Â in/s), whereas in
winter the flow is reversed resulting in the inflow of water from the Gulf of
Aden into the Red Sea. The net value of the latter predominates, resulting in
an overall drift to the northern end of the Red Sea. Generally, the velocity of
the tidal current is between 50â€“60Â cm/s (20â€“23.6Â in/s) with a maximum of
at the mouth of the al-Kharrar Lagoon. However, the range of the north-
northeast current along the Saudi coast is 8â€“29Â cm/s (3â€“11.4Â in/s). Wind
regime. With the exception of the northern part of the Red Sea, which is
dominated by persistent north-west winds, with speeds ranging between and , the
rest of the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden are subjected to the influence of
regular and seasonally reversible winds. The wind regime is characterized by
both seasonal and regional variations in speed and direction with average speed
generally increasing northward. Wind is the driving force in the Red Sea for
transporting the material either as suspension or as bedload. Wind induced
currents play an important role in the Red Sea in initiating the process of
resuspension of bottom sediments and transfer of materials from sites of
dumping to sites of burial in quiescent environment of deposition. Wind
generated current measurement is therefore important in order to determine the
sediment dispersal pattern and its role in the erosion and accretion of the
coastal rock exposure and the submerged coral beds. Geology. The Red Sea was
formed by Arabia being split from Africa by movement of the Red Sea Rift. This
split started in the Eocene and accelerated during the Oligocene. The sea is
still widening, and it is considered that it will become an ocean in time (as
proposed in the model of John Tuzo Wilson). In 1949, a deep water survey
reported anomalously hot brines in the central portion of the Red Sea. Later
work in the 1960s confirmed the presence of hot, 60Â Â°C (140Â Â°F), saline
brines and associated metalliferous muds. The hot solutions were emanating from
an active subseafloor rift. The high salinity of the waters was not hospitable
to living organisms. A number of volcanic islands rise from the center of the
sea. Most are dormant, but in 2007 Jabal al-Tair island, in the Bab el Mandeb
strait, erupted violently. An eruption among the nearby Zubair islands followed
in 2011. Living resources. The Red Sea is a rich and diverse ecosystem. More
than 1200 species of fish have been recorded in the Red Sea, and around 10% of
these are found nowhere else. This also includes 42 species of deepwater fish.
The rich diversity is in part due to the of coral reef extending along its
coastline; these fringing reefs are 5000â€“7000 years old and are largely
formed of stony acropora and porites corals. The reefs form platforms and
sometimes lagoons along the coast and occasional other features such as
cylinders (such as the Blue Hole (Red Sea) at Dahab). These coastal reefs are
also visited by pelagic species of red sea fish, including some of the 44
species of shark. The Red Sea also contains many offshore reefs including
several true atolls. Many of the unusual offshore reef formations defy classic
(i.e., Darwinian) coral reef classification schemes, and are generally
attributed to the high levels of tectonic activity that characterize the area.
The special biodiversity of the area is recognized by the Egyptian government,
who set up the Ras Mohammed National Park in 1983. The rules and regulations
governing this area protect local marine life, which has become a major draw
for diving enthusiasts. Divers and snorkellers should be aware that although
most Red Sea species are innocuous, a few are hazardous to humans: see Red Sea
species hazardous to humans. Other marine habitats include sea grass beds, salt
pans, mangroves and salt marshes. Desalination plants. There is extensive
demand of desalinated water to meet the requirement of the population and the
industries along the Red Sea. There are at least 18 desalination plants along
the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia which discharge warm brine and treatment
chemicals (chlorine and anti-scalants) that may cause bleaching and mortality
of corals and diseases to the fish stocks. Although this is only a localized
phenomenon, it may intensify with time and have a profound impact on the
fishing industry. The water from the Red Sea is also utilized by oil refineries
and cement factories for cooling purposes. Used water drained back into the
coastal zones may cause harm to the nearshore environment of the Red Sea.
Security. The Red Sea is part of the sea roads between Europe, the Persian Gulf
and East Asia, and as such has heavy shipping traffic. Piracy in Somalia occurs
principally near the area of the Gulf of Aden south of the sea. Government-
related bodies with responsibility to police the Red Sea area include the Port
Said Port Authority, Suez Canal Authority and Red Sea Ports Authority of Egypt,
Jordan Maritime Authority, Israel Port Authority, Saudi Ports Authority and Sea
Ports Corporation of Sudan. Tourism. The sea is known for its spectacular
recreational diving sites, such as Ras Mohammed, SS Thistlegorm (shipwreck),
Elphinstone, The Brothers, Dolphin Reef and Rocky Island in Egypt and less
known sites in Sudan such as Sanganeb, Abington, Angarosh and Shaab Rumi. The
Red Sea became a sought-after diving destination after the expeditions of Hans
Hass in the 1950s, and later by Jacques-Yves Cousteau. Popular tourist resorts
include El Gouna, Hurghada, Safaga, Marsa Alam, on the western shore of the Red
Sea, and Sharm-El-Sheikh, Dahab, and Taba on the Egyptian side of SinaÃ¯, as
well as Aqaba in Jordan and Eilat in Israel in an area known as the Red Sea
Riviera. The popular tourist beach of Sharm el-Sheikh was closed to all
swimming in December 2010 due to several serious shark attacks, including one
fatality. As of December 2010, scientists are investigating the attacks and
have identified, but not verified, several possible causes including over-
fishing which causes large sharks to hunt closer to shore, tourist boat
operators who chum offshore for shark-photo opportunities, and reports of ships
throwing dead livestock overboard. The sea's narrow width, significant depth,
and sharp drop-offs, all combine to form a geography where large deep-water
sharks can roam in hundreds of meters of water, yet be within a hundred meters
of swimming areas. Bordering countries. The Gulf of Suez is entirely bordered
by Egypt. The Gulf of Aqaba borders Egypt, Israel, Jordan and Saudi Arabia. In
addition to the standard geographical definition of the six countries bordering
the Red Sea cited above, areas such as Somalia and Ethiopia are sometimes also
described as Red Sea territories. This is primarily due to their proximity to
and geological similarities with the nations facing the Red Sea and/or
political ties with said areas.
