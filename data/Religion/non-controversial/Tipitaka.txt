Tripiá¹­aka is a traditional term used by various Buddhist sects to describe
their various canons of scriptures. As the name suggests, a traditionally
contains three "baskets" of teachings: a (Sanskrit; Pali: "Sutta Pitaka"), a '
(Sanskrit & Pali) and an ' (Sanskrit; Pali: "Abhidhamma Piá¹­aka"). The three
categories. Tripitaka is the three main categories of texts that make up the
Buddhist canon. Sutras. These are mainly teachings and sermons of Buddha
originally transcribed in Sanskrit or Pali. They may contain descriptions of
Buddha and parables which may help lead to enlightenment of the reader.
Abhidharma. Philosophical and psychological discourse and interpretation of
Buddhist doctrine. Vinaya. Rules and regulation of monastic life that range
from dress code and dietary rules to prohibition in personal conduct. In Indian
Buddhist schools. Each of the Early Buddhist Schools likely had their own
recensions of the Tripiá¹­aka. According to some sources, there were some
Indian schools of Buddhism that had five or seven piá¹­akas. MahÄsÄá¹ƒghika.
The MahÄsÄá¹ƒghika Vinaya was translated by Buddhabhadra and Faxian in 416
CE, and is preserved in Chinese translation (TaishÅ Tripiá¹­aka 1425). The 6th
century CE Indian monk ParamÄrtha wrote that 200 years after the
parinirvÄá¹‡a of the Buddha, much of the MahÄsÄá¹ƒghika school moved north
of RÄjagá¹›ha, and were divided over whether the MahÄyÄna teachings should
be incorporated formally into their Tripiá¹­aka. According to this account,
they split into three groups based upon the relative manner and degree to which
they accepted the authority of these MahÄyÄna texts. ParamÄrtha states that
the Gokulika sect did not accept the MahÄyÄna sÅ«tras as "buddhavacana"
("words of the Buddha"), while the LokottaravÄda sect and the EkavyÄvahÄrika
sect did accept the MahÄyÄna sÅ«tras as "buddhavacana". Also in the 6th
century CE, Avalokitavrata writes of the MahÄsÄá¹ƒghikas using a "Great
Ä€gama Piá¹­aka," which is then associated with MahÄyÄna sÅ«tras such as the
"PrajÃ±ÄparamitÄ" and the "DaÅ›abhÅ«mika SÅ«tra". Caitika. The Caitikas
included a number of sub-sects including the PÅ«rvaÅ›ailas, AparaÅ›ailas,
SiddhÄrthikas, and RÄjagirikas. In the 6th century CE, Avalokitavrata writes
that MahÄyÄna sÅ«tras such as the "PrajÃ±ÄparamitÄ" and others are chanted
by the AparaÅ›ailas and the PÅ«rvaÅ›ailas. Also in the 6th century CE,
BhÄvaviveka speaks of the SiddhÄrthikas using a VidyÄdhÄra Piá¹­aka, and
the PÅ«rvaÅ›ailas and AparaÅ›ailas both using a Bodhisattva Piá¹­aka, implying
collections of MahÄyÄna texts within these Caitika schools. BahuÅ›rutÄ«ya.
The BahuÅ›rutÄ«ya school is said to have included a Bodhisattva Piá¹­aka in
their canon. The ', also called the ', is an extant abhidharma from the
BahuÅ›rutÄ«ya school. This abhidharma was translated into Chinese in sixteen
fascicles (TaishÅ Tripiá¹­aka 1646). Its authorship is attributed to
Harivarman, a third-century monk from central India. ParamÄrtha cites this
BahuÅ›rutÄ«ya abhidharma as containing a combination of HÄ«nayÄna and
MahÄyÄna doctrines, and Joseph Walser agrees that this assessment is correct.
SÄrvÄstivÄda. Scholars at present have "a nearly complete collection of
sÅ«tras from the SarvÄstivÄda school" thanks to a recent discovery in
Afghanistan of roughly two-thirds of DÄ«rgha Ä€gama in Sanskrit. The Madhyama
Ä€gama (TaishÅ Tripiá¹­aka 26) was translated by Gautama Saá¹ƒghadeva, and is
available in Chinese. The Saá¹ƒyukta Ä€gama (TaishÅ Tripiá¹­aka 99) was
translated by Guá¹‡abhadra, also available in Chinese translation. The
SarvÄstivÄda is therefore the only early school besides the Theravada for
which we have a roughly complete SÅ«tra Piá¹­aka. The SÄrvÄstivÄda Vinaya
Piá¹­aka is also extant in Chinese translation, as are the seven books of the
SarvÄstivÄda Abhidharma Piá¹­aka. There is also the encyclopedic "Abhidharma
MahÄvibhÄá¹£a ÅšÄstra" (TaishÅ Tripiá¹­aka 1545), which was held as
canonical by the VaibhÄá¹£ika SarvÄstivÄdins of northwest India.
MÅ«lasÄrvÄstivÄda. Portions of the MÅ«lasÄrvÄstivÄda Tripiá¹­aka survive
in Tibetan translation and Nepalese manuscripts. The relationship of the
MÅ«lasÄrvÄstivÄda school to SarvÄstivÄda school is indeterminate; their
vinayas certainly differed but it is not clear that their SÅ«tra Piá¹­aka did.
The Gilgit manuscripts may contain Ä€gamas from the MÅ«lasÄrvÄstivÄda school
in Sanskrit. The MÅ«lasÄrvÄstivÄda Vinaya Piá¹­aka survives in Tibetan
translation. The Gilgit manuscripts also contain vinaya texts from the
MÅ«lasÄrvÄstivÄda school in Sanskrit. Dharmaguptaka. A complete version of
the DÄ«rgha Ä€gama (TaishÅ Tripiá¹­aka 1) of the Dharmaguptaka school was
translated into Chinese by BuddhayaÅ›as and Zhu Fonian (ç«ºä½›å¿µ) in the Later
Qin dynasty, dated to 413 CE. It contains 30 sÅ«tras in contrast to the 34
suttas of the Theravadin DÄ«gha NikÄya. A.K. Warder also associates the extant
Ekottara Ä€gama (TaishÅ Tripiá¹­aka 125) with the Dharmaguptaka school, due to
the number of rules for monks and nuns, which corresponds to the Dharmaguptaka
Vinaya. The Dharmaguptaka Vinaya is also extant in Chinese translation (TaishÅ
Tripiá¹­aka 1428), and Buddhist monks and nuns in East Asia adhere to the
Dharmaguptaka Vinaya. The Dharmaguptaka Tripiá¹­aka is said to have contained a
total of five piá¹­akas. These included a Bodhisattva Piá¹­aka and a Mantra
Piá¹­aka (Ch. å’’è—), also sometimes called a DhÄraá¹‡Ä« Piá¹­aka. According
to the 5th century Dharmaguptaka monk BuddhayaÅ›as, the translator of the
Dharmaguptaka Vinaya into Chinese, the Dharmaguptaka school had assimilated the
MahÄyÄna Tripiá¹­aka (Ch. å¤§ä¹˜ä¸‰è—). MahÄ«Å›Äsaka. The MahÄ«Å›Äsaka
Vinaya is preserved in Chinese translation (TaishÅ Tripiá¹­aka 1421),
translated by BuddhajÄ«va and Zhu Daosheng in 424 CE. KÄÅ›yapÄ«ya. Small
portions of the of the KÄÅ›yapÄ«ya school survive in Chinese translation. An
incomplete Chinese translation of the Saá¹ƒyukta Ä€gama of the KÄÅ›yapÄ«ya
school by an unknown translator circa the Three Qin (ä¸‰ç§¦) period (352-431
CE) survives. In the Theravada school. The complete Tripiá¹­aka set of the
TheravÄda school is written and preserved in Pali in the Pali Canon. Buddhists
of the TheravÄda school use the Pali variant "Tipitaka" to refer what is
commonly known in English as the Pali Canon. Use of the term in Indo-Tibetan
and East Asian MahÄyÄna. The term had tended to become synonymous with
Buddhist scriptures, and thus continued to be used for the Chinese and Tibetan
collections, although their general divisions do not match a strict division
into three piá¹­akas. In the Chinese tradition, the texts are classified in a
variety of ways, most of which have in fact four or even more piá¹­akas or
other divisions. The Chinese form of , "sÄnzÃ ng" (ä¸‰è—), was sometimes used
as an honorary title for a Buddhist monk who has mastered the teachings of the
Tripiá¹­aka. In Chinese culture this is notable in the case of the Tang Dynasty
monk Xuanzang, whose pilgrimage to India to study and bring Buddhist text back
to China was portrayed in the novel "Journey to the West" as "Tang Sanzang"
(Tang Dynasty Tripiá¹­aka Master). Due to the popularity of the novel, the term
"sÄnzÃ ng" is often erroneously understood as a name of the monk Xuanzang. One
such screen version of this is the popular 1979 Monkey (TV series). The modern
Indian scholar Rahul Sankrityayan is sometimes referred to as "Tripitakacharya"
in reflection of his familiarity with the . External links. Tripitaka
