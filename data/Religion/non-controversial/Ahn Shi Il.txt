Unification Church The Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World
Christianity is a new religious movement founded in South Korea in 1954 by the
late Sun Myung Moon. It is more commonly known as the Unification Church. Since
its inception, the church has expanded to most nations of the world, with an
uncertain number of members. Unification Church beliefs are based on the Bible
and are explained in the church's textbook, "Divine Principle". The Blessing
ceremony of the Unification Church, a wedding or marriage rededication
ceremony, is a church practice which has attracted wide public attention. The
Unification Church has engaged in interfaith activities with other religions,
including mainstream Christianity and Islam, despite theological differences.
The Unification Church has sponsored many organizations and projects over the
years; including businesses, news media, projects in education and the arts,
and political and social activism. It has a large 'megachurch' in Seoul, Korea
and Peace Island in Liberia, which is the site of the New Hope Academy. The
church was led by Moon until his death on September 3, 2012, at which time, it
was reported that his wife Hak Ja Han and their sons Hyung Jin Moon and Kook
Jin Moon would assume the leadership of the church. History. Origins in Korea.
Unification Church members believe that Jesus appeared to Mun Yong-myong (his
birth name) when Moon was 15 on April 17, 1935, and asked him to accomplish the
work left unfinished after his crucifixion. After a period of prayer and
consideration, Moon accepted the mission, later changing his name to Mun Son-
myong (Sun Myung Moon). The church's official teachings, the "Divine
Principle," was first published as "Wolli Wonbon" in 1946. The second, expanded
version, "Wolli Hesol", or "Explanation of the Divine Principle", was not
published until 1957. Sun Myung Moon preached in northern Korea after the end
of World War II and in 1946 was imprisoned by the communist regime in North
Korea. He was released from prison, along with many other North Koreans, by the
advance of American and United Nations forces during the Korean War. He built
his first church from mud and cardboard boxes as a refugee in Pusan. Moon
formally founded the church in Seoul on May 1, 1954, calling it "The Holy
Spirit(ual) Association for the Unification of World Christianity." The name
alluded to Moon's stated intention for his organization to be a unifying force
for all Christian denominations. The phrase "Holy Spirit Association" has the
sense in the original Korean of "Heavenly Spirits" and not the "Holy Spirit" of
Christianity. "Unification" has political as well as religious connotations, in
keeping with the church's teaching that restoration must be complete, both
spiritual and physical. The church expanded rapidly in South Korea and by the
end of 1955 had 30 church centers throughout the nation. International
expansion. In 1958 Moon sent missionaries to Japan, and in 1959, to America.
Moon moved to the United States in 1971, (although he remained a citizen of the
Republic of Korea). Missionary work took place in Washington, D.C., New York,
and California. UC missionaries found success in the San Francisco Bay Area,
where the church expanded in Oakland, Berkeley, and San Francisco. By 1971 the
Unification Church of the United States had about 500 members. By 1973 the
church had some presence in all 50 states and a few thousand members. In 1960s,
Unification Church became well known and "high-profile" religious group, as
Journal of American Folklore defined it. The church also sent missionaries to
Europe. The church entered Czechoslovakia in 1968 and remained underground
until the 1990s. In 1975, Moon sent out missionaries to 120 countries to spread
the Unification Church around the world and also in part, he said, to act as
"lightning rods" to receive "persecution." Unification Church activity in South
America began in the 1970s with missionary work. Later the church made large
investments in civic organizations and business projects, including an
international newspaper. In the 1970s Moon gave a series of public speeches in
the United States, including one in Madison Square Garden in New York City in
1974 and two in 1976: in Yankee Stadium in New York City, and on the grounds of
the Washington Monument in Washington, D.C., where Moon spoke on "God's Hope
for America" to 300,000 people. In 1975 Unification Church held one of the
largest peaceful gatherings in history, with 1.2 million people in Yoido, South
Korea. In 1976 the Unification Church's made its headquarters in New York in
the New Yorker Hotel, a 40-story Art Deco building, as well as the one of the
first skyscrapers in the world. The expansion of membership led to accusations
of "brainwashing", which were dismissed later. Instead, members of Unification
Church have reported of being forcefully brainwashed, or "deprogrammed", by
interested parties. In 1977, Unification Church won the lawsuit in USA against
deprogrammers . In the early 1980s recruitment practices changed and membership
declined. The church has been a frequent target of the anti-cult movement and
the Christian countercult movement which, as a sociologist and the founder of
INFORM (Information Network Focus on Religious Movements) Eileen Barker
described them, "had started as gatherings of concerned relatives but developed
into powerful lobbying groups that accumulated all the worrying stories about
any one movement , and then generalised these into a conventional wisdom" about
the activities of the Unification Church ‚Äì forgetting that all these
activities could be found in the traditional religions. In 1984 Unification
Church started a book publishing company in One Dag Hammarskjold Plaza in
Manhattan, whose editorial board included prominent scholars associated with
some of the nation's leading universities. The company is called "Paragon
House" and has a $5 million budget. In 1988, Unification Church was involved in
the October Surprise that got George H.W. Bush elected. 1990s. In 1990,
Unification Church founded its $8m Universal Ballet project, with Soviet-born
Oleg Vinogradov as its art director and Julia Moon as its prima ballerina. At
the opening ceremony, letters of congratulation from President Bush and John
Frohnmayer, chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, were read. In 1991
Moon announced that church members should return to their hometowns and
undertake apostolic work there. Massimo Introvigne, who studied the Unification
Church and other new religious movements, said that this confirmed that full-
time membership is no longer considered crucial to church members. In 1992,
Unification Church opened the "New Eden Academy International" on the campus of
the University of Bridgeport, a boarding school for children of Unification
Church members. In 1993, Unification Church members organized a seminar in the
Russian Ministry of the Interior. As of December 1994, Unification Church had
invested $150 million in Uruguay. Members own the country's largest hotel, one
of its leading banks, the second-largest newspaper and two of the largest
printing plants. Starting in the 1990s, the Unification Church expanded its
operations into Russia and other formerly communist nations. Han made a radio
broadcast to the nation from the Kremlin Palace of Congresses. As of 1994, the
church had about 5,000 members in Russia and the Russian Education Ministry was
giving the Unification Church privileged access to thousands of state schools
with their captive audiences of impressionable pupils. About 500 Russian
students had been sent to USA to participate in 40-day workshops of and by the
Unification Church. Starting in 1992 the church established business ties with
communist North Korea and owned an automobile manufacturer (Pyeonghwa Motors),
a hotel, and other properties there. In 2007 it founded a "World Peace Center"
in Pyongyang, North Korea's capital city. In 1996, the Unification Church
started a $10-million project called "Tiempos Del Mundo", a newspaper in
Spanish circulating in 16 countries of Latin America, "a newspaper for half a
Hemisphere", as "The New York Times" called it. In 1998, Unification Movement
forgave a $90 million loan to the University of Bridgeport and donated an
additional $15 million. In 1998, the Unification Movement launched its
operations in North Korea with the approval of the Government of South Korea,
which had prohibited business relationships between North and South before; and
built a church there. 21st century. Since 2000, Unification Church's Pyeonghwa
Motors has invested more than $300 million to the automobile industry of the
DPRK. In 2000, "an event of historical importance" occurred, according to a
live broadcast for the state-owned Korea Broadcasting System, as 78 North
Korean girls and boys arrived at the Unification Church's cross-cultural "ice-
breaker" event, where guests such as the minister of unification, Park Jae-Kyu,
and the minister of culture, Park Jie Won were present. In 2000, Unification
Church bought the news agency United Press International. At the United Nations
Headquarters, Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid addressed an event of the
Unification Church in collaboration with the Permanent Mission of Indonesia to
the UN. The church met with the President of the Marshall Islands Kessai Note
and discussed plans to invest US$ 1 million for construction of a new high
school. The next year, he attended Moon's birthday party. In 2003, on
notification by the Secretary-General of the United Nations Kofi Annan, about
500 Christians, Muslims, Jews and other international and interfaith tourists
joined the Unification Church Middle East Peace Initiative "to such a degree
that the Old Gates were opened by the Israeli police near the Wailing Wall, and
by the Muslim leadership at Al Aqsa, without incident", as the official UN-
report says. The Los Angeles Galaxy, which competes in Major League Soccer,
played in South Korea during Unification Church's Peace Cup. That same year,
Unification Church held the "Interreligious Peace Sports Festival" between the
people of various faiths, which is, according to the UNESCO official data, ""an
annual sporting event designed to build and promote friendship and peace among
people from different cultural and religious backgrounds using the powerful
medium of sports competition"". The college team of Sun Moon University, which
some described as the best in South Korea won the tournament. In 2004, one of
the Unification Church pastors gave the official invocation to one of the
formal events of Las Vegas chaired by the Mayor of Las Vegas. In 2005, Chun
Doo-hwan, the 12th President of the Republic of Korea, and Chung Mong-joon, the
Vice-President of FIFA, attended the opening ceremony of the Unification
Church-owned Peace Cup, along with Moon. In 2006, the President of Sri Lanka
Mahinda Rajapaksa, 4th President of Sri Lanka Dingiri Banda Wijetunga, twice
Prime Minister of Sri Lanka Ranil Wickremasinghe and the Speaker of the
Parliament of Sri Lanka W. J. M. Lokubandara were guest speakers at a UC event.
In Korea, in response to a slanderous newspaper article, more than 700 members
of the Unification Movement joined a rally and destroyed the office of the
newspaper. Later on, the newspaper wrote a rebuttal. Starting in 2007, the
church sponsored a series of public events in various nations under the title
Global Peace Festival. One such event was endorsed by Mwai Kibaki, the
President of Kenya. In 2007, Musa Bin Jaafar Bin Hassan, at the time President
of the 33rd session of the General Conference, UNESCO's supreme governing body,
was granted the title "Ambassador for Peace" by the Unification Church at the
General Conference (United Nations). In 2012, Hassan, Boutros Boutros-Ghali
(6th United Nations Secretary-General and current President of the UNESCO Panel
on Democracy and Development) gave remarks at the Unification Church event in
UNESCO's headquarters in France, along with Akiko Yamanaka (parliamentarian of
Diet of Japan, Cambridge University professor and former Deputy-Minister for
Foreign Affairs of Japan) and other 300 politicians and religious leaders. In
2007, the Unification Church completed the construction of a peace center in
Pyongyang, North Korea. Since 2008, US government has provided aid in planning,
development and coordination of the Global Peace Festival of the Unification
Church. Georgetown University students took part in it, among many. UC held
youth events in collaboration with UN-HABITAT and The Ministry of Youth Affairs
and Sports of Kenya. Year later, 5 representatives of the Unification Church
(Universal Peace Federation) attended an annual (international ministerial-
level) session of UN-HABITAT in its headquarters. In April Moon, then 88 years
old, appointed his youngest son, Hyung Jin Moon, to be the leader of the church
and movement, saying, "I hope everyone helps him so that he may fulfil his duty
as the successor of the True Parents." In 2009 Moon visited the country with
his family while his son Hyung Jin Moon was greeted by parliamentarians and
gave a speech in the British Parliament. In 2009, UN spokesmen gave speeches at
Church events. Hyung Jin Moon, now President of Unification Movement and a
Harvard alumnus, met with the 14th Dalai Lama. That same year, Moon's
autobiography, "As a Peace-Loving Global Citizen" (), was published by Gimm-
Young Publishers in South Korea. The book became a bestseller in Korea and
Japan. In 2010, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon spoke at the Unification
Church-owned Manhattan Center during Africa Day event, which was also co-
sponsored by the Unification Church. In collaboration with US government, the
church organized a summer employment program for 250 disadvantaged teens. In
2011, 48th President of Paraguay Juan Carlos Wasmosy, 49th President of
Paraguay Ra√∫l Cubas Grau, 50-th President of Paraguay Luis √Ångel Gonz√°lez
Macchi and the President of the Chamber of Deputies √ìscar Gonz√°lez Daher
participated in the Global Peace Festival of the Unification Church. The church
joined with Morehouse College to launch Martin Luther King, Jr. Middle School
Leadership Academy. Students enrolled in the Academy "complete community
projects, a health fair for the community surrounding the school as well as
other service oriented activities". The Unification Movement received the
"Lifetime Achievement Award" from Taiwanese Executive Yuan. That same year,
representatives of seven religions from South Korea visited Pyongyang, North
Korea, for the first time ever, in their joint efforts to unite the Korean
Peninsula; the delegation was headed by members of the Unification Movement. In
December in Pyongyang, to mark the 20th anniversary of Sun Myung Moon's visit
to the DPRK, de jure President Kim Yong-nam hosted the new President in the
official residence. The latter donated 600 tons of flour to North Korean
children of Jeongju Province, the birthplace of Sun Myung Moon. Also, after the
2011 earthquake in Japan, he donated $ 1.7 million to the Japanese Red Cross.
In February 2012, Stavros S. Anthony, the Mayor of Las Vegas, recognized the
contributions of Unification Church's Little Angels Children's Folk Ballet of
Korea. That year the Movement was constructing 70-storey twin skyscraper in
Seoul at an estimated cost of $2 billion USD. A Russian senator who backed the
church, invited it to hold its event in Federal Assembly of Russia. "Global
Peace Women" was launched in Malaysia, a chapter of Unification Church-
affiliated Global Peace Festival Foundation, with the wife of the Deputy Prime
Minister of Malaysia as its chair. That same year, the Head of UNEP Achim
Steiner and other UN dignataries gave remarks at an environmental event of the
affiliate in UNEP Headquarters. The event brought together about 300 people
including Keishu Shinso Ito, the highest-ranking minister in Japanese Buddhism,
along with other religious leaders. At the opening of Yeosu Expo 2012, Kook Jin
Moon, a son of Moon responsible for economic development of the movement, sat
in front of the South Korean President Lee Myung-bak among the VIP group.
Political activities. "See: Unification Church political activities" The
Unification Church has been noted for its political activities, especially its
support for United States president Richard Nixon during the Watergate scandal,
its support for anti-communism during the Cold War, and its ownership of
various news media outlets through News World Communications, an international
news media conglomerate which publishes "The Washington Times" newspaper in
Washington, D.C., and newspapers in South Korea, Japan, and South America,
which tend to support conservatism. In 1970, President Nixon sent a request to
the Korean Foreign Ministry to provide information about the Unification
Movement, and two years later he met with leaders of the movement. In 1974,
Moon took full-page ads in major newspapers defending President Richard Nixon
at the height of the Watergate controversy. The church was caught up in the
1976 Koreagate scandal which involved Korean political figures trying to
influence Democratic members in the United States Congress. A Congressional
subcommittee led by Democratic Representative Donald M. Fraser of Minnesota
described the church as being "paramilitary" and "tightly controlled." It also
found that the South Korean intelligence agency, the KCIA, had used the
Unification Church as a political tool within the United States and that some
Unification Church members worked as volunteers in Congressional offices.
Together they founded the Korean Cultural Freedom Foundation, a nonprofit
organization which acted as a propaganda campaign for the Republic of Korea.
The committee also investigated possible KCIA influence on the Unification
Church's campaign in support of Nixon. It was during this time that the church
and Rev. Moon received backing from Japanese billionaires Yoshio Kodama and
Ryoichi Sasakawa, who controlled Japanese boat racing. In 1986 CAUSA
International, a church supported anti-communist organization, sponsored the
documentary film "Nicaragua Was Our Home" about the Miskito Indians of
Nicaragua and their persecution at the hands of the Nicaraguan government. It
was filmed and produced by church member Lee Shapiro, who later died while
filming with anti-Soviet forces during the Soviet war in Afghanistan. In 1994
the "New York Times", in a review of a PBS "Frontline" documentary on the
Unification Church, said that, "outside investigators and onetime insiders ‚Ä¶
give a picture of a theocratic powerhouse that is pouring foreign fortunes into
conservative causes in the United States." In 1998 the Egyptian newspaper "Al-
Ahram" criticized Moon's "ultra-right leanings" and suggested a personal
relationship with conservative Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In
1995, the former U.S. President George H. W. Bush and his wife, Barbara Bush,
spoke at a Unification Church event in the sold-out 50,000-seat Tokyo Dome.
Tickets ranged from $80 to $120. "If as president I could have done one thing
to have helped the country more," Mr. Bush told the gathering, "it would have
been to do a better job in finding a way, either through speaking out or
through raising a moral standard, to strengthen the American family." Han, the
main speaker, credited her husband with bringing about Communism's fall and
declared that he must save America from "the destruction of the family and
moral decay." In 2003, South Korean Unification Church members started a
political party, "The Party for God, Peace, Unification, and Home." In an
inauguration declaration, the party announced its focus on preparing for the
reunification of the two Korean states by educating the public about God and
peace. A church official said that similar political parties would be started
in Japan and the United States. It operates every polling station. Moon is a
member of the Honorary Committee of the Unification Ministry of the Republic of
Korea. The church member Jae-jung Lee had been once a unification minister of
the Republic of Korea. Another, Ek Nath Dhakal, is a member of the Nepalese
Constituent Assembly, and a first Minister for Co-operatives and Poverty
Alleviation Ministry of the Government of Nepal. Beliefs. God is viewed as the
creator, whose nature combines both masculinity and femininity, and is the
source of all truth, beauty, and goodness. Human beings and the universe
reflect God's personality, nature and purpose. "Give-and-take action"
(reciprocal interaction) and "subject and object position" (initiator and
responder) are "key interpretive concepts" and the self is designed to be God's
object. The purpose of human existence is to return joy to God. The "four-
position foundation" is "another important and interpretive concept"and
explains in part the emphasis on the family. Members of the Unification Church
believe that Moon is the Messiah and claim that "history will answer whether
Moon is new messiah". Moon himself gave the following answer to the question of
whether he is the messiah or not: "Yes I am. But so are you." Then he pointed
to each person around him: "And so are you, and you, and you." Sex and
marriage. The Unification Church is well known for its wedding or marriage
rededication ceremony. It is given to married (or engaged) couples. Through it,
members of the Unification Church believe, the couple is removed from the
lineage of sinful humanity and engrafted into God's sinless lineage. The
Blessing ceremony was first held in 1961 for 36 couples in Seoul, South Korea
by the Moons shortly after their own marriage in 1960. All the couples were
members of the church. Rev. Moon matched all of the couples except 12 who were
already married to each other before joining the church. Later Blessing
ceremonies were larger in scale but followed the same pattern. All participants
were Unification Church members and Rev. Moon matched most of the couples. In
1982 the first large scale Blessing (of 2,000 couples) outside of Korea took
place in Madison Square Garden, New York City. In 1988, Moon matched 2,500
Korean members with Japanese members for a Blessing ceremony held in Korea,
partly in order to promote unity between the two nations. In 1992 Sun Myung
Moon gave the wedding blessing for 30,000 couples at the Seoul Olympic Stadium
and for 13,000 at the Yankee Stadium. In 1997, Al Sharpton, a Christian
minister and a candidate for the 2004 presidential election, who had also taken
part in other Unification Church events and holidays, took part in a blessing
ceremony at RFK Stadium, Washington, D.C., as a wedding-vow renewal with his
wife. That year, 3.6 million couples were married simultaneously in the
ceremony. In 2001, the Catholic Church archbishop Emmanuel Milingo was wed by
Moon with a Unification Church member in a blessing ceremony against the will
of the Pope. The Blessing ceremonies attracted attention in the press and in
the public imagination, often being labeled "mass weddings", the one of such
blessing ceremonies was held at Headquarters of the United Nations in 2000.
Such weddings proved to be happy, according to scientific researchs. "Whatever
anyone wants to say about the Unification Church, the marital aspect seems to
work," said Robert Epstein, a research psychologist. No-divorce rates are up to
83% in the Unification Church. Unification Church teaches that romantic love
leads to sexual promiscuity, mismatched couples and dysfunctional societies.
The Unification Movement affected the demographic map of mono-ethnic Korea due
to its Blessing Ceremony. South Korea has an acute problem of gender imbalance.
Consequently, there is a large shortage of marriageable women: more than half
of female immigrants are from the Philippines, Thailand and other countries
came to Korea due to the Unification Movement and less than 20%¬ ‚Äì through
marriage agencies. Several church-related groups are working to promote sexual
abstinence until marriage and fidelity in marriage and to prevent child
exploitation; they care for victims of Thailand's massive sex trade as well. In
1996, Unification Church gathered 3,500 signatures during its anti-porn
campaign. As a church official said, "pornography makes love seem temporal,
pure love goes beyond the sexual relationship." In 2009, a blessing ceremony
for 7,000 couples was attended by the Vice Speaker of the National Assembly of
the Republic of Korea and by the daughter of the late President Park Chung-hee.
She said: "I join in a trans-religious spirit. I like the Unification Church
way of interpreting the Bible, incorporating the Quran and Buddhist scripts".
Relations with other religions. Judaism. The relationship between the
Unification Church and Judaism has been marked by some controversy. The "Divine
Principle" has been accused of containing antisemitic references. Statements by
Moon that Jewish victims of the Holocaust were paying indemnity for the
crucifixion of Jesus have also been described as antisemitic. In the 1980s
church leaders Mose Durst, Peter Ross, and Andrew Wilson expressed regret over
some members' misunderstanding of Judaism and urged better relations with the
Jewish community. Christianity. From its beginning, the Unification Church
claimed to be Christian and promoted its teachings to mainstream Christian
churches and organizations . The Unification Church in Korea was labeled as
heretical by Protestant churches in South Korea, including Moon‚Äôs own
Presbyterian Church. In the United States the church was rejected by ecumenical
organizations as being non-Christian. The main objections were theological,
especially because of the Unification Church‚Äôs addition of material to the
Bible. In their influential book "The Kingdom of the Cults" (first published in
1965), Walter Ralston Martin and Ravi K. Zacharias disagreed with the "Divine
Principle" on the issues of the divinity of Christ, the virgin birth of Jesus,
the Unification Church's belief that Jesus should have married, the necessity
of the crucifixion of Jesus, and a literal resurrection of Jesus as well as a
literal second coming of Jesus. Christian commentators have also criticized
Unification Church teachings as contrary to the Protestant doctrine of
salvation by faith alone. Islam. The relationship between the Unification
Church and Islam has often been noted, both by scholars and the news media. The
"Divine Principle" lists the ‚ÄúIslamic cultural sphere‚Äù as one of the
world‚Äôs four major divisions (the others are the East Asian, the Hindu, and
the Christian spheres). Unification Church support for Islamist anti-communists
came to public attention in 1987 when church member Lee Shapiro was killed in
Afghanistan during the Soviet war in Afghanistan while filming a documentary.
In 1997, Louis Farrakhan, the leader of The Nation of Islam, an African
American Islamic organization, served as a "co-officiator" at a blessing
ceremony presided over by Moon and Han. In 2000 the Church and the Nation of
Islam co-sponsored the Million Family March, a rally in Washington, D.C., to
celebrate family unity and racial and religious harmony. Interfaith activities.
In 1974 Moon founded the Unification Theological Seminary, in Barrytown, New
York, partly in order to improve relations of the Unification Church with other
churches. Professors from other denominations, including a Methodist minister,
a Presbyterian, and a Roman Catholic priest, as well as a rabbi, were hired to
teach students to be leaders in the Church. Unification Church held dialogues
between the members of the Israeli Knesset and the Palestinian Parliament as
part of his Middle East Peace Initiatives. In the 1980s the Unification Church
sent thousands of American ministers from other churches on trips to Japan and
South Korea to inform them about Unification Church teachings. In 2009 the
Unification Church held an interfaith event in the Peruvian Congress. The
President of the Congress of Peru Marcial Ayaipoma In 2010, the church built a
large interfaith temple in Seoul. Author Deepak Chopra was the keynote speaker
at an interfaith event of the Unification Church co-hosted with UN at the
United Nations Headquarters. In 2011, an interfaith event was held in the
National Assembly of Thailand, the President of the National Assembly of
Thailand attended the event. In 2012, the Unification Church-affiliated
Universal Peace Federation held an interfaith dialogue in Italy, which was
cosponsored by United Nations. That year, Unification Church affiliated
Universal Peace Federation held an interfaith program for representatives of 12
various religions and confessions in the United Nations General Assembly Hall.
President of the United Nations General Assembly, Deputy Secretary-General of
the United Nations, Permanent Observer of the Holy See to the United Nations
and other UN officials gave speeches there. Structure and organization. Related
organizations. The church and its members own, operate and subsidize
organizations and projects involved in political, cultural, commercial, media,
educational and other activities. In South Korea, Unification Church manages
some 4,600 hectares of land and more than 300 residential and commercial rental
properties. Many of the companies and enterprises are profitable and help
realize church doctrine. The Unification Church in 2001 persuaded the North
Korean government to relax its restrictions and permit Pyeonghwa Motors, a
South Korean automaker with ties to the Church, to assemble cars in the DPRK
and advertise them to North Koreans. The Unification Church sought to promote
private business enterprises that would shift the North Korean economy away
from a planned economy to a market economy. The church-owned conglomerate
Tongil Group has four subsidiaries listed on the Korea Exchange. Unification
Movement is the largest supplier of U.S. sushi restaurants, supplying most of
the 9,000 units in the country. It is the second largest exporter of Korean
goods. In some U.S. areas it is the largest employer. For a while the
Unification Church was the largest foreign investor in China. It manages the
top Asian ballet company, the largest Asian helicopter plant, as well as the
only automobile-manufacturing plant in North Korea, Pyeonghwa Motors. Three of
its NGOs, namely Universal Peace Federation, Women's Federation for World Peace
and "Service for Peace", are in consultative status with the UN Economic and
Social Council. The church owns Manhattan Center during Africa Day event, which
was cosponsored by an affiliated organization. Unification Church-owned
Yeongpyeong Resort, The Ocean Resort and Pineridge Resort hosted Expo 2012 in
May 2012, and will sponsor the 2018 Winter Olympics and Formula One. and he
holds the positions of Asian Football Confederation Social Responsibility
Committee Chairman, President of K-League, President of Korea Football
Association, which is part of FIFA. Most notable Peace Cup football clubs are
Aston Villa, Juventus, Lyon, Inter Milan, etc. Economic interests of the
Unification Movement include the petrochemical industry, non-ferrous
metallurgy, automobile industry, avia carriers, yacht building, energy drinks,
banking, Hollywood, etc. The church owns a mansion in a former Gothic Catholic
Church. The church ranks third in the tourism market in Korea. It provides
tours to North Korea for separated families and built a golf course for
tourists in Pyongyang. Japanese members of the Unification Church are the
largest share of the air travel market in Korea. The movement owns hotels, an
airport, and all the necessary tourism infrastructure units. The movement
operates medical tourism; thus, CheongShim Hospital is the largest hospital in
Korea in terms of internationalization level. Scientific interests include
cancer research. The movement continues to work for the end of communism. In
2011, Unification Church's Universal Ballet spent about $10 million on a tour
of dozens of countries. In 2013 the ballet will tour with Little Angels
Children's Folk Ballet of Korea in the U.S., Canada, Japan, G-20 countries and
major cities of Russia. The tour is partially funded by the South Korean
government. In 2012, the church announced plans for a $33 million investment to
build "Isshin Hospital"-Brazil and a spa and a $12 million convention center
near McCarran International Airport. The church holds rehabilitation programs
for North Korean refugees, holds Middle East peace initiatives aimed to
reconcile Jews, Christians and Muslims and other peace initiatives. It supports
the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. The movement holds events in
the U.S., Korea, Guyana, Philippines, Thailand, India, Malaysia, Brazil,
Georgia, Bangladesh and other countries at the governmental level. One of its
youth affiliates, the Collegiate Association for the Research of Principles, is
active in Cornell University. A UPenn graduate and a member of the Unification
Church said his church "helped me achieve stellar academic results". Church
leadership. Observers of the Unification Church, as well as some church
members, had speculated about the issue of Unification Church leadership after
Moon's death. Among those sometimes mentioned were his wife Hak Ja Han, and
their sons Hyun Jin Moon, Kook Jin Moon, and Hyung Jin Moon. In 2005 Moon
appointed Kook Jin Moon chairman of Tongil Group, which represents church-owned
businesses in South Korea and other nations. In 2008 Moon appointed Hyung Jin
Moon as the international president of the church. At the same time he
appointed his daughter In Jin Moon as the president of the Unification Church
of the United States. In 2010, "Forbes" reported that Moon and Han were living
in South Korea while their children took more responsibility for the day-to-day
leadership of the Unification Church and its affiliated organizations. After
Moon's death on September 3, 2012, it was reported that Han, Hyung Jin, and
Kook Jin Moon would take over the leadership of the church.
