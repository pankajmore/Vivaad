Brahma BrahmÄ (Sanskrit: ; IAST:) is the Hindu god (deva) of creation and one
of the TrimÅ«rti, the others being Viá¹£Å†u and Åšiva. According to the BrahmÄ
PurÄÅ†a, he is the father of Manu, and from Manu all human beings are
descended. In the RÄmÄyaÅ†a and the MahÄbhÄrata, he is often referred to as
the progenitor or great grandsire of all human beings. He is not to be confused
with the Supreme Cosmic Spirit in Hindu VedÄnta philosophy known as Brahman,
which is genderless. BrahmÄ's wife is Saraswati. Saraswati is also known by
names such as SÄvitri and GÄyatri, and has taken different forms throughout
history. Saraswati is the Vedic Goddess, revered as VedamÄta, meaning Mother
of the Vedas. BrahmÄ is often identified with PrajÄpati, a Vedic deity. Being
the husband of Saraswati or Vaac Devi (the Goddess of Speech), Brahma is also
known as "Vaagish," meaning "Lord of Speech and Sound." Name. In Sanskrit

According to the PurÄÅ†as, BrahmÄ is self-born in the lotus flower. Another
legend says that BrahmÄ was born in water, or from a seed that later became
the golden egg. From this golden egg, BrahmÄ, the creator was born, as
"Hiranyagarbha". The remaining materials of this golden egg expanded into the
BrahmÄná¸a or Universe. Being born in water, BrahmÄ is also called as
"Kanja" (born in water). BrahmÄ is said also to be the son of the Supreme
Being, "BrahmÄn", and the female energy known as PrakÅ—ti. Creations. At the
beginning of the process of creation, BrahmÄ creates the four KumÄras or the
Caturá¹£aÅ†a. However, they refuse his order to procreate and instead devote
themselves to God and celibacy. He then proceeds to create from his mind ten
sons or PrajÄpatis (used in another sense), who are believed to be the fathers
of the human race. But since all these sons were born out of his mind rather
than body, they are called "MÄnas Putras" or mind-sons or spirits. The
ManusmÅ—ti and BhÄgavat PurÄÅ†a enumerate them as BrahmÄ had nine sons and
one daughter born from various parts of his body they are enumrate as Within
Vedic and PurÄÅ†ic scripture BrahmÄ is described as only occasionally
interfering in the affairs of the other devas (gods), and even more rarely in
mortal affairs. He did force Soma to give Tara back to her husband, BÅ—haspati.

others. Attributes. Appearance. He is clad in red clothes. BrahmÄ is

head, He continually recites one of the four Vedas. He is often depicted with a
white beard (especially in North India), indicating the nearly eternal nature
of his existence. Unlike most other Hindu gods, BrahmÄ holds no weapons. One
of his hands holds a scepter. Another of his hands holds a bow. BrahmÄ also
holds a string of prayer beads called the 'aká¹£amÄlÄ' (literally "garland of
eyes"), which He uses to keep track of the Universe's time. He is also shown
holding the Vedas. There are many other stories in the PurÄÅ†as about the
gradual decrease in Lord BrahmÄ's importance. Followers of Hinduism believe
that Humans cannot afford to lose the blessings of BrahmÄ and Sarasvati,
without whom the populace would lack creativity, knowledge to solve mankind's
woes. Symbols. The Four Faces â€“ The four Vedas (Å–k, SÄma, Yajuh and

four sides of the spiritual sky there is four different transcendental abodes
occupied by VÄsudeva, Sankará¹£aÅ†a, Pradyumna and Aniruddha respectively. So

VÄsudeva and this Vaikuá¹‡á¹­ha is known as Devavatipur. Above the "Satyaloka"
there is "Viá¹£Å†uloka" where Sankará¹£aÅ†a resides. In the middle of the Ocean
of Milk there is an island called Åšvetadvipa which is resided in by Aniruddha
