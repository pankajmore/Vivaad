Funeral A funeral is a ceremony for celebrating, respecting, sanctifying, or
remembering the life of a person who has died. Funerary customs comprise the
complex of beliefs and practices used by a culture to remember the dead, from
interment itself, to various monuments, prayers, and rituals undertaken in
their honor. Customs vary widely between cultures, and between religious
affiliations within cultures. The word "funeral" comes from the Latin "funus",
which had a variety of meanings, including the corpse and the funerary rites
themselves. Funerary art is art produced in connection with burials, including
many kinds of tombs, and objects specially made for burial with a corpse.
Overview. Funeral rites are as old as the human culture itself, predating
modern "Homo sapiens", to at least 300,000 years ago. For example, in the
Shanidar cave in Iraq, in Pontnewydd Cave in Wales and other sites across
Europe and the Near East, Neanderthal skeletons have been discovered with a
characteristic layer of flower pollen. This has been interpreted as suggesting
that Neanderthals believed in an afterlife, although the evidence is not
unequivocal ‚Äì while the dead were apparently indeed buried deliberately, the
flowers might have been introduced by burrowing rodents. Religious funerals.
Hindu funerals. Antyesti or Hindu funeral rites, sometimes referred as "Antim
Sanskar", is an important Sanskara, sacrament of Hindu society. Extensive texts
of such rites are available, particularly in the Garuda Purana. Islamic
funerals. Funerals in Islam (called Janazah in Arabic) follow fairly specific
rites, though they are subject to regional interpretation and variation in
custom. In all cases, however, sharia (Islamic religious law) calls for burial
of the body, preceded by a simple ritual involving bathing and shrouding the
body, followed by salah (prayer). Cremation of the body is forbidden. Sikh
funerals. In Sikhism death is considered a natural process, an event that has
absolute certainty and only happens as a direct result of God's Will or Hukam.
To a Sikh, birth and death are closely associated, because they are both part
of the cycle of human life of "coming and going" ( ‡®Ü‡®µ‡®£‡©Å ‡®ú‡®æ‡®£‡®æ,
Aana Jaana) which is seen as transient stage towards Liberation ( ‡®Æ‡©ã‡®ñ‡©Å
‡®¶‡©Å‡®Ü‡®∞‡©Å, Mokh Du-aar), complete unity with God. Sikhs thus believe in
reincarnation. However, by contrast, the soul itself is not subject to the
cycle of birth and death. Death is only the progression of the soul on its
journey from God, through the created universe and back to God again. In life,
a Sikh always tries to constantly remember death so that he or she may be
sufficiently prayerful, detached and righteous to break the cycle of birth and
death and return to God. The public display of grief at the funeral or Antam
Sanskar as it is called in the Sikh culture, such as wailing or crying out loud
is discouraged and should be kept to a minimum. Cremation is the preferred
method of disposal, although if this is not possible any other methods such as
burial or submergence at sea are acceptable. Worship of the dead with
gravestones, etc. is discouraged, because the body is considered to be only the
shell and the person's soul is their real essence. On the day of the cremation,
the body is taken to the Gurdwara or home where hymns (Shabads) from the Guru
Granth Sahib, the Sikh Scriptures are recited by the congregation, which induce
feeling of consolation and courage. Kirtan may also be performed by Ragis while
the relatives of the deceased recite "Waheguru" sitting near the coffin. This
service normally takes from 30 to 60 minutes. At the conclusion of the service,
an Ardas is said before the coffin is taken to the cremation site. At the point
of cremation, a few more Shabads may be sung and final speeches are made about
the deceased person. The eldest son or a close relative generally starts the
cremation process ‚Äì light the fire or press the button for the burning to
begin. This service usually lasts about 30 to 60 minutes. The ashes are later
collected and disposed by immersing them in the Punjab (five famous rivers in
India). Sikhs do not erect monuments over the remains of the dead. The Sidaran
Paath Hymns are sung from the scripture of the Guru Granth. The first five and
final verses of "Anand Sahib," the "Song of Bliss," are recited or sung. The
first five verses of Sikhism's morning prayer, "Japji Sahib," are read aloud to
begin the Sidharan paath. A hukam, or random verse, is read from the Guru
Granth. Ardas, a prayer, is offered. Prashad, a sacred sweet, is distributed.
Langar, a meal, is served to guests. While the Sidharan paath is being read,
the family may also sing hymns daily. Reading may take as long as needed to
complete the paath. This ceremony is followed by Sahaj Paath Bhog, Kirtan
Sohila, night time prayer is recited 1 week and finally Ardas called the "Antim
Ardas" ("Final Prayer") is offered the last week. Funerals in Japan. Religious
thought among the Japanese people is generally a blend of Shint≈ç and Buddhist
beliefs. In modern practice, specific rites concerning an individual's passage
through life are generally ascribed to one of these two faiths. Funerals and
follow-up memorial services fall under the purview of Buddhist ritual, and 90%
Japanese funerals are conducted in a Buddhist manner. Aside from the religious
aspect, a Japanese funeral usually includes a wake, the cremation of the
deceased, and inclusion within the family grave. Follow-up services are then
performed by a Buddhist priest on specific anniversaries after death. According
to one estimate made in 2005, 99.82% of all deceased Japanese are cremated. In
most of these cases, the cremated remains are placed in an urn and then
deposited in a family grave. In recent years however, alternative methods of
burial have gained in popularity; such methods include scattering of the ashes,
burial in outer space, and conversion of the cremated remains into a diamond
that can be set in jewelry. Funerals in contemporary North America and Europe.
Traditional funerals. visitation, funeral, and the burial service. Visitation.
At the "visitation" (also called a "viewing","wake" or "calling hours"), in
Christian or secular Western custom, the body of the deceased person (or
decedent) is placed on display in the casket (also called a coffin, however
almost all body containers are caskets). The viewing often takes place on one
or two evenings before the funeral. In the past, it was common practice to
place the casket in the decedent‚Äôs home or that of a relative for viewing.
This practice continues in many areas of Ireland and Scotland. The body is
traditionally dressed in the decedent's best clothes. In recent times there has
been more variation in what the decedent is dressed in ‚Äì some people choose
to be dressed in clothing more reflective of how they dressed in life. The body
will often be adorned with common jewelry, such as watches, necklaces,
brooches, etc. The jewelry may be taken off and given to the family of the
deceased or remain in the casket after burial. Jewelry will most likely be
removed before cremation. The body may or may not be embalmed, depending upon
such factors as the amount of time since the death has occurred, religious
practices, or requirements of the place of burial but in general embalming is
preferable. The most commonly prescribed aspects of this gathering are that the
attendees sign a book kept by the deceased's survivors to record who attended.
In addition, a family may choose to display photographs taken of the deceased
person during his/her life (often, formal portraits with other family members
and candid pictures to show "happy times"), prized possessions and other items
representing his/her hobbies and/or accomplishments. A more recent trend is to
create a DVD with pictures and video of the deceased, accompanied by music, and
play this DVD continuously during the visitation. The viewing is either "open
casket", in which the embalmed body of the deceased has been clothed and
treated with cosmetics for display; or "closed casket", in which the coffin is
closed. The coffin may be closed if the body was too badly damaged because of
an accident or fire or other trauma, deformed from illness or if someone in the
group is emotionally unable to cope with viewing the corpse. In cases such as
these, a picture of the deceased, usually a formal photo, is placed atop the
casket. However, this step is foreign to Judaism; Jewish funerals are held soon
after death (preferably within a day or two, unless more time is needed for
relatives to come), and the corpse is never displayed. As well, Jewish law
forbids anyone to embalm the body of the deceased. Traditionally flowers (and
music) are not sent to a grieving Jewish family as it is a reminder of the life
that is now lost.("See also Jewish bereavement.") The decedent's closest
friends and relatives who are unable to attend frequently send flowers to the
viewing, with the exception of a Jewish funeral, where flowers would not be
appropriate (and donations are given to a charity instead). The viewing
typically takes place at a funeral home, which is equipped with gathering rooms
where the viewing can be conducted, although the viewing may also take place at
a church. The viewing may end with a prayer service; in a Roman Catholic
funeral, this may include a rosary. In parts of Ireland and Scotland it is
traditional to display the body of the deceased in the family home. This is
called a wake and usually includes food, drink and sometimes music and singing.
A visitation is often held the evening before the day of the funeral. However,
when the deceased person is elderly the visitation may be held immediately
preceding the funeral. This allows elderly friends of the deceased a chance to
view the body and attend the funeral in one trip, since it may be difficult for
them to arrange travel; this step may also be taken if the deceased has few
survivors or the survivors want a funeral with only a small number of guests.
Funeral. A memorial service, often called a funeral, is often officiated by
clergy from the decedent's, or bereaved's, church or religion. A funeral may
take place at either a funeral home or church. A funeral is held according to
the family's choosing, which may be a few days after the time of death,
allowing family members to attend the service. This type of memorial service is
most common in Christians, and they call it a mass when the casket is closed
and a priest says prayers and blessings. Most of the time family members of the
dead can say something. If the funeral service takes place in the funeral home
(mostly it takes place in the funeral home's chapel) it can be directed by a
clergy or hosted by a very close family member most common a parent. In some
traditions if this service takes place in a funeral home it is the same if it
would take place in a church. These services if taking place in a funeral home
consists of a lot of prayers, blessings and eulogies from the family. The
common "open-casket service" allows mourners to have one last opportunity to
view the deceased and say good-bye. There is an order of precedence when
approaching the casket at this stage that usually starts with the immediate
family (siblings, parents, spouse, children); followed by other mourners, after
which the immediate family may file past again, so they are the last to view
their loved one before the coffin is closed. This opportunity can take place
immediately before the service begins, or at the very end of the service. The
deceased is usually transported from the funeral home to a church in a hearse,
a specialized vehicle designed to carry casketed remains. The deceased is often
transported in a procession (also called a funeral cortege), with the hearse,
funeral service vehicles, and private automobiles traveling in a procession to
the church or other location where the services will be held. In a number of
jurisdictions, special laws cover funeral processions ‚Äì such as requiring
other vehicles to give right-of-way to a funeral procession, excepting service
vehicles and ambulances. Funeral service vehicles may be equipped with light
bars and special flashers to increase their visibility on the roads. They may
also all have their headlights on, to identify which vehicles are part of the
cortege, although the practice also has roots in ancient Roman customs. After
the funeral service, if the deceased is to be buried the funeral procession
will proceed to a cemetery if not already there. If the deceased is to be
cremated, the funeral procession may then proceed to the crematorium. Funeral
services commonly include prayers, readings from a sacred text, hymns (sung
either by the attendees or a hired vocalist) and words of comfort by the
clergy. Frequently, a relative or close friend will be asked to give a eulogy,
which details happy memories and accomplishments; often commenting on the
deceased's flaws, especially at length, is considered impolite. Sometimes the
delivering of the eulogy is done by the clergy. Clergy are often asked to
deliver eulogies for people they have never met. Church bells may also be
tolled both before and after the service. In some religious denominations, for
example, Roman Catholic, Anglican and Iglesia ni Cristo (Church of Christ),
eulogies from loved ones are somewhat discouraged during this service, in order
to preserve respect for traditions. In such cases, the eulogy is only done by a
member of the clergy. This tradition is giving way to eulogies read by family
members or friends in a desire to ensure that it is done, "just right." Also,
for these same religions, the coffin is traditionally closed at the end of the
wake and is not re-opened for the funeral service. During the funeral and at
the burial service, the casket may be covered with a large arrangement of
flowers, called a casket spray. If the deceased served in a branch of the Armed
forces, the casket may be covered with a national flag; however, in the US,
nothing should cover the national flag according to Title 4, United States
Code, Chapter 1, Paragraph 8i. Funeral customs vary from country to country. In
the United States, any type of noise other than quiet whispering or mourning is
considered disrespectful. A traditional Fire Department funeral consists of two
raised aerial ladders. The firefighter(s) travel under the aerials on their
ride, on the fire apparatus, to the cemetery. Once there, the grave service
includes the playing of bagpipes. The pipes have come to be a distinguishing
feature of a fallen hero's funeral. Also a "Last Alarm Bell" is rung. A
portable fire department bell is tolled at the conclusion of the ceremony.
Burial service. A burial service, conducted at the side of the grave, tomb,
mausoleum or cremation, at which the body of the decedent is buried or cremated
at the conclusion. Sometimes, the burial service will immediately follow the
funeral, in which case a funeral procession travels from the site of the
memorial service to the burial site. In some other cases, the burial service is
the funeral, in which case the procession might travel from the cemetery office
to the gravesite. Other times, the burial service takes place at a later time,
when the final resting place is ready, if the death occurred in the middle of
winter. If the decedent served in a branch of the Armed forces, military rites
are often accorded at the burial service. In many religious traditions,
pallbearers, usually males who are close, but not immediate relatives (such as
cousins, nephews or grandchildren) or friends of the decedent, will carry the
casket from the chapel (of a funeral home or church) to the hearse, and from
the hearse to the site of the burial service. The pallbearers often sit in a
special reserved section during the memorial service. According to most
religions, coffins are kept closed during the burial ceremony. In Eastern
Orthodox funerals, the coffins are reopened just before burial to allow loved
ones to look at the deceased one last time and give their final farewells.
Greek funerals are an exception as the coffin is open during the whole
procedure unless the state of the body does not allow it. The morticians will
typically ensure that all jewelry, including wristwatch, that were displayed at
the wake are in the casket before it is buried or entombed. Custom requires
that everything goes into the ground; however this is not true for Jewish
services. Jewish tradition is that nothing of value is buried with the
deceased. There is an exception, in the case of cremation. Such items tend to
melt or suffer damage, so they are usually removed before the body goes into
the furnace. Pacemakers are removed prior to cremation ‚Äì if they were left in
they could possibly explode and damage the crematorium. Local burial
traditions. Even within a single country many local areas have their own unique
burial traditions. For example, funerals on the Isle of Lewis in Scotland are
often followed by a traditional Lewis funeral procession which involves
mourners taking turns at carrying the coffin en route to the graveyard.
Similarly burials on the Isle of Jura and parts of the Isle of Islay are often
followed by whisky, cheese and biscuits at the graveside, a tradition which
stems from the time when the long journey to the graveyard was taken on foot.
Luncheon. In many traditions, a meal or a gathering with the family is to
remember the life of the deceased often follows the burial service or the
funeral service. A luncheon can also be called a repast. This gathering may be
held at the decedent's church or house, or at a designated reception hall,
restaurant, or at the funeral home. A luncheon may also include speeches,
prayers, songs and poems. The content and itinerary may vary depending on the
family. Etiquette in different countries. Traditionally etiquette dictated that
the bereaved and other attendees at a funeral wear formal clothing, such as a
suit and tie for men or a dress for women. The most traditional color is solid
black (with a matching solid black tie for men) preferably without any
underlying pinstripes or patterns in the weave. But failing that charcoal gray
or dark navy blue may be worn. Wearing short skirts, low-cut tops, t-shirts
with advertising slogans or suggestive images, or, at Western funerals, a large
amount of white (other than a button-down shirt or blouse, a military uniform,
or in the Swedish tradition, white ties worn by male members of the immediate
family) is often seen as disrespectful. Women who are grieving the deaths of
their husbands or close partners sometimes wear a veil to conceal their faces,
although this practice is not presently common. Increasingly, the deceased have
requested before their death that the attendees of their funeral should wear
something of their favorite color or wear something specific, such as a
football shirt. A guest book may be placed in a prominent place during the
viewing. It is intended to let the next of kin know who came to the funeral, so
that thank-you letters can be mailed. It is not intended to be read by the
funeral directors as a source of referrals, so it is not the best place for
comments on the appropriateness of the funeral arrangements. Disagreements on
such matters can have lasting effects and can even affect inheritances.
Memorial services. The memorial service is a service given for the deceased
when the body is not present. The service takes place "after" inhumation or
burial at sea, after donation of the body to an academic or research
institution, or after the cremated remains have been scattered. It is also
significant when the person is missing and presumed dead, or known to be
deceased though the body is not recoverable. These services often take place at
a funeral home; however, they can be held in a home, school, workplace, or
other location of some significance. A memorial service may include speeches
(eulogies), prayers, poems, or songs to commemorate the deceased. Pictures of
the deceased and flowers are usually placed at the altar where the body would
normally be placed. After the sudden deaths of important public officials,
public memorial services have been held by communities, including those without
any specific connection to the deceased. For examples, community memorial
services were held after the assassination of James A. Garfield and the
assassination of William McKinley. Other types of funerals. New Orleans jazz
funeral. A unique funeral tradition in the United States occurs in New Orleans,
Louisiana. The tradition arose from a combination of African spiritual
practices, French musical traditions, and African-American cultural influences.
A typical jazz funeral begins with a march by the family, friends, and a jazz
band, starting from the home, funeral home, or church, and proceeding to the
cemetery. Throughout the march, the band plays very somber dirges. Once the
final ceremony has taken place, the march proceeds from the cemetery to a
gathering place, and the solemn music is replaced by loud, upbeat, raucous
music and dancing where onlookers join in to celebrate the life of the
deceased. This is the origin of the New Orleans dance known as the "second
line" where celebrants do a dance-march, frequently while raising the hats and
umbrellas brought along as protection from intense New Orleans weather and
waving handkerchiefs above the head that are no longer being used to wipe away
tears. ‚ÄúGreen‚Äù funeral. Those with concerns about the effects on the
environment of traditional burial or cremation may choose to be buried in a
fashion more suited to their beliefs. They may choose to be buried in an all
natural bio-degradable green burial shroud, sometimes a simple coffin made of
cardboard or other easily biodegradable material. Further, they may choose
their final resting place to be in a park or woodland, known as an eco-
cemetery, and may have a tree planted over their grave as a contribution to the
environment and a remembrance. Humanist funeral. Non-religious funerals are
legal within the UK. The British Humanist Association organises a network of
humanist funeral celebrants or officiants across England and Wales, and a
similar network is organised by the Humanist Society of Scotland. Humanist
officiants are trained and experienced in devising and conducting suitable
ceremonies. Humanist funerals recognise no "after-life", but celebrate the life
of the person who has died. Humanist funerals have reportedly been held in
recent years for Claire Rayner, Keith Floyd, Linda Smith, and Ronnie Barker,
among others. Civil funeral. Civil funerals are an increasingly popular
alternative to religious or humanist ceremonies in the UK. Unlike a humanist
funeral, a civil funeral can contain some religious content, such as hymns or
reading if the family wish. Internet visitation/funeral. A funeral home in
North Syracuse, New York was the first to offer and broadcast a visitation and
funeral "live" on the Internet. A funeral director at the home said "It's not
new technology, just a new application." The use of a web-camera allows friends
or relatives who could not otherwise attend services to do so from any
computer. Family members and friends separated by distance, weather or
circumstance can now become part of the support network by being connected
electronically to the ceremonies. Police/fire services funerals. Funerals for
fallen members of fire or police services are common in North America (namely
United States and Canada). These funerals involve honour guards from police
forces and/or fire services from across the country and sometimes from
overseas. The presence of outside members is regarded as a sign of respect and
support from the brotherhood of fellow officers. In the case of a fallen
firefighter, the casket is often placed on top of a fire engine and draped with
a flag. For both fire and police, a parade of officers often precedes or
follows the hearse carrying the fallen comrade. East Asian funerals. In most
East Asian, South Asian and many Southeast Asian cultures, the wearing of white
is symbolic of death. In these societies, white or off-white robes are
traditionally worn to symbolize that someone has died and can be seen worn
among relatives of the deceased during a funeral ceremony. In Chinese culture,
red is strictly forbidden as it is a traditionally symbolic color of happiness.
Exceptions are sometimes made if the deceased has reached a high age,
particularly between their mid-80s to age 100. In which case, the funeral is
considered a celebration, where wearing white with some red is acceptable.
Contemporary Western influence however has meant that dark-colored or black
attire is now often also acceptable for mourners to wear (particularly for
those outside the family). In such cases, mourners wearing dark colors at times
may also wear a white or off-white armband or white robe. In Southern China a
traditional Chinese gift to the attendees upon entering is a white (and
sometimes red) envelope, usually enclosing a small sum of money (in odd
numbers, usually one dollar), a sweet, red thread, and a handkerchief, each
with symbolic meaning. Chinese custom also dictates that the said sum of money
should not be brought home. The sweet should be consumed the day of and
anything given during the funeral must not be brought home. The exception is
the red thread, which is tied to the front doorknob of the guest's house to
ward off bad luck. The repetition of 3 is common where people at the funeral
may brush their hair three times or spit three times before leaving the funeral
to ward off bad luck. This custom is also found in other East Asian and
Southeast Asian cultures however the custom the deceased's immediate family
giving gifts and money to others involved in the funeral is not practiced in
Northern China. Most Japanese funerals are conducted with Buddhist rites. Many
feature a ritual that bestows a new name on the deceased; funerary names
typically use obsolete or archaic kanji and words, to avoid the likelihood of
the name being used in ordinary speech or writing. The new names are typically
chosen by a Buddhist priest, after consulting the family of the deceased. Most
Japanese are cremated. Contemporary South Korean funerals typically mix western
culture with traditional Korean culture, largely depending on socio-economic
status, region, and religion. In almost all cases, all related males in the
family wear woven arm bands representing seniority and lineage in relation to
the deceased, and must grieve next to the deceased for a period of three days
before burying the body. During this period of time, it is customary for the
males in the family to personally greet all who come to show respect. While
burials have been preferred historically, recent trends show a dramatic
increase in cremations due to shortages of proper burial sites and difficulties
in maintaining a traditional grave. The ashes of the cremated corpse are
commonly stored in columbaria. African funerals. West African funerals. The
custom of burying the dead in the floor of dwelling-houses has been to some
degree prevalent on the Gold Coast of Africa. The ceremony is purely animist,
and apparently without any set ritual. The main exception is that the females
of the family of the deceased and their friends may undergo mournful
lamentations. In some instances they work their feelings up to an ostentatious,
frenzy-like degree of sorrow. The revelry may be heightened by the use of
alcohol, of which drummers, flute-players, bards, and singing men may partake.
The funeral may last for as much as a week. Another custom, a kind of memorial,
frequently takes place seven years after the person's death. These funerals and
especially the memorials may be extremely expensive for the family in question.
Cattle, sheep, goats, and poultry, may be offered and then consumed. The
Ashanti and Akan ethnic groups in Ghana will typically wear red and black
during funerals. For special family members, there is typically a funeral
celebration with singing and dancing to honor the life of the deceased.
Afterwards, the Akan hold a somber funeral procession and burial with intense
displays of sorrow. Other funerals in Ghana are held with the deceased put in
elaborate "fantasy coffins" colored and shaped after a certain object, such as
a fish, crab, boat, and even an airplane. The Kane Kwei Carpentry Workshop in
Teshie, named after Seth Kane Kwei who invented this new style of coffins, has
became an international reference for this form of art. East African funerals.
In Kenya funerals are an expensive undertaking. Keeping bodies in morgues to
allow for fund raising is a common occurrence more so in urban areas. Some
families opt to bury their dead in the countryside homes instead of urban
cemeteries, thus spending more money on transporting the dead. Thus funeral
culture, from some viewpoints, may appear retrogressive both socially and
economically. For example, the bereaved will take days off work to travel and
to mourn. In addition to this much time is spent preparing large amounts of
food that will be consumed during the period and expenditure is high.
Similarly, as families are big, funerals may add to their financial burdens.
Between 55% and 70% of the population earn less than $1 per day. Losing a loved
one also means losing an income. Both the bereaved and the mourners are poor,
but the endless stream of those paying their last respects, and expecting to be
fed, make a bad financial situation even worse as mourners do not make any
contribution. Funeral attendance is highly depended on status of the bereaved.
Funerals are a forum for the display of wealth and status, as reflected by such
aspects as the type of casket to the clothing of the immediate family members.
Ancient funeral rites. The most simple and natural kind of funeral monuments,
and therefore the most ancient and universal, consist in a mound of earth, or a
heap of stones, raised over the body or ashes of the departed: of such
monuments mention is made in the Book of Joshua, and in Homer and Virgil. The
place of burial amongst the Jews was never particularly determined. Ancient
Jews had burial-places upon the highways, in gardens, and upon mountains. In
the Hebrew Bible (known as the Christian Old Testament), Abraham was buried
with Sarah, his wife, in the Cave of the Patriarchs in Machpelah, the field he
bought from Ephron the Hittite; David, king of Israel, and the other kings
after him (including Uzziah of Judah) "rested with ancestors" in the burial
field that pertained to the kings. The primitive Greeks were buried in places
prepared for that purpose in their own houses; but later they established
burial grounds in desert islands, and outside the walls of towns, by that means
securing them from disturbance, and themselves from the liability of catching
infection from those who had died of contagious disorders. Classical antiquity.
Funerals in ancient Greece. The Greek word for funeral ‚Äì "kƒìde√≠a"
(Œ∫Œ∑Œ¥ŒµŒØŒ±) ‚Äì derives from the verb "kƒìdomai" (Œ∫ŒÆŒ¥ŒøŒºŒ±Œπ), that
means attend to, take care of someone. Derivative words are also "kƒìdem√≥n"
(Œ∫Œ∑Œ¥ŒµŒºœéŒΩ, "guardian") and "kƒìdemon√≠a" (Œ∫Œ∑Œ¥ŒµŒºŒøŒΩŒØŒ±,
"guardianship"). From the Cycladic civilisation in 3000BC until the Hypo-
Mycenaean era in 1200‚Äì1100 BC the main practice of burial is interment. The
cremation of the dead that appears around the 11th century BC constitutes a new
practice of burial and is probably an influence from the East. Until the
Christian era, when interment becomes again the only burial practice, both
cremation and interment had been practiced depending on the area. The ancient
Greek funeral since the Homeric era included the "pr√≥thesƒì" (œÄœÅœåŒ∏ŒµœÉŒ∑),
the "ekphor√°" (ŒµŒ∫œÜŒøœÅŒ¨), the burial and the "per√≠deipno"
(œÄŒµœÅŒØŒ¥ŒµŒπœÄŒΩŒø). In most cases, this process is followed faithfully in
Greece until today. "Pr√≥thesƒì" is the deposition of the body of the deceased
on the funereal bed and the threnody of his relatives. Today the body is placed
in the casket, that is always open in Greek funerals. This part takes place in
the house where the deceased had lived. An important part of the Greek
tradition is the "epicedium", the mournful songs that are sung by the family of
the deceased along with professional mourners (who are extinct in the modern
era). The deceased was watched over by his beloved the entire night before the
burial, an obligatory ritual in popular thought, which is maintained still.
"Ekphor√°" is the process of transport of the mortal remains of the deceased
from his residence to the church, nowadays, and afterward to the place of
burial. The procession in the ancient times, according to the law, should have
passed silently through the streets of the city. Usually certain favourite
objects of the deceased were placed in the coffin in order to "go along with
him." In certain regions, coins to pay Charon, who ferries the dead to the
underworld, are also placed inside the casket. A last kiss is given to the
beloved dead by the family before the coffin is closed. The Roman orator Cicero
describes the habit of planting flowers around the tomb as an effort to
guarantee the repose of the deceased and the purification of the ground, a
custom that is maintained until today. After the ceremony, the mourners return
to the house of the deceased for the "per√≠deipno", the dinner after the
burial. According to archaeological findings‚Äìtraces of ash, bones of animals,
shards of crockery, dishes and basins‚Äìthe dinner during the classical era was
also organized at the burial spot. Taking into consideration the written
sources, however, the dinner could also be served in the houses. Two days after
the burial, a ceremony called ‚Äúthe thirds‚Äù would take place, while eight
days after the burial, the relatives and the friends of the deceased assembled
at the burial spot, where ‚Äúthe ninths‚Äù would take place, a custom that is
maintained until today. In addition to this, in the modern era, memorial
services take place 40 days, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 1 year after the
death and from then on every year on the anniversary of the death. The
relatives of the deceased, for an unspecified length of time that depends on
them, are in mourning, during which women wear black clothes and men a black
armband. Funerals in ancient Rome. In ancient Rome, the eldest surviving male
of the household, the "pater familias", was summoned to the death-bed, where he
attempted to catch and inhale the last breath of the decedent. Funerals of the
socially prominent were usually undertaken by professional undertakers called
"libitinarii". No direct description has been passed down of Roman funeral
rites. These rites usually included a public procession to the tomb or pyre
where the body was to be cremated. The most noteworthy thing about this
procession was that the survivors bore masks bearing the images of the family's
deceased ancestors. The right to carry the masks in public was eventually
restricted to families prominent enough to have held curule magistracies.
Mimes, dancers, and musicians hired by the undertakers, as well as professional
female mourners, took part in these processions. Less well-to-do Romans could
join benevolent funerary societies ("collegia funeraticia") who undertook these
rites on their behalf. Nine days after the disposal of the body, by burial or
cremation, a feast was given ("cena novendialis") and a libation poured over
the grave or the ashes. Since most Romans were cremated, the ashes were
typically collected in an urn and placed in a niche in a collective tomb called
a "columbarium" (literally, "dovecote"). During this nine day period, the house
was considered to be tainted, "funesta", and was hung with Taxus baccata or
Mediterranean Cypress branches to warn passersby. At the end of the period, the
house was swept out to symbolically purge it of the taint of death. Several
Roman holidays commemorated a family's dead ancestors, including the
"Parentalia", held February 13 through 21, to honor the family's ancestors; and
the Feast of the Lemures, held on May 9, 11, and 13, in which ghosts ("larvae")
were feared to be active, and the "pater familias" sought to appease them with
offerings of beans. The Romans prohibited cremation or inhumation within the
sacred boundary of the city "(pomerium)", both from a sacred and civil
consideration, so that the priests might not be contaminated by touching a dead
body, and so that houses would not be endangered by funeral fires. Restrictions
on the length, ostentation, expense of and behaviour during funerals and
mourning were gradually placed by a variety of law-givers. Often the pomp and
length of rites could be politically or socially motivated to advertise or
aggrandise a particular kin group in Roman society. This was seen as
deleterious to society and conditions for grieving were set ‚Äì for instance,
under some laws, women were prohibited from loud wailing or lacerating their
faces and limits were introduced for expenditure on tombs and burial clothes.
The Romans commonly built tombs for themselves during their lifetime. Hence
these words frequently occur in ancient inscriptions, V.F. Vivus Facit, V.S.P.
Vivus Sibi Posuit. The tombs of the rich were usually constructed of marble,
the ground enclosed with walls, and planted round with trees. But common
sepulchres were usually built below ground, and called hypogea. There were
niches cut out of the walls, in which the urns were placed; these, from their
resemblance to the niche of a pigeon-house, were called columbaria. Funerals in
Scotland. An old funeral rite from the Scottish Highlands is to bury the
deceased with a wooden plate resting on his chest. In the plate were placed a
small amount of earth and salt, to represent the future of the deceased. The
earth hinted that the body would decay and become one with the earth, while the
salt represented the soul, which does not decay. This rite was known as "earth
laid upon a corpse". This practice was also carried out in Ireland, as well as
in parts of England, particularly in Leicestershire, although in England the
salt was intended to prevent air from distending the corpse. Mutes and
professional mourners. From about 1600 to 1914, there were two professions in
Europe now almost totally forgotten. The mute is depicted in art quite
frequently but in literature is probably best known from Dickens' "Oliver
Twist." Oliver is working for Sowerberry's when this conversation takes place:
"There's an expression of melancholy in his face, my dear ... which is very
interesting. He would make a delightful mute, my love". The main purpose of a
funeral mute was to stand around at funerals with a sad, pathetic face. A
symbolic protector of the deceased, the mute would usually stand near the door
of the home or church. In Victorian times, mutes would wear somber clothing
including black cloaks, top hats with trailing hatbands, and gloves. The
professional mourner, generally a woman, would shriek and wail (often while
clawing her face and tearing at her clothing), to encourage others to weep.
These people are mentioned in ancient Greek plays, and were commonly employed
throughout Europe until the beginning of the nineteenth century. They continue
to exist in Africa and the Middle East. The 2003 award-winning Philippine
comedy "Crying Ladies" revolves around the lives of three women who are part-
time professional mourners for the Chinese-Filipino community in Manila's
Chinatown. According to the film, the Chinese use professional mourners to help
expedite the entry of a deceased loved one's soul into heaven by giving the
impression that he or she was a good and loving person, well loved by many.
State funeral. Military and high-ranking political figures such as Lord Nelson,
Sir Winston Churchill, John F. Kennedy, and Ronald Reagan were offered state
funerals. Final disposition of the dead. Some cultures place the dead in tombs
of various sorts, either individually, or in specially designated tracts of
land that house tombs. Burial in a graveyard is one common form of tomb. In
some places, burials are impractical because the groundwater is too high;
therefore tombs are placed above ground, as is the case in New Orleans,
Louisiana. Elsewhere, a separate building for a tomb is usually reserved for
the socially prominent and wealthy; grand, above-ground tombs are called
mausoleums. The socially prominent sometimes had the privilege of having their
corpses stored in church crypts. In more recent times, however, this has often
been forbidden by hygiene laws. Burial was not always permanent. In some areas,
burial grounds needed to be reused due to limited space. In these areas, once
the dead have decomposed to skeletons, the bones are removed; after their
removal they can be placed in an ossuary. Burial at sea. "Burial at sea" means
the deliberate disposal of a corpse into the ocean, wrapped and tied with
weights to make sure it sinks. It is a common practice in navies and seafaring
nations; in the Church of England, special forms of funeral service were added
to the Book of Common Prayer to cover it. Space burial. Science fiction writers
have frequently analogized with "burial in space". Cremation. Cremation is also
an old custom; it was the usual mode of disposing of a corpse in ancient Rome
(along with graves covered with heaped mounds, also found in Greece,
particularly at the Karameikos graveyard in Monastiraki). Vikings were
occasionally cremated in their longships, and afterwards the location of the
site was marked with standing stones. In recent years, despite the objections
of some religious groups, cremation has become increasingly popular. Jewish law
("Halakha") forbids cremation to Orthodox Jews, believing that the soul of a
cremated person will be unable to find its final repose. The Roman Catholic
Church forbade it for many years, but since 1963 the church has allowed it, as
long as it is not done to express disbelief in bodily resurrection. The church
specifies that cremated remains are either buried or entombed; they do not
allow cremated remains to be scattered or kept at home. Many Catholic
cemeteries now have columbarium niches for cremated remains, or specific
sections for those remains. Some denominations of Protestantism allow
cremation, the more conservative denominations generally do not. The Eastern
Orthodox Church and Islam also forbid cremation. In Hindu culture. Hindus
consider the funeral as the final "samskar", or "ritual of life". Cremation is
generally mandatory for all Hindus, except for saints and children under the
age of 5¬ years. Cremation is seen as the only way in which all five
elements‚Äîfire, water, earth, air, and space would be satisfied by returning
the body to these elements as after cremation the ashes are poured into the
sacred river Ganges or into the sea. After death the body of the deceased is
placed on the ground with the head of the deceased pointing towards south which
is considered the direction of the dead. The body is anointed with sacred items
such as sandalwood paste and holy ashes, "tulsi" (basil) leaves and water from
the Ganges. The eldest son would whisper "Om namah shivay" or "Om namo
bhagavate vasudevaya" to the deceased. An oil lamp is lit besides the deceased
and chapters from the Bhagavad Gita or Garuda Purana are recited. Traditionally
the body has to be cremated within 24¬ hours after death, as keeping the body
longer is considered to lead to impurity and hinder the passage of the dead to
afterlife. Hence before cremation as the body lies in state, minimal physical
contact with the body is observed. A Hindu priest conducts the formal rituals,
after which the body is taken to the cremation ground, where the eldest son
lights the funeral pyre. This act is considered to be the most important duty
of a son as it is believed that he leads his parents from this world into
"moksha". Immediately after the cremation, the family members of the deceased
all have to take a purifying bath and observe a 12‚Äëday mourning period. This
mourning period ends on the morning of the thirteenth day on which a "Shraddh"
ceremony is conducted in which offerings are given to ancestors and other gods
in order to grant liberation, or "moksha", to the deceased. Exposure to
scavenger animals. Rarer forms of disposal of the dead include exposure to the
elements and to scavenger animals. This includes various forms of excarnation,
where the corpse is stripped of the flesh, leaving only the bones, which are
then either buried or stored elsewhere, in ossuaries or tombs for example. This
was done by some groups of Native Americans in protohistoric times. Ritual
exposure of the dead (without preservation of the bones) is practiced by
Zoroastrians in Bombay, where bodies are placed in "Towers of Silence", where
vultures and other carrion eating birds then dispose of the corpses. In the
present-day structures, the bones are collected in a central pit where
(assisted by lime) they too eventually decompose. Exposure to scavenger birds
(with preservation of some, but not all bones) is also practiced by some high-
altitude Tibetan Buddhists, where practical considerations (the lack of
firewood and a shallow active layer) seem to have led to the practice known as
"jhator" or "giving alms to the birds". Cannibalism. Cannibalism is also
practiced post-mortem in some countries. The practice has been linked to the
spread of a prion disease called kuru. Mummification. Mummification is the
drying of bodies to preserve them. The most famous practitioners were ancient
Egyptians‚Äîmany nobles and highly ranked bureaucrats had their corpses
embalmed and stored in luxurious sarcophagi inside their funeral mausoleums.
Pharaohs stored their embalmed corpses in pyramids. Promession. Promession is a
new method of disposing of the body. Patented by a Swedish company, a
promession is also known as an "ecological funeral". Its main purpose is to
return the body to soil quickly while minimizing pollution and resource
consumption. Control by the decedent of the details of the funeral. Some people
choose to make their funeral arrangements in advance so that at the time of
their death, their wishes are known to their family. However, the extent to
which decisions regarding the dispositons of a decedent's remains (including
funeral arrangements) can be controlled by the decedent while still alive vary
from one jurisdiction to another. In the United States, there are states which
allow one to make these decisions for oneself if desired, for example by
appointing an agent to carry out one's wishes; in other states, the law allows
the decedent's next-of-kin to make the final decisions about the funeral
without taking the wishes of the decedent into account. Of course, most family
members of a deceased person would regard any wishes the deceased had made
known as carrying considerable moral authority. Generally, some people may feel
that it is a person's right to have their wishes regarding their own body and
the manner in which they are memorialized respected after death, while others
may feel that funerals are rather for the benefit of the living than of the
dead. The decedent may, in most U.S. jurisdictions, provide instructions as to
his funeral by means of a last will and testament. These instructions can be
given some legal effect if bequests are made contingent on the heirs carrying
them out, with alternative gifts if they are not followed. This assumes, of
course, that the decedent has enough of an estate to make the heirs pause
before doing something that will invoke the alternate bequest. To be effective,
the will or other instrument stating the decedent's funeral wishes must be
easily available, and some notion of what it provides must be known to the
decedent's survivors: aspects of the disposition of the remains of President
Franklin Delano Roosevelt ran contrary to a number of his stated wishes, which
were found in a safe that was opened after the funeral. Anatomical gifts.
Another way of avoiding some of the rituals and costs of a traditional funeral
is for the decedent to donate some or all of her or his body to a medical
school or similar institution for the purpose of instruction in anatomy, or for
similar purposes. Students of medicine and osteopathic medicine frequently
study anatomy from donated cadavers; they are also useful in forensic research.
Making an anatomical gift is a separate transaction from being an organ donor,
in which any useful organs are removed from the unembalmed cadaver for medical
organ transplant. Under a Uniform Act in force in most jurisdictions of the
United States, being an organ donor is a simple process that can often be
accomplished when a driver's license is renewed. There are some medical
conditions, such as amputations, or various surgeries, that can make the
cadaver unsuitable for these purposes. Conversely, the bodies of people who had
certain medical conditions are useful for research into those conditions. All
US medical schools rely on the generosity of "anatomical donors" for the
teaching of anatomy. Typically the remains are cremated once the students have
completed their anatomy classes, and many medical schools now hold a memorial
service at that time as well.
