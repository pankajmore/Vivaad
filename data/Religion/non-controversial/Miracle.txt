Miracle A miracle is an event attributed to divine intervention. Alternatively,
it may be an event attributed to a miracle worker, saint, or religious leader.
A miracle is sometimes thought of as a perceptible interruption of the laws of
nature. Others suggest that God may work "with" the laws of nature to perform
what people see as miracles. Theologians say that, with divine providence, God
regularly works through created nature yet is free to work without, above, or
against it as well. In casual usage, "miracle" is seen as any event that is
statistically unlikely but beneficial, (such as surviving a natural disaster),
or simply a "wonderful" occurrence, regardless of likelihood, such as a birth.
Other miracles might be: survival of a terminal illness, escaping a life
threatening situation or 'beating the odds'. Some coincidences may be seen as
miracles. The rapid German recovery after the Second World War was sometimes
called the German Miracle. The word is often used to give an impression of
great and unusual value in a trivial context: Miracle Whip, a commercial food
product; Fort Myers Miracle, a sports team. This article deals with miracles as
supernatural, not the other usages described. Explanations for miracles. A
miracle is sometimes thought of as a perceptible interruption of the laws of
nature. Others suggest that God may work "with" the laws of nature to perform
what people see as miracles. Some theologians say that, with divine providence,
God regularly works through created nature yet is free to work without, above,
or against it as well. Supernatural acts. A miracle is a phenomenon not fully
explained by known laws of nature, or an act by some supernatural entity or
unknown, outside force. Some scientist-theologians suggest that miracles are
not violations of the laws of nature but "exploration of a new regime of
physical experience". Criteria for classifying an event as a miracle vary.
Often a religious text, such as the Bible or Quran, states that a miracle
occurred, and believers accept this as a fact. Many conservative religious
believers hold that in the absence of a plausible, parsimonious scientific
theory, the best explanation for these events is that they were performed by a
supernatural being, and cite this as evidence for the existence of a god or
gods. Some adherents of monotheistic religions assert that miracles, if
established, are evidence for the existence of an omnipotent, omniscient, and
benevolent God. Events planned by God. In rabbinic Judaism, many rabbis
mentioned in the Talmud held that the laws of nature were inviolable. The idea
of miracles that contravened the laws of nature were hard to accept; however,
at the same time they affirmed the truth of the accounts in the Tanakh.
Therefore some explained that miracles were in fact natural events that had
been set up by God at the beginning of time. In this view, when the walls of
Jericho fell, it was not because God directly brought them down. Rather, God
planned that there would be an earthquake (or some such other natural disaster)
at that place and time, so that the city would fall to the Israelites.
Instances where rabbinic writings say that God made miracles a part of creation
include Midrash "Genesis Rabbah" 5:45; Midrash "Exodus Rabbah" 21:6; and Ethics
of the Fathers/Pirkei Avot 5:6. Nonliteral interpretations of biblical
accounts. Biblical literalism is not rigidly believed by all scholars: Non-
literal interpretations of some scripture are held by both classical and modern
thinkers. This may include the use of figure of speech, allegory, and exegesis.
In Numbers 22 is the story of Balaam and the talking donkey. Many hold that for
miracles such as this, one must either assert the literal truth of this
biblical story, or one must then reject the story as false. However, some
Jewish commentators (e.g. Saadiah Gaon and Maimonides) hold that stories such
as these were never meant to be taken literally in the first place. Rather,
these stories should be understood as accounts of a prophetic experience, which
are dreams or visions. (Of course, such dreams and visions could themselves be
considered miracles.) Joseph H. Hertz, a 20th century Jewish biblical
commentator, writes that these verses "depict the continuance on the
subconscious plane of the mental and moral conflict in Balaam's soul; and the
dream apparition and the speaking donkey is but a further warning to Balaam
against being misled through avarice to violate God's command." Religious
texts. Hebrew Bible. Descriptions of miracles (Hebrew "Ness, ◊ ◊°") appear in
the Tanakh. Examples include prophets, such as Elijah who performed miracles
like the raising of a widow's dead son (1 Kings 17:17‚Äì24) and Elisha whose
miracles include multiplying the poor widow's jar of oil (2 Kings 4:1‚Äì7) and
restoring to life the son of the woman of Shunem (2 Kings 4:18‚Äì37). New
Testament. The gospels record three sorts of miracles performed by Jesus:
exorcisms, cures, and nature wonders. In St John's Gospel the miracles are
referred to as "signs" and the emphasis is on God demonstrating his underlying
normal activity in remarkable ways. In the New Testament, the greatest miracle
is the resurrection of Jesus, the event central to Christian faith. Jesus
explains in the New Testament that miracles are performed by faith in God. "If
you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'move
from here to there' and it will move." (Gospel of Matthew 17:20). After Jesus
returned to heaven, the book of Acts records the disciples of Jesus praying to
God to grant that miracles be done in his name, for the purpose of convincing
onlookers that he is alive. (Acts 4:29‚Äì31). Other passages mention false
prophets who will be able to perform miracles to deceive "if possible, even the
elect of Christ" (Matthew 24:24). 2 Thessalonians 2:9 says, "And then shall
that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of His
mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of His coming: Even him, whose
coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying
wonders, and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish;
because they received not the love of the Truth, that they might be saved."
Revelation 13:13,14 says, "And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire
come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men, and deceiveth them that
dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in
the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they sould
make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live."
Revelation 16:14 says, "For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles,
which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather
them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty." Revelation 19:20says,
"And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles
before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the
beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a
lake of fire burning with brimstone." These passages indicate that signs,
wonders, and miracles are not necessarily committed by God. Qur'an. Miracle in
the Qur'an can be defined as a supernatural intervention in the life of human
beings. According to this definition, Miracles are present "in a threefold
sense: in sacred history, in connection with Muhammad himself and in relation
to revelation." The Qur'an does not use the technical Arabic word for miracle
("Mu ødÃ≤jÃ≤iza") literally meaning "that by means of which Prophet confounds,
overwhelms, his opponents". It rather uses the term 'Ayah' (literally meaning
sign). The term "Ayah" is used in the Qur'an in the above mentioned threefold
sense: it refers to the "verses" of the Qur'an (believed to be the divine
speech in human language; presented by Muhammad as his chief Miracle); as well
as to miracles of it and the signs (particularly those of creation). To defend
the possibility of miracles and God's omnipotence against the encroachment of
the independent secondary causes, some medieval Muslim theologians such as Al-
Ghazali rejected the idea of cause and effect in essence, but accepted it as
something that facilitates humankind's investigation and comprehension of
natural processes. They argued that the nature was composed of uniform atoms
that were "re-created" at every instant by God. Thus if the soil was to fall,
God would have to create and re-create the accident of heaviness for as long as
the soil was to fall. For Muslim theologians, the laws of nature were only the
customary sequence of apparent causes: customs of God. Claims of miracles.
Religious groups. Buddhism. The "Haedong Kosung-jon" of Korea (Biographies of
High Monks) records that King Beopheung of Silla had desired to promulgate
Buddhism as the state religion. However, officials in his court opposed him. In
the fourteenth year of his reign, Beopheung's "Grand Secretary", Ichadon,
devised a strategy to overcome court opposition. Ichadon schemed with the king,
convincing him to make a proclamation granting Buddhism official state sanction
using the royal seal. Ichadon told the king to deny having made such a
proclamation when the opposing officials received it and demanded an
explanation. Instead, Ichadon would confess and accept the punishment of
execution, for what would quickly be seen as a forgery. Ichadon prophesied to
the king that at his execution a wonderful miracle would convince the opposing
court faction of Buddhism's power. Ichadon's scheme went as planned, and the
opposing officials took the bait. When Ichadon was executed on the 15th day of
the 9th month in 527, his prophecy was fulfilled; the earth shook, the sun was
darkened, beautiful flowers rained from the sky, his severed head flew to the
sacred Geumgang mountains, and milk instead of blood sprayed 100 feet in the
air from his beheaded corpse. The omen was accepted by the opposing court
officials as a manifestation of heaven's approval, and Buddhism was made the
state religion in 527 CE. The "Honch≈ç Hokke Reigenki" (c. 1040) of Japan
contains a collection of Buddhist miracle stories. Christianity. C.S. Lewis,
Norman Geisler, William Lane Craig, and other Christians have argued that
miracles are reasonable and plausible. For example, Lewis said that a miracle
is something that comes totally out of the blue. If for thousands of years a
woman can become pregnant only by sexual intercourse with a man, then if she
were to become pregnant without a man, it would be a miracle. There have been
numerous claims of miracles by people of most Christian denominations,
including but not limited to faith healings and casting out demons. Miracle
reports are especially prevalent in Roman Catholicism and Pentecostal or
Charismatic churches. Catholic Church. The Catholic Church recognizes miracles
as being works of God, either directly, or through the prayers and
intercessions of a specific saint or saints. There is usually a specific
purpose connected to a miracle, e.g. the conversion of a person or persons to
the Catholic faith or the construction of a church desired by God. The Church
says that it tries to be very cautious to approve the validity of putative
miracles. The Catholic Church says that it maintains particularly stringent
requirements in validating the miracle's authenticity. The process is overseen
by the Congregation for the Causes of Saints. The Catholic Church has
recognised several events as miracles, some of them occurring in modern times.
Before a person can be accepted as a saint, they must be confirmed as having
performed two miracles posthumously. In the procedure of beatification of Pope
John Paul II, who died in 2005, the Vatican announced on 14 January 2011 that
Pope Benedict XVI had confirmed that the recovery of Sister Marie Simon-Pierre
from Parkinson's disease was a miracle. According to the Catholic Church,
confirmed miracles have withstood the test of modern scientific scrutiny. Among
the more notable miracles approved by the Church are several Eucharistic
miracles wherein the sacramental bread and wine are transformed into Christ's
flesh and blood, such as the Miracle of Lanciano. According to 17th century
documents, a young Spanish man's leg was miraculously restored to him in 1640
after having been amputated two and a half years earlier. Another miracle
approved by the Church is the Miracle of the Sun, which occurred near F√°tima,
Portugal on October 13, 1917. Anywhere between 70,000 and 100,000 people, who
were gathered at a cove near F√°tima, witnessed the sun dim, change colors,
spin, dance about in the sky, and appear to plummet to earth, radiating great
heat in the process. After the ten-minute event, the ground and the people's
clothing, which had been drenched by a previous rainstorm, were both dry.
Velankanni (Mary) can be traced to the mid-16th century and is attributed to
three miracles: the apparition of Mary and the Christ Child to a slumbering
shepherd boy, the curing of a lame buttermilk vendor, and the rescue of
Portuguese sailors from a violent sea storm. In addition to these, the Catholic
Church attributes miraculous causes to many otherwise inexplicable phenomena on
a case-by-case basis. Only after all other possible explanations have proven
inadequate may the Church assume Divine intervention and declare the miracle
worthy of veneration by the faithful. The Church does not, however, enjoin
belief in any extra-Scriptural miracle as an article of faith or as necessary
for salvation. St. Thomas Aquinas, a prominent Doctor of the Catholic Church,
divided miracles into three types in his "Summa contra Gentiles":highest degree
in miracles comprises those works wherein something is done by God, that nature
can never do: for instance, that two bodies occupy the same place, that the sun
recede or stand still, that the sea be divided and make way to passers by.
Among these there is a certain order: for the greater the work done by God, and
the further it is removed from the capability of nature, the greater the
miracle: thus it is a greater miracle that the sun recede, than that the waters
be divided.second degree in miracles belongs to those whereby God does
something that nature can do, but not in the same order: thus it is a work of
nature that an animal live, see and walk: but that an animal live after being
dead, see after being blind, walk after being lame, this nature cannot do, but
God does these things sometimes by a miracle. Among these miracles also, there
are degrees, according as the thing done is further removed from the faculty of
nature.third degree of miracles is when God does what is wont to be done by the
operation of nature, but without the operation of the natural principles: for
instance when by the power of God a man is cured of a fever that nature is able
to cure; or when it rains without the operation of the principles of nature.
Islam. Sufi biographical literature records claims of miraculous accounts of
men and women. The miraculous prowess of the Sufi holy men includes "firasa"
(clairvoyance), the ability to disappear from sight, to become completely
invisible and practice "buruz"(exteriorization). The holy men reportedly tame
wild beasts and traverse short distances in a very short time span. They could
also produce food and rain in seasons of drought, heal the sick and help barren
women become pregnant. Judaism. During the first century BCE, a variety of
religious movements and splinter groups developed amongst the Jews in Judea. A
number of individuals claimed to be miracle workers in the tradition of Elijah
and Elisha, the ancient Jewish prophets. The Talmud provides some examples of
such Jewish miracle workers, one of whom is Honi HaM'agel, who was famous for
his ability to successfully pray for rain. Most Chasidic communities are rife
with tales of miracles that follow a yechidut, a spiritual audience with a
tzadik: barren women become pregnant, cancer tumors shrink, wayward children
become pious. Many Hasidim claim that miracles can take place in merit of
partaking of the shirayim (the leftovers from the rebbe's meal), such as
miraculous healing or blessings of wealth or piety. Criticism. Thomas Paine,
one of the Founding Fathers of the American Revolution, wrote ‚ÄúAll the tales
of miracles, with which the Old and New Testament are filled, are fit only for
impostors to preach and fools to believe‚Äù. Thomas Jefferson, principal author
of the Declaration of Independence of the United States, edited a version of
the Bible in which he removed sections of the New Testament containing
supernatural aspects as well as perceived misinterpretations he believed had
been added by the Four Evangelists. Jefferson wrote, "The establishment of the
innocent and genuine character of this benevolent moralist, and the rescuing it
from the imputation of imposture, which has resulted from artificial systems,
e.g. The immaculate conception of Jesus, his deification, the creation of the
world by him, his miraculous powers, his resurrection and visible ascension,
his corporeal presence in the Eucharist, the Trinity; original sin, atonement,
regeneration, election, orders of Hierarchy, etc. ‚ÄîT.J. invented by ultra-
Christian sects, unauthorized by a single word ever uttered by him, is a most
desirable object, and one to which Priestley has successfully devoted his
labors and learning." Robert Ingersoll wrote, "Not 20 people were convinced by
the reported miracles of Christ, and yet people of the nineteenth century were
coolly asked to be convinced on hearsay by miracles which those who are
supposed to have seen them refused to credit." Writer Christopher Hitchens,
when asked for his favorite Bible story replied ‚ÄúCasting the first stone‚Äù
is a lovely story, even though we‚Äôve found out how much it wasn‚Äôt in the
Bible to begin with. And the first of the miracles. Jesus changes water into
wine. You can‚Äôt object to that." Biologist and atheist Richard Dawkins
criticises the belief in miracles as a subversion of Occam's Razor. John Adams,
second President of the United States, wrote, "The question before the human
race is, whether the God of nature shall govern the world by his own laws, or
whether priests and kings shall rule it by fictitious miracles?" Elbert
Hubbard, American writer, publisher, artist, and philosopher, wrote "A miracle
is an event described by those to whom it was told by people who did not see
it." American Revolutionary War patriot and hero Ethan Allen wrote "In those
parts of the world where learning and science have prevailed, miracles have
ceased; but in those parts of it as are barbarous and ignorant, miracles are
still in vogue." Philosophers' explanations. Aristotelian and Neo-Aristotelian.
The Aristotelian view of God does not include direct intervention in the order
of the natural world. Jewish neo-Aristotelian philosophers, who are still
influential today, include Maimonides, Samuel ben Judah ibn Tibbon, and
Gersonides. Directly or indirectly, their views are still prevalent in much of
the religious Jewish community. Baruch Spinoza. In his Theologico-Political
Treatise Spinoza claims that miracles are merely lawlike events whose causes we
are ignorant of. We should not treat them as having no cause or of having a
cause immediately available. Rather the miracle is for combating the ignorance
it entails, like a political project. See Epistemic theory of miracles. David
Hume. According to the philosopher David Hume, a miracle is "a transgression of
a law of nature by a particular volition of the Deity, or by the interposition
of some invisible agent." The crux of his argument is this: "No testimony is
sufficient to establish a miracle, unless the testimony be of such a kind, that
its falsehood would be more miraculous, than the fact which it endeavours to
establish." S√∏ren Kierkegaard. The philosopher S√∏ren Kierkegaard, following
Hume and Johann Georg Hamann, a Humean scholar, agrees with Hume's definition
of a miracle as a transgression of a law of nature, but Kierkegaard, writing as
his pseudonym "Johannes Climacus", regards any historical reports to be less
than certain, including historical reports of such miracle transgressions, as
all historical knowledge is always doubtful and open to approximation. James
Keller. James Keller states that "The claim that God has worked a miracle
implies that God has singled out certain persons for some benefit which many
others do not receive implies that God is unfair.‚Äù An example would be "If
God intervenes to save your life in a car crash, then what was he doing in
Auschwitz?". Thus an all-powerful, all-knowing and just God, predicated in
Christianity, would not perform miracles. Littlewood. British mathematician J.
E. Littlewood suggested that individuals should statistically expect one-in-a-
million events ("miracles") to happen to them at the rate of about one per
month. By Littlewood's definition, seemingly miraculous events are actually
commonplace.
