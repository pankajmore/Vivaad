Covenant theology Covenant theology (also known as Covenantalism or Federal
theology or Federalism) is a conceptual overview and interpretive framework for
understanding the overall flow of the Bible. It uses the theological concept of
covenant as an organizing principle for Christian theology. General
description. The standard description of covenant theology views the history of
God's dealings with mankind in all of history, from Creation to Fall to
Redemption to Consummation, under the framework of three overarching
theological covenants â€” the covenants of redemption, of works, and of grace.
These three covenants are called theological because they are not explicitly
presented as such in the Bible but are thought to be theologically implicit,
describing and summarizing the wealth of Scriptural data. Within historical
Reformed Christian systems of thought, covenant theology is not merely treated
as a point of doctrine, neither is it treated as a central dogma. Rather,
Covenant is viewed as the structure by which the biblical text organizes
itself. As a framework for biblical interpretation, covenant theology stands in
contrast to dispensationalism in regard to the relationship between the Old
Covenant with national Israel and the New Covenant in Christ's blood. That such
a framework exists appears to be, at least, feasible since, from the earliest
time of the Church, the Jewish Bible has been known as the Old Testament (or
Covenant) in contrast to the Christian addition which has been known as the New
Testament (or Covenant). Regarding the theological status of modern day Jewish
people, covenant theology is often referred to as "supersessionism," or
"replacement theology" by its detractors, due to the perception that it teaches
that God has abandoned the promises made to the Jews and has replaced the Jews
with Christians as his chosen people in the earth. Covenant theologians deny
that God has abandoned his promises to Israel, but see the fulfillment of the
promises to Israel in the person and the work of the Messiah, Jesus of
Nazareth, who established the church in organic continuity with Israel, not a
separate replacement entity. Covenant theology is a prominent feature in
Protestant theology, especially in churches holding a Calvinist view of
theology such as the Reformed churches and Presbyterian churches, Reformed
Baptist churches, and, in different forms, some Methodist churches. Theological
covenants. The nature of God's covenantal relationship with his creation is not
considered automatic or of necessity. Rather, God voluntarily condescends to
establish the connection as a covenant, wherein the terms of the relationship
are set down by God alone according to his own will. In particular, covenant
theology teaches that God has established one, eternal covenant, under
different administrations. Having created man in His image as a free creature
with knowledge, righteousness, and holiness, God entered into a "covenant of
works" whereby the mandate was "do this and live" (Romans 10:5, Galatians 3:
12). "Like Adam, they have trespassed the covenant" (Hosea 6:7) is the classic
reference to the "covenant of works"; Hebrews 8:6; 9:15; 12:24 the reference
that explains God's work of redemption in the "Covenant of Grace". Covenant of
redemption. The covenant of redemption is the eternal agreement within the
Godhead in which the Father appointed the Son Jesus Christ by the power of the
Holy Spirit to redeem his elect people from the guilt and power of sin. God
appointed Christ to live a life of perfect obedience to the law and to die a
penal, substitutionary, sacrificial death (see penal substitution aspect of the
atonement) as the covenantal representative for all who trust in him. Some
covenant theologians have denied the intra-Trinitarian covenant of redemption,
or have questioned the notion of the Son's works leading to the reward of
gaining a people for God, or have challenged the covenantal nature of this
arrangement. Those who have upheld this covenant point to passages such as
Philippians 2:5-11 and Revelation 5:9-10 to support the principle of works
leading to reward; and to passages like Psalm 110 in support that this is
depicted in Scripture as a covenant . Covenant of works. The covenant of works
was made in the Garden of Eden between God and Adam who represented all mankind
as a federal head. (Romans 5:12-21) It promised life for obedience and death
for disobedience. Adam, and all mankind in Adam, broke the covenant, thus
standing condemned. The covenant of works continues to function after the fall
as the moral law. Though it is not explicitly called a covenant in the opening
chapters of Genesis, the comparison of the representative headship of Christ
and Adam, as well as passages like Hosea 6:7 have been interpreted to support
the idea. It has also been noted that Jeremiah 33:20-26 ("cf". 31:35-36)
compares the covenant with David to God's covenant with the day and the night
and the statutes of heaven and earth which God laid down at creation. This has
led some to understand all of creation as covenantal: the decree establishing
the natural laws governing heaven and earth. The covenant of works might then
be seen as the moral law component of the broader creational covenant. Thus the
covenant of works has also been called the covenant of creation, indicating
that it is not added but constitutive of the human race; the covenant of nature
in recognition of its consonance with the natural law in the human heart; and
the covenant of life in regard to the promised reward. Covenant of grace. The
covenant of grace promises eternal life for all people who receive forgiveness
of sin through Christ. He is the substitutionary covenantal representative
fulfilling the covenant of works on their behalf, in both the positive
requirements of righteousness and its negative penal consequences (commonly
described as his active and passive obedience). It is the historical expression
of the eternal covenant of redemption. Genesis 3:15, with the promise of a
"seed" of the woman who would crush the serpent's head, is usually identified
as the historical inauguration for the covenant of grace. The covenant of grace
became the basis for all future covenants that God made with mankind such as
with Noah (Genesis 6, 9), with Abraham (Genesis 12, 15, 17), with Moses (Exodus
19-24), with David (2 Samuel 7), and finally in the New Covenant founded and
fulfilled in Christ. These individual covenants are called the biblical
covenants because they are explicitly described in the Bible. Under the
covenantal overview of the Bible, submission to God's rule and living in
accordance with his moral law (expressed concisely in the Ten Commandments) is
a response to grace - never something which can earn God's acceptance
(legalism). Even in his giving of the Ten Commandments, God introduces his law
by reminding the Israelites that he is the one who brought them out of slavery
in Egypt (grace). Biblical covenants. Adamic covenant. Covenant theology first
sees a covenant of works administered with Adam in the Garden of Eden. Upon
Adam's failure, God established the covenant of grace in the promised seed
Genesis 3:15, and shows his redeeming care in clothing Adam and Eve in garments
of skin â€” perhaps picturing the first instance of animal sacrifice. The
specific covenants after the fall of Adam are seen as administered under the
overarching theological covenant of grace. Noahic covenant. The Noahic covenant
is found in Genesis 8:20-9:17. Although redemption motifs are prominent as Noah
and his family are delivered from the judgment waters, the narrative of the
flood plays on the creation motifs of Genesis 1 as de-creation and re-creation.
The formal terms of the covenant itself more reflect a reaffirmation of the
universal created order, than a particular redemptive promise. Abrahamic
covenant. The Abrahamic covenant is found in Genesis chapters 12, 15, and 17.
In contrast with the covenants made with Adam or Noah which were universal in
scope, this covenant was with a particular people. Abraham is promised a seed
and a land, although he would not see its fruition within his own lifetime. The
Book of Hebrews explains that he was looking to a better and heavenly land, a
city with foundations, whose builder and architect is God (11:8-16). The
Apostle Paul writes that the promised seed refers in particular to Christ
(Galatians 3:16). The Abrahamic covenant is Galatians 3:26 "So in Christ Jesus
you are all children of God through faith, 27 for all of you who were baptized
into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. 28 There is neither Jew nor
Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all
one in Christ Jesus. 29 If you belong to Christ, then you are Abrahamâ€™s seed,
and heirs according to the promise." Mosaic covenant. The Mosaic covenant,
found in Exodus 19-24 and the book of Deuteronomy, expands on the Abrahamic
promise of a people and a land. Repeatedly mentioned is the promise of the
Lord, "I will be your God and you will be my people" ("cf". Exodus 6:7,
Leviticus 26:12), particularly displayed as his glory-presence comes to dwell
in the midst of the people. This covenant is the one most in view by the term
"Old Covenant". Although it is a gracious covenant beginning with God's
redemptive action ("cf". Exodus 20:1-2), a layer of law is prominent.
Concerning this aspect of the Mosaic Covenant, Charles Hodge makes three points
in his "Commentary on Second Corinthians": (1) The Law of Moses was in first
place a reenactment of the covenant of works; viewed this way, it is the
ministration of condemnation and death. (2) It was also a national covenant,
giving national blessings based on national obedience; in this way it was
purely legal. (3) In the sacrificial system, it points to the Gospel of
salvation through a mediator. Davidic covenant. The Davidic covenant is found
in 2 Samuel 7. The Lord proclaims that he will build a house and lineage for
David, establishing his kingdom and throne forever. This covenant is appealed
to as God preserves David's descendants despite their wickedness ("cf". 1 Kings
11:26-39, 15:1-8; 2 Kings 8:19, 19:32-34), although it did not stop judgment
from finally arriving (compare 2 Kings 21:7, 23:26-27; Jeremiah 13:12-14).
Among the prophets of the exile, there is hope of restoration under a Davidic
king who will bring peace and justice ("cf". Book of Ezekiel 37:24-28). New
Covenant. The New Covenant is anticipated with the hopes of the Davidic
messiah, and most explicitly predicted by the prophet Jeremiah (Jer. 31:34). At
the Last Supper, Jesus alludes to this prophecy, as well as to prophecies such
as Isaiah 49:8, when he says that the cup of the Passover meal is "the New
Covenant in blood." This use of the Old Testament typology is developed further
in the Epistle to the Hebrews ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/
?search=Hebrews+7-10 see especially chs. 7-10). Jesus is the last Adam and
Israel's hope and consolation: he is the fulfillment of the law and the
prophets (Matthew 5:17-18). He is the prophet greater than Jonah (Matt 12:41),
and the Son over the house where Moses was a servant (Hebrews 3:5-6), leading
his people to the heavenly promised land. He is the high priest greater than
Aaron, offering up himself as the perfect sacrifice once for all (Hebrews 9:12,
26). He is the king greater than Solomon (Matthew 12:42), ruling forever on
David's throne (Luke 1:32). The term "New Testament" comes from the Latin
translation of the Greek "New Covenant" and is most often used for the
collection of books in the Bible, can also refer to the New Covenant as a
theological concept. Covenantal signs and seals. Since covenant theology today
is mainly Protestant and Reformed in its outlook, proponents view Baptism and
the Lord's Supper as the only two sacraments, which are sometimes called
"church ordinances." The sacraments are a sign and a seal of the covenant of
grace. Along with the preached word, they are identified as an ordinary means
of grace for salvation. The benefits of these rites do not occur from
participating in the rite itself (Latin: "ex opere operato"), but through the
power of the Holy Spirit as they are received by faith. Lord's Supper. The
Eucharist or the Lord's Supper was instituted by Jesus at a Passover meal, to
which he gave a radical reinterpretation. The festival of Passover commemorates
the Israelites' deliverance from Egypt - specifically, how the lamb's blood
which God commanded them to place on their door posts caused the Angel of Death
to "pass over" their dwellings, so that their firstborn might be spared from
the final plague. The New Testament writers understand this event
typologically: as the lamb's blood saved the Israelites from the plague, so
Jesus' substitutionary death saves God's New Covenant people from being judged
for their sins. Calvinism has generally viewed the Eucharist as a mysterious
participation in the Real Presence of Christ mediated by the Holy Spirit (that
is, real spiritual presence or pneumatic presence). This differs from Roman
Catholicism and Lutheranism which believe in the Real Presence as an actual
bodily presence of Christ, as well as from the generally Baptist position that
the supper is strictly a memorial commemoration. Baptism. Paedobaptist Covenant
theologians argue that the Abrahamic Covenant is still in force, and that God's
covenantal promise "to be your God and the God of your descendants after you"
still stands for every believer. The argument that the administration of all
(other) Biblical covenants, including the New Covenant, includes a principle of
familial, corporate inclusion or "generational succession." is therefore of
secondary importance to whether infants should be baptized or not. The familial
nature of the Abrahamic covenant is undisputed. Genesis 17"You are to undergo
circumcision, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and you. 12
For the generations to come every male among you who is eight days old must be
circumcised, including those born in your household or bought with money from a
foreignerâ€”those who are not your offspring. 13 Whether born in your household
or bought with your money, they must be circumcised." In The Acts of the
Apostles 2:38-39, the promise is seen to extend to the children of believers as
it always was in the Abrahamic Covenant. The Biblical covenants between God and
man include signs and seals that visibly represent the realities behind the
covenants. These visible signs and symbols of God's covenant redemption are
administered in a corporate manner (for instance, to households â€” see Acts
16:14-15; 16:31-34), not in an exclusively individualistic manner. Baptism is
considered to be the visible New Testament sign of entrance into the Abrahamic
Covenant and therefore may be administered individually to new believers making
a public profession of faith. Paedobaptists further believe this extends
corporately to the households of believers which typically would include
children, or individually to children or infants of believing parents (see
Infant baptism). In this view, baptism is thus seen as the functional
replacement and sacramental equivalent of the Abrahamic rite of circumcision
(see Colossians 2:11-14) and symbolizes the internal cleansing from sin, among
other things. Credobaptist Covenant theologians (such as the Baptists Benjamin
Keach, John Gill, and Charles Spurgeon) hold that baptism is only for those who
can understand and profess their faith, and they argue that the regulative
principle of worship, which many paedobaptists also advocate and which states
that elements of worship (including baptism) must be based on explicit commands
of Scripture, is violated by infant baptism. Furthermore, because the New
Covenant is described in Jeremiah 31:31-34 as a time when all who were members
of it would have the law written on their hearts and would know God, Baptist
Covenant Theologians believe only those who are born again are members of the
New Covenant. History. Concepts foundational to covenant theology can be found
in the writings of Church Fathers such as Irenaeus and Augustine. Huldrych
Zwingli and Johannes Oecolampadius were among the first reformers to speak of
God's salvation economy under the categories of a covenant of works and a
covenant of grace. John Calvin ("Institutes" 2:9-11), like Heinrich Bullinger
("A Brief Exposition of the One and Eternal Testament or Covenant of God"),
focussed on the continuity of the covenant of grace, but taught the substance
of what became classic covenant theology in terms of Law and Gospel. Early
post-reformation writings, including Zacharius Ursinus (1534â€“1583) in
"Commentary on the Heidelberg Catechism" (published posthumously, 1591), Caspar
Olevianus (1536â€“1587) in "Concerning the Substance of the Covenant of Grace
between God and the Elect" ("De substantia foederis gratuiti inter deum et
electos", 1585), and Scottish Theologian Robert Rollock (1555â€“1599) in "A
Treatise of our Effectual Calling" ("Tractatus de vocatione efficaci", 1597),
developed the covenant of works and covenant of grace scheme along the lines of
the law-gospel distinction. The interpretation of how the Reformed scholastics
treated the relationship between covenant and contract is one that has been
much debated, especially concerning the continental development of federal
theology. Lyle Bierma has challenged the notion in contemporary scholarship
that Genevan Reformers taught a unilateral and unconditional covenant
relationship whilst the Rhineland Reformers taught a bilateral contractual
relationship. He argued that Leonard Trinterudâ€™s identification of the
apparent polarisation between Calvin and Olevianus on the one hand and Luther
and Bullinger on the other hand is a faulty reading of history. Revisiting the
possible cross-fertilization of thought between the continental reformers and
English reformers such as William Tyndale, it seems that they were developing a
similar approach to federalism, namely that the covenant relationship
incorporates both a unilateral and a bilateral dimension. Classical statements
of covenant theology can be found in the British Westminster Confession of
Faith (particularly chap. 7, 8, 19), as well as in the writings of English
theologians such as John Owen (1616â€“1683), "Biblical Theology", and "An
Exposition of the Epistle to the Hebrews". The classical statements among 17th
century continental theologians include Johannes Cocceius (c. 1603-1669) in
"The Doctrine of the Covenant and Testament of God" ("Summa doctrinae de
foedere et testamento dei", 1648), Francis Turretin (1623â€“1687) in his
"Institutes of Elenctic Theology", and Hermann Witsius (1636â€“1708) in "The
Economy of the Covenants Between God and Man". It may also be seen in the
writings of Jonathan Edwards (1703â€“1758) in "Collected Writings of Jonathan
Edwards" (Vol 2, Banner of Truth edition, p.Â 950). In the United States, the
Princeton theologians (Charles Hodge, A. A. Hodge, B. B. Warfield, Geerhardus
Vos, and J. Gresham Machen) and, in the Netherlands, Herman Bavinck followed
the main lines of the classic view, teaching the Covenant of Redemption, the
Covenant of Works (Law), and the Covenant of Grace (Gospel). Recent well-known
covenant theologians in the United States include Michael Horton, J. Ligon
Duncan III, Meredith G. Kline, J. I. Packer, Richard L. Pratt, Jr., O. Palmer
Robertson and R. C. Sproul. This system is taught at schools such as Covenant
Theological Seminary, Greenville Presbyterian Theological Seminary, Knox
Theological Seminary, Reformed Theological Seminary, Westminster Theological
Seminary, and Westminster Seminary California. Recent developments. There have
been recent developments in covenant theology by Reformed and Presbyterian
pastors and theologians. Covenant structure. Kline has argued that comparisons
between the suzerainty-vassal treaties and royal grants of the Ancient Near
East provide insight in highlighting certain distinctive features of the Mosaic
covenant as a law covenant, in contrast with the other historic post-Fall
covenants. Many who have embraced Kline's insights have still insisted,
however, in accordance with the Westminster Confession of Faith, that the
Mosaic covenant was fundamentally an administration of the Covenant of Grace.
Contemporary revisions and controversy. A number of major 20th-century covenant
theologians including Karl Barth, Klaas Schilder, and John Murray have departed
from the traditional recognition of a Covenant of Works to develop a
monocovenantal scheme subsuming everything under one Covenant of Grace. The
focus of all biblical covenants is then on grace and faith. This has not been
developed consistently between the various theologians. For example, Barth,
influential in the mainline churches and in certain evangelical circles,
conceived of grace as the fundamental reality underlying all of creation.
Influential among more conservative Presbyterian and Reformed churches, Murray
acknowledged the traditional concept of a works principle as a condition for
life with Adam in the Garden of Eden, comparing Adam's works to the works of
Christ. He disputed its label as a covenant, however, preferring to call this
arrangement the Adamic administration. At Westminster Theological Seminary in
the late 1970s, Norman Shepherd, a professor of systematic theology, was
dismissed due to controversy over his teaching on justification. His views
involved a reconfiguration of covenant theology that went beyond those of
Murray, his predecessor. Shepherd denied any notion of a works or merit
principle, leading to a denial of the imputation of Christ's active obedience
to the believer. He argued that Jesus' own justification was due to his faith
and obedience. In the same way then, the believer must be justified before God
by faith and obedience. Shepherd's followers claim that the Covenant of Works
between Adam and God in the Garden of Eden was not originally part of covenant
theology, following John Murray's observation that a covenant of works at
creation does not receive explicit mention in early confessions such as the
French Confession (1559), the Scots Confession (1560), the Belgic Confession
(1561), the Thirty-Nine Articles (1562), the Heidelberg Catechism (1563), and
the Second Helvetic Confession (1566). Some of Shepherd's critics contend that
the concept of a works principle distinct from a Covenant of Grace is evident
in the commentaries and dogmatic works of the earliest covenant theologians,
particularly in the distinction made between Law and Gospel (for instance,
Zacharias Ursinus, "Commentary on the Heidelberg Catechism"). There is also
explicit articulation of a Covenant of Works in the writings of those such as
Olevianus and Rollock. Additionally, defenders of the merit-based view argue
that the concept of this works principle operating in the pre-Fall state in the
Garden of Eden as a covenant is present in the early confessions even if the
Covenant of Works is not explicitly named. Examples include Belgic Confession,
article 14, which speaks of Adam having received and transgressed the
"commandment of life"; or Heidelberg Catechism, Question and Answer 6 affirming
the goodness of man in creation. The later Westminster Confession of Faith
(1646) explicitly names the Covenant of Works which Adam transgressed (7.2;
19.1), and which "continues to be a perfect rule of righteousness" in the form
of the moral law (19.2, 3).  Kline, Michael Horton, and others have sought to
uphold the distinction of two sorts of covenant traditions: one based on merit,
earned by obedience to law (works), and the other on promise (grace). While the
consensus in Reformed theology is that works are antithetical to grace as the
means of justification, differences emerge in attempts to describe this
antithesis. On the one hand, Reformed theologians more in line with Kline tend
to say that works are ultimately the basis for grace, since God requires
perfect upholding of the law for heavenly reward. Since this is understood to
be an impossible task for the corrupted sinner, it is Christ who perfectly
obeyed the law in fulfillment of the covenant of works. Jesus, earning the
reward, graciously bestows it to his people ("cf." Luke 22:29). For example, R.
C. Sproul writes, "Man's relationship to God in creation was based "on works".
What Adam failed to achieve, Christ, the second Adam, succeeded in achieving.
"Ultimately the only way one can be justified is by works"." The sinner is thus
saved by Christ's works and not his own. Right standing before God is then due
to an alien or imputed righteousness received by faith, not by personal
faithfulness which is the fruition of salvation and not its ground. On the
other hand, Reformed theologians more in line with Murray tend to say that
works were never meant to be the basis for grace, but that grace precedes the
call for obedience. Consequently, works are the necessary response to grace and
not the precondition for it. For example, Michael Williams writes, "The
function of law within Scripture is the maintenance of relationship, not the
creation of relationship. Legal obligation is not the precondition for life and
relationship. Rather, life and relationship form the necessary environment for
obligation." While this view still affirms the necessity of the merit of
Christ, it departs from Klineâ€™s construal of merit as a fundamental principle
of the covenant of works.
