The Bible and history The Bible from a historical perspective, includes
numerous fields of study, ranging from archeology and astronomy to linguistics
and methods of comparative literature. Studying the Bible may provide insight
into ancient and modern culture, mythology, and morality. Scholars also examine
the historical context of Bible passages, the importance ascribed to events by
the authors, and the contrast between the descriptions of these events and
historical evidence of their occurrence to learn information beyond the literal
information presented in the Bible. Historical analysis of the Bible includes
questioning the "historicity of the Bible," whether the Bible is an accurate
history of ancient Israel. Materials and methods. Manuscripts and canons. The
Bible exists in multiple manuscripts, none of them autographs, and multiple
canons, none of which completely agree on which books have sufficient authority
to be included or their order (see Books of the Bible). To determine the
accuracy of a copied manuscript, textual critics scrutinize the way the
transcripts have passed through history to their extant forms. The higher the
volume of the earliest texts (and their parallels to each other), the greater
the textual reliability and the less chance that the transcript's content has
been changed over the years. Multiple copies may also be grouped into text
types (see New Testament text types), with some types judged closer to the
hypothetical original than others. Differences often extend beyond minor
variations and may involve, for instance, interpolation of material central to
issues of historicity and doctrine, such as the . The books comprising the
Hebrew Bible and the Old Testament (the two are almost, but not exactly, the
same) were written largely in Hebrew, with a few exceptions in Aramaic. Today
it exists in several traditions, including the Masoretic Text, the Septuagint
47 books (a Greek translation widely used in the period from the 3rd century
BCE to roughly the 5th century CE, and still regarded as authoritative by the
Orthodox Christian churches), the Samaritan Torah, the Westminster containing
the modern 39 books, and others. Variations between these traditions are useful
for reconstructing the most likely original text, and for tracing the
intellectual histories of various Jewish and Christian communities. The very
oldest fragment resembling part of the text of the Hebrew Bible so far
discovered is a small silver amulet, dating from approximately 600 BCE, and
containing a version of the Priestly Blessing ("May God make his face to shine
upon you..."). According to the dominant theory called Greek primacy, the New
Testament was originally written in Greek, of which 5,650 handwritten copies
have survived in Greek, over 10,000 in Latin. When other languages are
included, the total of ancient copies approaches 25,000. The next ancient text
to come close to rivaling that number is Homer's Iliad, which is thought to
have survived in 643 ancient copies. Recognizing this, F. E. Peters remarked
that "on the basis of manuscript tradition alone, the works that make up the
Christians' New Testament texts were the most frequently copied and widely
circulated books of antiquity". (This may be due to their preservation,
popularity, and distribution brought about by the ease of seaborne travel and
the many roads constructed during the time of the Roman Empire). When a
comparison is made between the seven major critical editions of the Greek NT
verse-by-verseÂ â€“ namely Tischendorf, Westcott-Hort, Von Soden, Vogels, Merk,
Bover, and Nestle-AlandÂ â€“ only 62.9% of verses are variant free. A four
gospel canon (the "Tetramorph") was first asserted by Irenaeus, "c". 180. The
many other gospels that then existed were eventually deemed non-canonical (see
Biblical canon) and suppressed. In his Easter letter of 367, Athanasius, Bishop
of Alexandria, gave a list of exactly the same books as what would become the
New Testament canon, and he used the phrase "being canonized" ("kanonizomena")
in regards to them. The Council of Rome in 382 under the authority of Pope
Damasus I issued an identical canon, and his decision to commission the Latin
Vulgate edition of the Bible, "c". 383, was instrumental in the fixation of the
canon in the West. See Development of the New Testament canon for details.
Texts. Hebrew Bible. The Hebrew Bible is not a single book but rather a
collection of texts, most of them anonymous, and most of them the product of
more or less extensive editing prior to reaching their modern form. These texts
are in many different genres, but three distinct blocks approximating modern
narrative history can be made out. "Torah: Genesis to Deuteronomy" God creates
the world; the world God creates is good, but it becomes thoroughly corrupted
by man's decision to sin. God destroys all but the eight remaining righteous
people in a deluge and shortens man's lifespan significantly. God selects
Abraham to inherit the land of Canaan. The children of Israel, Abraham's
grandson, go into Egypt, where their descendants are enslaved. The Israelites
are led out of Egypt by Moses (Exodus) and receive the laws of God, who renews
the promise of the land of Canaan. "Deuteronomic history: Joshua to 2 Kings"
The Israelites conquer the land of Canaan under Joshua, successor to Moses.
Under the Judges they live in a state of constant conflict and insecurity,
until the prophet Samuel anoints Saul as king over them. Saul proves unworthy,
and God selects David as his successor. Under David the Israelites are united
and conquer their enemies, and under Solomon his son they live in peace and
prosperity. But the kingdom is divided under Solomon's successors, Israel in
the north and Judah in the south, and the kings of Israel fall away from God
and eventually the people of the north are taken into captivity by outsiders.
Judah, unlike Israel, has some kings who follow God, but many do not, and
eventually it too is taken into captivity, and the Temple of God built by
Solomon is destroyed. "Chronicler's history: Chronicles and Ezra/Nehemiah"
(Chronicles begins by reprising the history of the Torah and the
Deuteronomistic history, with some differences over details. It introduces new
material following its account of the fall of Jerusalem, the event which
concludes the Deuteronomic history). The Babylonians, who had destroyed the
Temple and taken the people into captivity, are themselves defeated by the
Persians under their king Cyrus. Cyrus permits the exiles to return to
Jerusalem. The Temple is rebuilt, and the Laws of Moses are read to the people.
"Other" (Several other books of the Hebrew Bible are set in a historical
context or otherwise give information which can be regarded as historical,
although these books do not present themselves as histories). The prophets Amos
and Hosea write of events during the 8th century kingdom of Israel; the prophet
Jeremiah writes of events preceding and following the fall of Judah; Ezekiel
writes of events during and preceding the exile in Babylon; and other prophets
similarly touch on various periods, usually those in which they write. Several
books are included in some canons but not in others. Among these, Maccabees is
a purely historical work that treats of the events of the 2nd century BCE.
Others are not historical in orientation but are set in historical contexts or
reprise earlier histories, such as Enoch, an apocalyptic work of the 2nd
century BCE. New Testament. While the authorship of a number of the Pauline
epistles is largely undisputed, there is no scholarly consensus on the authors
of the other books of the New Testament, which most modern scholars acknowledge
as pseudonymous autographs written more than a generation after the events they
describe. "Gospels/Acts" Jesus is born to Joseph and Mary; he is baptised by
John the Baptist and begins a preaching and healing mission in Galilee; he
comes up to Jerusalem to celebrate Passover, is arrested, tried, condemned, and
crucified. He is raised from the dead by His own power, appears before his
followers, issuing the Great Commission, and ascends to Heaven, with a promise
to return. The followers of Jesus, who had been fearful following the
Crucifixion, are encouraged by Jesus' resurrection and continue to practice and
to preach his teachings. The Apostle Paul preaches throughout the eastern
Mediterranean, is arrested, and appeals. He is sent to Rome for trial, and the
narrative breaks off. "Epistles/Revelation" The epistles (literally "letters")
are largely concerned with theology, but the theological arguments they present
form a "history of theology". Revelation deals with the last judgement and the
end of the world. Writing and reading history. The meaning of the term
"history" is itself dependent on social and historical context. Paula McNutt,
for instance, notes that the Old Testament narratives "do not record 'history'
"in the sense that history is understood in the twentieth century" ... The
past, for biblical writers as well as for twentieth-century readers of the
Bible, has meaning only when it is considered in light of the present, and
perhaps an idealized future." (p.Â 4, "emphasis added") Biblical history has
also taken on different meanings in the modern era. The project of biblical
archaeology associated with W.F. Albright, which sought to validate the
historicity of the events narrated in the Bible through the ancient texts and
material remains of the Near East, has little in common with the view of
history described by archaeologist William Dever. In discussing the role of his
discipline in interpreting the biblical record, Dever has pointed to multiple
histories within the Bible, including the history of theology (the relationship
between God and believers), political history (usually the account of "Great
Men"), narrative history (the chronology of events), intellectual history
(ideas and their development, context and evolution), socio-cultural history
(institutions, including their social underpinnings in family, clan, tribe and
social class and the state), cultural history (overall cultural evolution,
demography, socio-economic and political structure and ethnicity),
technological history (the techniques by which humans adapt to, exploit and
make use of the resources of their environment), natural history (how humans
discover and adapt to the ecological facts of their natural environment), and
material history (artefacts as correlates of changes in human behaviour). A
special challenge for assessing the historicity of the Bible is sharply
differing perspectives on the relationship between narrative history and
theological meaning. Supporters of biblical literalism "deny that Biblical
infallibility and inerrancy are limited to spiritual, religious, or redemptive
themes, exclusive of assertions in the fields of history and science. We
further deny that scientific hypotheses about earth history may properly be
used to overturn the teaching of Scripture on creation and the flood." But
prominent scholars have expressed diametrically opposing views: "he stories
about the promise given to the patriarchs in Genesis are not historical, nor do
they intend to be historical; they are rather historically determined
expressions about Israel and Israel's relationship to its God, given in forms
legitimate to their time, and their truth lies not in their facticity, nor in
the historicity, but their ability to express the reality that Israel
experienced." This apparently irreconcilable clash of views is most acute for
the questions of the greatest contemporary political significance (such as the
promise of land by God to Abraham) and theological import (the Virgin Birth and
Resurrection of Jesus), which are also the "events" that have proved the least
susceptible to extra-biblical confirmation. Challenges to historicity. The
Hebrew Bible. Until the 18th century, the general belief in Christendom was
that the earth was created about 4,000 - 5,500 years before the birth of
Christ, and that the Garden of Eden, the Flood, the Tower of Babel, and the
stories of Abraham and the Exodus described actual events, constituting a
genuine narrative history from Creation to the founding of Israel . However,
there had always been a critical tradition as well, dating back to at least St
Augustine of Hippo (354â€“430), with interpretations "plainly at variance with
what are commonly perceived in evangelicalism as traditional views of Genesis."
The Jewish tradition has also maintained a critical thread in its approach to
biblical primeval history. The influential medieval philosopher Maimonides
maintained a skeptical ambiguity towards creation "ex nihilo" and considered
the stories about Adam more as "philosophical anthropology, rather than as
historical stories whose protagonist is the 'first man'." Greek philosophers,
Aristotle, Critolaus and Proclus held that the world was eternal. That belief
was not uncommon among learned Christians. Galileo is the name most closely
associated with the first scientific assault on biblical authority, but the
heliocentric universe was sufficiently peripheral to biblical ontology to be
eventually accommodated. Galileo's writings were on the Catholic Index of
prohibited books All traces of official opposition to heliocentrism by the
church disappeared in 1835 when these works were finally dropped from the
Index. Nevertheless heliocentricism has been accepted by most (but not all) of
today's fundamentalists. It was in fact the birth of geology, marked by the
publication of James Hutton's "Theory of the Earth" in 1788, which set in train
the intellectual revolution that would dethrone Genesis as the ultimate
authority on primeval earth and prehistory. The first casualty was the Creation
story itself, and by the early 19th century "no responsible scientist contended
for the literal credibility of the Mosaic account of creation." (p.Â 224) The
battle between uniformitarianism and catastrophism kept the Flood alive in the
emerging discipline, until Adam Sedgwick, the president of the Geological
Society, publicly recanted his previous support in his 1831 presidential
address:Quoted in  All of which left the "first man" and his putative
descendants in the awkward position of being stripped of all historical context
until Charles Darwin naturalized the Garden of Eden with the publication of
"The Origin of Species" in 1859. Public acceptance of this scientific
revolution was, and remains, uneven but the mainstream scholarly community soon
arrived at a consensus, which holds today, that Genesis 1â€“11 is a highly
schematic literary work representing theology/mythology rather than history. A
central pillar of the Bible's historical authority was the tradition that it
had been composed by the principal actors or eyewitnesses to the events
describedÂ â€“ the Pentateuch was the work of Moses, Joshua was by Joshua, and
so on. But the Protestant Reformation had brought the actual texts to a much
wider audience, which combined with the growing climate of intellectual ferment
in the 17th century that was the start of the Age of Enlightenment threw a
harsh sceptical spotlight on these traditional claims. In Protestant England
the philosopher Thomas Hobbes in his major work Leviathan denied Mosaic
authorship of the Pentateuch, and identified Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings and
Chronicles as having been written long after the events they purported to
describe. His conclusions rested on internal textual evidence, but in an
argument that resonates with modern debates, he noted: "Who were the original
writers of the several Books of Holy Scripture, has not been made evident by
any sufficient testimony of other History, (which is the only proof of matter
of fact)." The Jewish philosopher and pantheist Baruch Spinoza echoed Hobbes's
doubts about the provenance of the historical books in his "A Theologico-
Political Treatise" (published in 1670), and elaborated on the suggestion that
the final redaction of these texts was post-exilic under the auspices of Ezra
(Chapter IX). He had earlier been effectively excommunicated by the rabbinical
council of Amsterdam for his perceived heresies. The French priest Richard
Simon brought these critical perspectives to the Catholic tradition in 1678,
observing "the most part of the Holy Scriptures that are come to us, are but
Abridgments and as Summaries of ancient Acts which were kept in the Registries
of the Hebrews," in what was probably the first work of biblical textual
criticism in the modern sense. In response Jean Astruc, applying source
criticism methods common in the analysis of classical secular texts to the
Pentateuch, believed he could detect four different manuscript traditions,
which he claimed Moses himself had redacted. (p.Â 62â€“64) His 1753 book
initiated the school known as higher criticism that culminated in Julius
Wellhausen formalising the documentary hypothesis in the 1870s, which in
various modified forms still dominates understanding of the composition of the
historical narratives. By the end of the 19th century the scholarly consensus
was that the Pentateuch was the work of many authors writing from 1000 BCE (the
time of David) to 500 BCE (the time of Ezra) and redacted "c."450, and as a
consequence whatever history it contained was more often polemical than
strictly factualÂ â€“ a conclusion reinforced by the then fresh scientific
refutations of what were at the time widely classed as biblical mythologies, as
discussed above. In the following decades Hermann Gunkel drew attention to the
mythic aspects of the Pentateuch, and Albrecht Alt, Martin Noth and the
tradition history school argued that although its core traditions had genuinely
ancient roots, the narratives were fictional framing devices and were not
intended as history in the modern sense. Though doubts have been cast on the
historiographic reconstructions of this school (particularly the notion of oral
traditions as a primary ancient source), much of its critique of biblical
historicity found wide acceptance. Gunkel's observation that has in various
forms become a commonplace of contemporary criticism. In the United States the
biblical archaeology movement, under the influence of Albright, counter-
attacked, arguing that the broad outline within the framing narratives was also
true, so that while scholars could not realistically expect to prove or
disprove individual episodes from the life of Abraham and the other patriarchs,
these were real individuals who could be placed in a context proven from the
archaeological record. But as more discoveries were made, and anticipated finds
failed to materialise, it became apparent that archaeology did not in fact
support the claims made by Albright and his followers. Today, only a minority
of scholars continue to work within this framework, mainly for reasons of
religious conviction. "[Albright's] central theses have all been overturned,
partly by further advances in Biblical criticism, but mostly by the continuing
archaeological research of younger Americans and Israelis to whom he himself
gave encouragement and momentum ... The irony is that, in the long run, it will
have been the newer 'secular' archaeology that contributed the most to Biblical
studies, not 'Biblical archaeology'." The scholarly history of the Deuteronomic
history parallels that of the Pentateuch: the European tradition history school
argued that the narrative was untrustworthy and could not be used to construct
a narrative history; the American Albright school asserted that it could when
tested against the archaeological record; and modern archaeological techniques
proved crucial in deciding the issue. The test case was the book of Joshua and
its account of a rapid, destructive conquest of the Canaanite cities: but by
the 1960s it had become clear that the archaeological record did not, in fact,
support the account of the conquest given in Joshua: the cities which the Bible
records as having been destroyed by the Israelites were either uninhabited at
the time, or, if destroyed, were destroyed at widely different times, not in
one brief period. The most high-profile example was the "fall of Jericho", when
new excavations in the 1950s by Kathleen Kenyon revealed that the city had
already been abandoned by the time of Joshua. Thomas L. Thompson, a leading
minimalist scholar for example has written Proponents of this theory also point
to the fact that the division of the land into two entities, centered at
Jerusalem and Shechem, goes back to the Egyptian rule of Israel in the New
Kingdom. Solomon's empire is said to have stretched from the Euphrates in the
north to the Red Sea in the south; it would have required a large commitment of
men and arms and a high level of organization to conquer, subdue, and govern
this area. But there is little archaeological evidence of Jerusalem being a
sufficiently large city in the 10th century BCE, and Judah seems to be sparsely
settled in that time period. Since Jerusalem has been destroyed and then
subsequently rebuilt approximately 15 to 20 times since the time of David and
Solomon, some argue much of the evidence could easily have been eliminated. The
conquests of David and Solomon are also not mentioned in contemporary
histories. Culturally, the Bronze Age collapse is otherwise a period of general
cultural impoverishment of the whole Levantine region, making it difficult to
consider the existence of any large territorial unit such as the Davidic
kingdom, whose cultural features rather seem to resemble the later kingdom of
Hezekiah or Josiah than the political and economic conditions of the 11th
century. Moreover the biblical account makes no claim that they directly
governed the areas included in their empires which are portrayed instead as
tributaries. However, since the discovery of an inscription dating to the 9th
or 8th century BCE on the Tel Dan Stele unearthed in the north of Israel, which
may refer to the "house of David" as a monarchic dynast, the debate has
continued. This is still hotly disputed, as well as a heated debate extends as
to whether the united monarchy, the vast empire of King Solomon, and the
rebellion of Jeroboam ever existed, or whether they are a late fabrication. The
Mesha Stele, dated to c. 840 BCE, may reference the House of David, and
mentions events and names found in Kings. Once again there is a problem here
with the sources for this period of history. There are no contemporary
independent documents other than the claimed accounts of the Books of Samuel,
which clearly shows too many anachronisms to have been a contemporary account.
For example there is mention of late armor (1 Samuel 17:4â€“7, 38â€“39; 25:13),
use of camels (1 Samuel 30:17) and cavalry (as distinct from chariotry) (1
Samuel 13:5, 2 Samuel 1:6), iron picks and axes (as though they were common, 2
Samuel 12:31), sophisticated siege techniques (2 Samuel 20:15), there is a
gargantuan troop (2 Samuel 17:1), a battle with 20,000 casualties (2 Samuel 18:
7), and refer to Kushite paramilitary and servants, clearly giving evidence of
a date in which Kushites were common, after the 26th Dynasty of Egypt, the
period of the last quarter of the 8th century BCE. New Testament. The
historicity, teachings, and nature of Jesus are also currently debated among
biblical scholars. The "quest for the historical Jesus" began as early as the
18th century, and has continued to this day. The most notable recent
scholarship came in the 1980s and 1990s with the work of J. D. Crossan, James
D. G. Dunn, John P. Meier, E. P. Sanders and N. T. Wright being the most widely
read and discussed. The earliest New Testament texts which refer to Jesus,
Paul's letters, are usually dated in the 50s CE. Since Paul records very little
of Jesus' life and activities, these are of little help in determining facts
about the life of Jesus, although they may contain references to information
given to Paul from the eyewitnesses of Jesus. The discovery of the Dead Sea
Scrolls has shed light into the context of 1st century Judea, noting the
diversity of Jewish belief as well as shared expectations and teachings. For
example the expectation of the coming messiah, the beatitudes of the Sermon on
the Mount and much else of the early Christian movement are found to have
existed within apocalyptic Judaism of the period. This has had the effect of
centering Early Christianity much more within its Jewish roots than was
previously the case. It is now recognised that Rabbinical Judaism and "Early
Christianity" are only two of the many strands which survived until the Jewish
revolt of 66 to 70 CE, see also Split of early Christianity and Judaism. Most
modern scholars hold that the canonical Gospel accounts were written between 70
and 100 or 110 CE, four to eight decades after the crucifixion, although based
on earlier traditions and texts, such as "Q", Logia or "sayings gospels", the
passion account or other earlier literature (See List of Gospels). Some
scholars argue that these accounts were compiled by witnesses although this
view is disputed by other scholars. There are also secular references to Jesus,
although they are few and quite late. Almost all historical critics agree,
however, that a historical figure named Jesus taught throughout the Galilean
countryside c. 30 CE, was believed by his followers to have performed
supernatural acts, and was sentenced to death by the Romans possibly for
insurrection. Many scholars have pointed out, that the Gospel of Mark shows
signs of a lack of knowledge of geographical, political and religious matters
in Judea in the time of Jesus. Thus, today the most common opinion is, that the
author is unknown and both geographically and historically at a distance to the
narrated events although opinion varies and scholars such as Craig Blomberg
accept the more traditional view. The use of expressions that may be described
as awkward and rustic cause the Gospel of Mark to appear somewhat unlettered or
even crude. This may be attributed to the influence that Saint Peter, a
fisherman, is suggested to have on the writing of Mark. The writers of the
Gospel of Matthew and Gospel of Luke used Mark as a source, with changes and
improvement to peculiarities and crudities in Mark. The absence of evidence of
Jesus' life before his meeting with John the Baptist has led to many
speculations. It would seem that part of the explanation may lie in the early
conflict between Paul and the Desposyni Ebionim, led by James the Just,
supposedly the brother of Jesus, that led to Gospel passages critical of Jesus'
family The historical reliability of the Acts of the Apostles, the primary
source for the Apostolic Age, is a major issue for biblical scholars and
historians of Early Christianity. While some biblical scholars view the Book of
Acts as being extremely accurate and corroborated by archaeology, others view
the work as being inaccurate and in conflict with the Pauline epistles. Acts
portrays Paul as more inline with Jewish Christianity, while the Pauline
epistles record more conflict, such as the Incident at Antioch, see also Paul
of Tarsus and Judaism. Schools of archaeological and historical thought.
Overview of academic views. An educated reading of the biblical text requires
knowledge of when it was written, by whom, and for what purpose. For example,
most academics would agree that the Pentateuch was in existence some time
shortly after the 6th century BCE, but they disagree about when it was written.
Proposed dates vary from the 15th century BCE to the 6th century BCE. One
popular hypothesis points to the reign of Josiah (7th century BCE). In this
hypothesis, the events of, for example, Exodus would have happened centuries
before they were finally edited. This topic is expanded upon in dating the
Bible. An important point to keep in mind is the documentary hypothesis, which
using the biblical evidence itself, claims to demonstrate that our current
version was based on older written sources that were lost. Although it has been
modified heavily over the years, most scholars accept some form of this
hypothesis. There have also been and are a number of scholars who reject it,
for example Egyptologist Kenneth Kitchen and the late Umberto Cassuto and
Gleason Archer. There are three loosely defined historical schools of thought
with regard to the historical accuracy of the Bible, Note that historical
opinions fall on a spectrum, rather than into tightly defined camps. Since
there is a wide range of opinions regarding the historical accuracy of the
Bible, it should not be surprising that any given scholar may have views that
fall anywhere between these loosely defined camps. Maximalist â€“ Minimalist
dichotomy. The major split of biblical Scholarship into two opposing schools is
strongly disapproved by non-fundamentalist biblical scholars, as being an
attempt by so-called "conservative" Christians to portray the field as a
bipolar argument, of which only one side is correct. Recently the difference
between the Maximalist and Minimalist has reduced, however a new school started
with a work, "The Quest for the Historical Israel: Debating Archaeology and the
History of Early Israel" by Israel Finkelstein, Amihai Mazar, and Brian B.
Schmidt. This school argues that post-processual archaeology enables us to
recognise the existence of a middle ground between Minimalism and Maximalism,
and that both these extremes need to be rejected. Archaeology offers both
confirmation of parts of the biblical record and also poses challenges to the
naive interpretations made by some. The careful examination of the evidence
demonstrates that the historical accuracy of the first part of the Old
Testament is greatest during the reign of Josiah. Some feel that the accuracy
diminishes, the further backwards one proceeds from this date. This they claim
would confirm that a major redaction of the texts seems to have occurred at
about that date. Biblical minimalism. Biblical minimalists generally hold that
the Bible is principally a theological and apologetic work, and all stories
within it are of an aetiological character. The early stories are held to have
a historical basis that was reconstructed centuries later, and the stories
possess at most only a few tiny fragments of genuine historical memoryâ€”which
by their definition are only those points which are supported by archaeological
discoveries. In this view, all of the stories about the biblical patriarchs are
fictional, and the patriarchs mere legendary eponyms to describe later
historical realities. Further, biblical minimalists hold that the twelve tribes
of Israel were a later construction, the stories of King David and King Saul
were modeled upon later Irano-Hellenistic examples, and that there is no
archaeological evidence that the united kingdom of Israel, which the Bible says
that David and Solomon ruled over an empire from the Euphrates to Eilath, ever
existed. In published books, one of the early advocates of the current school
of thought known as biblical minimalism is Giovanni Garbini,"Storia e ideologia
nell'Israele antico" (1986), translated into English as "History and Ideology
in Ancient Israel"(1988). In his footsteps followed Thomas L. Thompson with his
lengthy "Early History of the Israelite People: From the Written &
Archaeological Sources" (1992) and, building explicitly on Thompson's book, P.
R. Davies' shorter work, "In Search of 'Ancient Israel' " (1992). In the
latter, Davies finds historical Israel only in archaeological remains, biblical
Israel only in Scripture, and recent reconstructions of "ancient Israel" to be
an unacceptable amalgam of the two. Thompson and Davies see the entire Hebrew
Bible (Old Testament) as the imaginative creation of a small community of Jews
at Jerusalem during the period which the Bible assigns to after the return from
the Babylonian exile, from 539 BCE onward. Niels Peter Lemche, Thompson's
fellow faculty member at the University of Copenhagen, also followed with
several titles that show Thompson's influence, including "The Israelites in
history and tradition" (1998). The presence of both Thompson and Lemche at the
same institution has led to the use of the term "Copenhagen school". Although
the immediate effect of biblical minimalism from 1992 onward was heated debate
from several sides (not just two), some calmer critiques, none of which was
neutral, eventually appeared. Biblical maximalism. There is no scholarly
controversy on the historicity of the events recounted from the Babylonian
captivity in the 6th century BCE, and that the events predating the United
Monarchy cannot be shown to have any historicity. The positions of
"maximalists" vs. "minimalists" concern the monarchy period, spanning the 10th
to 7th centuries BCE The maximalist position holds that the accounts of the
United Monarchy and the early kings of Israel, king David and king Saul, are to
be taken as largely historical. Decreasing conflict between the maximalist and
minimalist schools. In 2001, Israel Finkelstein and Neil Asher Silberman
published the book "The Bible Unearthed. Archaeology's New Vision of Ancient
Israel and the Origin of Its Sacred Texts" which advocated a view midway toward
biblical minimalism and caused an uproar among many conservatives. The 25th
anniversary issue of "Biblical Archeological Review"(March/April 2001 edition),
editor Hershel Shanks quoted several biblical scholars who insisted that
minimalism was dying, although leading minimalists deny this and a claim has
been made "We are all minimalists now". In 2003, Kenneth Kitchen, a scholar who
adopts a more maximalist point of view, authored the book "On the Reliability
of the Old Testament". Kitchen advocated the reliability of many (though not
all) parts of the Torah and in no uncertain terms criticizes the work of
Finkelstein and Silberman, to which Finkelstein has since responded. However,
despite problems with the archaeological record, some maximalists place Joshua
in the mid second millennium, at about the time the Egyptian Empire came to
rule over Canaan, and not the 13th century as Finkelstein or Kitchen claim, and
view the destruction layers of the period as corroboration of the biblical
account. The destruction of Hazor in the mid-13th century is seen as
corroboration of the biblical account of the later destruction carried out by
Deborah and Barak as recorded in the Book of Judges. The location that
Finkelstein refers to as "Ai" is generally dismissed as the location of the
biblical Ai, since it was destroyed and buried in the 3rd millennium. The
prominent site has been known by that name since at least Hellenistic times, if
not before. Minimalists all hold that dating these events as contemporary are
etiological explanations written centuries after the events they claim to
report. For the united monarchy both Finkelstein and Silberman do accept that
David and Solomon were really existing persons (no kings but bandit leaders or
hill country chieftains) from Judah about the 10th century BCE - they do not
assume that there was such a thing as united monarchy with a capital in
Jerusalem. Others such as David Ussishkin argue that those who follow the
biblical depiction of a united monarchy do so on the basis of limited evidence
while hoping to uncover real archaeological proof in the future. Gunnar Lehmann
suggests that there is still a possibility that David and Solomon were able to
become local chieftains of some importance and claims that Jerusalem at the
time was at best a small town in a sparsely populated area in which alliances
of tribal kinship groups formed the basis of society. He goes on further to
claim that it was at best a small regional centre, one of three to four in the
territory of Judah and neither David nor Solomon had the manpower or the
requisite social/political/administrative structure to rule the kind of empire
described in the Bible. These views are strongly criticized by William G.
Dever, Helga Weippert, Amihai Mazar and Amnon Ben-Tor. AndrÃ© Lemaire states in
"Ancient Israel: From Abraham to the Roman Destruction of the Temple" that the
principal points of the biblical tradition with Solomon as generally
trustworthy, as does Kenneth Kitchen, who argue that Solomon ruled over a
comparatively wealthy "mini-empire", rather than a small city-state. Recently
Finkelstein has joined with the more conservative Amihai Mazar, to explore the
areas of agreement and disagreement and there are signs the intensity of the
debate between the so-called minimalist and maximalist scholars is diminishing.
This view is also taken by Richard S. Hess, which shows there is in fact a
plurality of views between maximalists and minimalists. Jack Cargill has shown
that popular textbooks not only fail to give readers the up to date
archaeological evidence, but that they also fail to correctly represent the
diversity of views present on the subject. And Megan Bishop Moore and Brad E.
Kelle provide an overview of the respective evolving approaches and attendant
controversies, especially during the period from the mid-1980s through 2011, in
their book "Biblical History and Israel's Past".
