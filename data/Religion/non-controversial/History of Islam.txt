History of Islam The history of Islam concerns the Islamic religion and its
adherents, known as Muslims. Muslims and their religion have greatly impacted
the political, economic, and military history of the Old World, especially the
Middle East, where lies its roots. Following its origin in Mecca and Medina,
the Islamic world expanded to include people of the Islamic civilization,
inclusive of non-Muslims living in that civilization. Three centuries after the
death of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, the Arab Caliphates extended from the
Atlantic Ocean in the west to Central Asia in the east. The subsequent empires
of the Umayyads, Abbasids, Fatimids, Ajuuraan, Adal, Warsangali in Somalia,
Ghaznavids, Seljuqs, Safavids, Mughals, and Ottomans were among the influential
and distinguished powers in the world. The Islamic civilization gave rise to
many centers of culture and science and produced notable scientists,
astronomers, mathematicians, doctors, nurses and philosophers during the Golden
Age of Islam. Technology flourished; there was investment in economic
infrastructure, such as irrigation systems and canals; and the importance of
reading the Qur'an produced a comparatively high level of literacy in the
general populace. In the later Middle Ages, destructive Mongol invasions from
the East, and the loss of population in the Black Death, greatly weakened the
traditional centre of the Islamic world, stretching from Persia to Egypt, and
the Ottoman Empire was able to conquer most Arabic-speaking areas, creating an
Islamic world power again, although one that was unable to master the
challenges of the Early Modern period. Later, in modern history (18th and 19th
centuries), many Islamic regions fell under the influence of European Great
powers. After the First World War, Ottoman territories (a Central Powers
member) were partitioned into several nations under the terms of the Treaty of
S√®vres. Modern interpretations of Islamic texts advocate the unification of
religion and state ruled by a Caliph. Such a polity has not existed since the
early Islamic city-states and universal imperial period beginnings. The common
slogan "al-islam dinun was dawlatun"` (translation: Islam is a religion and a
state) is neither a Koranic verse nor a quote from the hadith, but a 19th
century political Salafi slogan popularized in opposition to Western Egyptian
influence. Such a recent origin was a handicap for a belief system bound by the
scripture revealed, and the ways of those who lived, twelve centuries earlier.
Although affected by ideologies such as communism during much of the 20th
century, the Islamic identity and the dominance of Islam on political issues
intensified during the early 21st century. Global interests in Islamic regions,
international conflicts and globalization changed the influence of Islam on the
21st century. Major periods. The Islamic state and Muslim's system of
government evolved through various stages. The precise dates of various periods
in history are more or less arbitrary. The "City-state period" lasted from 620s
to 630s. The "Imperial period" lasted from 630s to 750s. The "Universal period"
lasted from 750s to around 900s. These correspond to the early period of the
Middle Ages. The ""Decentralization" period" lasted from around 900s to the
early 1500s. This correspond to the high period and late period of the Middle
Ages. The ""Fragmentation" period" lasted from around 1500s to the late 1910s.
The contemporary period, referred to as the "National period", lasted from
1910s into the twenty-first century] Islamic Origins. In pre-Islamic Arabia
Arab people lived in the Arabian Plate. In the south of Hedjaz (principal
religious and commercial centre of Middle Ages Arabia), the Arabic tribe of
Quraysh (Adnani Arabs), to which Mohammed belonged, had been in existence. Near
Mecca, the tribe was increasing in power. The Quraysh were the guardians of the
Kaaba within the town of Mecca and was the dominant tribe of Mecca upon the
appearance of Islam. The Kaaba was an important pagan shrine. It brought
revenues to Mecca because of the multitude of pilgrims that it attracted.
Muhammad was born into the Banu Hashim tribe of the Quraysh clan, a branch of
the Banu Kinanah tribe, descended from Khuzaimah and derived its inheritance
from the Khuza'imah (House of Khuza'a). According to the traditional Islamic
view, the Qur'an (Koran) began with revelations to Muhammad (when he was 40
years old) in 610. The history of the Qur'an began when its verses were
revealed to the Sahabah during Muhammad's life. The rise of Islam began around
the time the Muslims took flight in the Hijra, moving to Medina. With Islam,
blood feuds among the Arabs lessened. Compensation was paid in money rather
than blood or only the culprit was executed. In 628, the Makkah tribe of
Quraish and the Muslim community in Medina signed a truce called the Treaty of
Hudaybiyya beginning a ten-year period of peace. War returned when the Quraish
and their allies, the tribe of 'Bakr', attacked the tribe of 'Khuza'ah', who
were Muslim allies. In 630, Muslims conquered Mecca. Muhammad died in June 632.
The Battle of Yamama was fought in December of the same year, between the
forces of the first caliph Abu Bakr and Musailima. City-states and Imperial
period. After Muhammed died, a series of Caliphs governed the Islamic State:
Abu Bakr (632-634), Umar ibn al-Khattab (Umar –Ü, 634-644), Uthman ibn Affan,
(644-656), and Ali ibn Abi Talib (656-661). These leaders are known as the
"Rashidun" or "rightly guided" Caliphs in Sunni Islam. They oversaw the initial
phase of the Muslim conquests, advancing through Persia, Egypt, the Middle East
and North Africa. As it is well known that Arabic language is written without
vowels, and when Qur'an reached the non Arabic speakers, people began having
different dielects and phonics which was changing the exact meaning of verses
in the Qur'an. This was brought to the notice of Uthman Ibn Affan. Begun in the
time of Uthman ibn Affan, the compilation of the Qur'an was finished sometime
between 650 and 656, Uthman sent copies to the different centers of the
expanding Islamic empire. From then on, thousands of Muslim scribes began
copying the Qur'an. Afterwards, factions arose and the last three Rashidun
caliphs were murdered. The death of Uthman was followed by a civil war known as
the First Fitna, and the succession to Ali ibn Abi Talib was disputed, leading
to the split between the Sunni and Shia sects, and later to competing
caliphates when the descendants of Muhammad through his daughter Fatimah and
Ali set up separate Fatimid societies. After the peace treaty with Ali's son,
Hassan ibn Ali, and the suppression of the revolt of the Kharijites, Muawiyah I
proclaimed himself Caliph in 661 and began consolidating power. In 663, a new
Kharijite revolt resulted in the death of their chief. In 664, Muawiyah and
Ziyad ibn Abi Sufyan reached an agreement: the Caliph recognised Ziyad as a
brother and appointed him governor at Basra. Ziyad took the name ibn Abi
Sufyan. Muawiyah arranged for his son Yazid I to be appointed caliph on his
death, which came in 680. Husain ibn Ali, by then Muhammad's only living
grandson, refused to swear allegiance to Yazid. He was killed in the Battle of
Karbala the same year, an event still mourned by Muslims on the Day of Ashura.
Unrest continued in the Second Fitna, but Muslim rule was extended under
Muawiyah to Rhodes, Crete, Kabul, Bukhara, and Samarkand, and expanded in North
Africa. In 664, Arab armies conquered Kabul, and in 665 pushed into the
Maghreb. The "Umayyad dynasty" (or "Ommiads"), whose name derives from Umayya
ibn Abd Shams, the great-grandfather of the first Umayyad caliph, ruled from
661 to 750. Although the Umayyad family came from the city of Mecca, Damascus
was the capital. After the death of Abdu'l-Rahman ibn Abu Bakr in 666, Muawiyah
I consolidated his power. Muawiyah I moved his capital to Damascus from Medina,
which led to profound changes in the empire. In the same way, at a later date,
the transfer of the Caliphate from Damascus to Baghdad marked the accession of
a new family to power. The Umayyads viewed Islam as a religion exclusively for
Arabs. The Umayyads paid for the state by taxing the Dhimmis. A non-Arab who
wanted to convert was supposed to first become a client of an Arab tribe. Even
after conversion, non-Arabs (mawali) did not achieve social and economic
equality. At its largest extent, the Umayyad dynasty covered more than making
it one of the largest empires the world had yet seen, and the fifth largest
contiguous empire ever. After the Umayyads were overthrown by the Abbasid
Caliphate, they fled across North Africa to Al-Andalus, where they established
the Caliphate of C√≥rdoba, which lasted until 1031 with the Fitna of al-
√Åndalus. During the caliphate of Yazid, Muslims suffered several setbacks. In
682 AD Yazid restored Uqba ibn Nafi as the governor of North Africa. Uqba won
battles against the Berbers and Byzantines. From there Uqba marched thousands
of miles westward towards Tangier, where he reached the Atlantic coast, and
then marched eastwards through the Atlas Mountains. With about 300 cavalrymen,
he proceeded towards Biskra where he was ambushed by a Berber force under
Kaisala. Uqba and all his men died fighting. The Berbers attacked and drove
Muslims from north Africa for a period. They also lost supremacy at sea, and
had to abandon the islands of Rhodes and Crete. [[File:Dome of the
Rock1.jpg|thumb| Dome of the Rock The "Mosque of Omar", on Ash-Haram Al-Sharif
(the Temple Mount), built by Abd al-Malik; completed at the end of the Second
Fitna.]] The period under Muawiya II was marked by civil wars (Second Fitna).
This would ease in the reign of Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan, a well-educated and
capable ruler. Despite the many political problems that impeded his rule, all
important records were translated into Arabic. In his reign, a currency for the
Muslim world was minted. This led to war with the Byzantine Empire under
Justinian II (Battle of Sebastopolis) in 692 in Asia Minor. The Byzantines were
decisively defeated by the Caliph after the defection of a large contingent of
Slavs. The Islamic currency was then made the exclusive currency in the Muslim
world. He reformed agriculture and commerce. Abd al-Malik consolidated Muslim
rule and extended it, made Arabic the state language, and organized a regular
postal service. The "Great Mosque of Damascus" was built by Al-Walid; completed
by the time of the succession of Sulayman. Al-Walid I began the next stage of
Islamic conquests. Under him the early Islamic empire reached its farthest
extent. He reconquered parts of Egypt from the Byzantine Empire and moved on
into Carthage and across to the west of North Africa. Muslim armies under Tariq
ibn Ziyad crossed the Strait of Gibraltar and began to conquer Spain using
North African Berber armies. The Visigoths of Spain were defeated when the
Umayyad conquered Lisbon. Spain was the farthest extent of Islamic control of
Europe (they were stopped at the Battle of Tours). In the east, Islamic armies
under Muhammad bin Qasim made it as far as the Indus Valley. Under Al-Walid,
the caliphate empire stretched from Spain to India. Al-Hajjaj bin Yousef played
a crucial role in the organization and selection of military commanders. Al-
Walid paid great attention to the expansion of an organized military, building
the strongest navy in the Ummayad era., This tactic was crucial for the
expansion to Spain. His reign is considered to be the apex of Islamic power.
Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik was hailed as caliph the day al-Walid died. He
appointed Yazid ibn al-Muhallab governor of Mesopotamia. Sulayman ordered the
arrest and execution of the family of al-Hajjaj, one of two prominent leaders
(the other was Qutaibah bin Muslim) who had supported the succession of al-
Walid's son Yazid, rather than Sulayman. Al-Hajjaj had predeceased al-Walid, so
he posed no threat. Qutaibah renounced allegiance to Sulayman, though his
troops rejected his appeal to revolt. They killed him and sent his head to
Sulayman. Sulayman did not move to Damascus on becoming Caliph, remaining in
Ramla. Sulayman sent Maslamah ibn Abd al-Malik to attack the Byzantine capital
(siege of Constantinople). The intervention of Bulgaria on the Byzantine side
proved decisive. The Muslims sustained heavy losses. Sulayman died suddenly in
717. Yazid II came to power on the death of Umar II. Yazid fought the
Kharijites, with whom Umar had been negotiating, and killed the Kharijite
leader Shawdhab. In Yazid's reign, civil wars began in different parts of the
empire. Yazid expanded the Caliphate's territory into the Caucasus, before
dying in 724. Inheriting the caliphate from his brother, Hisham ibn Abd al-
Malik ruled an empire with many problems. He was effective in addressing these
problems, and in allowing the Umayyad empire to continue as an entity. His long
rule was an effective one, and renewed reforms introduced by Umar II. Under
Hisham's rule, regular raids against the Byzantines continued. In North Africa,
Kharijite teachings combined with local restlessness to produce a significant
Berber revolt. He was also faced with a revolt by Zayd bin Ali. Hisham
suppressed both revolts. The Abbasids continued to gain power in Khurasan and
Iraq. However, they were not strong enough to make a move yet. Some were caught
and punished or executed by eastern governors. The Battle of Akroinon, a
decisive Byzantine victory, was during the final campaign of the Umayyad
dynasty. Hisham died in 743. Al-Walid II saw political intrigue during his
reign. Yazid III spoke out against his cousin Walid's "immorality" which
included discrimination on behalf of the Banu Qays Arabs against Yemenis and
non-Arab Muslims, and Yazid received further support from the Qadariya and
Murji'iya (believers in human free will). Walid was shortly thereafter deposed
in a coup. Yazid disbursed funds from the treasury and acceded to the Caliph.
He explained that he had rebelled on behalf of the Book of Allah and the Sunna.
Yazid reigned for only six months, while various groups refused allegiance and
dissident movements arose, after which he died. Ibrahim ibn al-Walid, named
heir apparent by his brother Yazid III, ruled for a short time in 744, before
he abdicated. Marwan II ruled from 744 until he was killed in 750. He was the
last Umayyad ruler to rule from Damascus. Marwan named his two sons Ubaydallah
and Abdallah heirs. He appointed governors and asserted his authority by force.
Anti-Umayyad feeling was very prevalent, especially in Iran and Iraq. The
Abbasids had gained much support. Marwan's reign as caliph was almost entirely
devoted to trying to keep the Umayyad empire together. His death signalled the
end of Umayyad rule in the East, and was followed by the massacre of Umayyads
by the Abbasids. Almost the entire Umayyad dynasty was killed, except for the
talented prince Abd ar-Rahman who escaped to Spain and founded a dynasty there.
Universal period and decentralization. Islamic Golden Age. The Abbasid dynasty
rose to power in 750, consolidating the gains of the earlier Caliphates.
Initially, they conquered Mediterranean islands including the Balearics and
Sicily. The ruling party had come to power on the wave of dissatisfaction with
the Ummayads, cultivated by the Abbasid revolutionary Abu Muslim. Under the
Abbasids Islamic civilization flourished. Most notable was the development of
Arabic prose and poetry, termed by "The Cambridge History of Islam" as its
"golden age". Commerce and industry (considered a Muslim Agricultural
Revolution) and the arts and sciences (considered a Muslim Scientific
Revolution) also prospered under Abbasid caliphs al-Mansur (ruled 754 ‚Äî 775),
Harun al-Rashid (ruled 786 ‚Äî 809), al-Ma'mun (ruled 809 ‚Äî 813) and their
immediate successors. The capital was moved from Damascus to Baghdad, due to
the importance placed by the Abbasids upon eastern affairs in Persia and
Transoxania. At this time the caliphate showed signs of fracture amid the rise
of regional dynasties. Although the Ummayad family had been killed by the
revolting Abbasids, one family member, Abd ar-Rahman I, escaped to Spain and
established an independent caliphate there in 756. In the Maghreb, Harun al-
Rashid appointed the Arab Aghlabids as virtually autonomous rulers, although
they continued to recognise central authority. Aghlabid rule was short-lived,
and they were deposed by the Shiite Fatimid dynasty in 909. By around 960, the
Fatimids had conquered Abbasid Egypt, building a capital there in 973 called
""al-Qahirah"" (meaning "the planet of victory", known today as Cairo). In
Persia the Turkic Ghaznavids snatched power from the Abbasids. Abbasid
influence had been consumed by the Great Seljuq Empire (a Muslim Turkish clan
which had migrated into mainland Persia) by 1055. Expansion continued,
sometimes by force, sometimes by peaceful proselytising. The first stage in the
conquest of India began just before the year 1000. By some 200 (from 1193 ‚Äî
1209) years later, the area up to the Ganges river had fallen. In sub-Saharan
West Africa, Islam was established just after the year 1000. Muslim rulers were
in Kanem starting from sometime between 1081 to 1097, with reports of a Muslim
prince at the head of Gao as early as 1009. The Islamic kingdoms associated
with Mali reached prominence in the 13th century. The Abbasids developed
initiatives aimed at greater Islamic unity. Different sects of the Islamic
faith and mosques, separated by doctrine, history, and practice, were pushed to
cooperate. The Abbasids also distinguished themselves from the Umayyads by
attacking the Umayyads' moral character and administration. According to Ira
Lapidus, "The Abbasid revolt was supported largely by Arabs, mainly the
aggrieved settlers of Marw with the addition of the Yemeni faction and their
Mawali". The Abbasids also appealed to non-Arab Muslims, known as "mawali", who
remained outside the kinship-based society of the Arabs and were perceived as a
lower class within the Umayyad empire. Islamic ecumenism, promoted by the
Abbasids, refers to the idea of unity of the "Ummah" in the literal meaning:
that there was a single faith. Islamic philosophy developed as the Shariah was
codified, and the four Madhabs were established. This era also saw the rise of
classical Sufism. Religious achievements included completion of the canonical
collections of Hadith of Sahih Bukhari and others. Islam recognized to a
certain extent the validity of the Abrahamic religions, the Qur'an identifying
Jews, Christians, Zoroastrians, and "Sabi'un" or "baptists" (usually taken as a
reference to the Mandeans and related Mesopotamian groups) as "people of the
book". Toward the beginning of the high Middle Ages, the doctrines of the Sunni
and Shia, two major denominations of Islam, solidified and the divisions of the
world theologically would form. These trends would continue into the Fatimid
and Ayyubid periods. Politically, the Abbasid Caliphate evolved into an Islamic
monarchy (unitary system of government.) The regional Sultanate and Emirate
governors' existence, validity, or legality were acknowledged for unity of the
state. In the early Islamic philosophy of the Iberian Umayyads, Averroes
presented an argument in "The Decisive Treatise", providing a justification for
the emancipation of science and philosophy from official Ash'ari theology;
thus, Averroism has been considered a precursor to modern secularism. Golden
Baghdad Abbasids. "Early Middle Ages" According to Arab sources in the year
750, Al-Saffah, the founder of the Abbasid Caliphate, launched a massive
rebellion against the Umayyad Caliphate from the province of Khurasan near
Talas. After eliminating the entire Umayyad family and achieving victory at the
Battle of the Zab, Al-Saffah and his forces marched into Damascus and founded a
new dynasty. His forces confronted many regional powers and consolidated the
realm of the Abbasid Caliphate. In Al-Mansur's time, Persian scholarship
emerged. Many non-Arabs converted to Islam. The Umayyads actively discouraged
conversion in order to continue the collection of the jizya, or the tax on non-
Muslims. Islam nearly doubled within its territory from 8% of residents in 750
to 15% by the end of Al-Mansur's reign. Al-Mahdi, whose name means "Rightly-
guided" or "Redeemer", was proclaimed caliph when his father was on his
deathbed. Baghdad blossomed during Al-Mahdi's reign, becoming the world's
largest city. It attracted immigrants from Arabia, Iraq, Syria, Persia and as
far away as India and Spain. Baghdad was home to Christians, Jews, Hindus, and
Zoroastrians, in addition to the growing Muslim population. Like his father Al-
Hadi was very open to his people and allowed citizens to address him in the
palace at Baghdad. He was considered an "enlightened ruler", and continued the
progressive policies of his Abbasid predecessors. His short rule was plagued by
military conflicts. The military conflicts subsided as Harun al-Rashid ruled.
His reign was marked by scientific, cultural and religious prosperity. He
established the library Bayt al-Hikma ("House of Wisdom"), and the arts and
music flourished during his reign. The Barmakid family played a decisive role
in establishing the Caliphate, but declined during his rule. According to
signed pledges during a pilgrimage to Mecca, Al-Amin received the Caliphate
from his father Harun Al-Rashid. Al-Amin faced internal rebellions. General
Tahir ibn Husayn rebelled and besieged Baghdad. Tahir led reinforcements to
regain positions lost by another officer. When Tahir pushed into the city, Al-
Amin sought to negotiate safe passage. Tahir agreed on the condition Al-Amin
turn over his sceptre, seal and other signs that he was caliph. Al-Amin tried
to leave on a boat and rejected warnings that he wait. Tahir's forces attacked
the boat and Al-Amin was thrown into the water. He swam to shore where he was
captured and executed. His head was placed on the Al Anbar Gate. Regional
powers. The Abbasids soon became caught in a three-way rivalry among Coptic
Arabs, Indo-Persians, and immigrant Turks. In addition, the cost of running a
large empire became too great. The Turks, Egyptians, and Arabs adhered to the
Sunnite sect; the Persians, a great portion of the Turkic groups, and several
of the princes in India were Shia. The political unity of Islam began to
disintegrate. Under the influence of the Abbasid caliphs, independent dynasties
appeared in the Muslim world and the caliphs recognized such dynasties as
legitimately Muslim. The first was the Tahirid dynasty in Khorasan, which was
founded during the caliph Al-Ma'mun's reign. Similar dynasties included the
Saffarids, Samanids, Ghaznavids and Seljuqs. During this time, advancements
were made in the areas of astronomy, poetry, philosophy, science, and
mathematics. High Baghdad Abbasids. "Early Middle Ages" Upon Al-Amin's death,
Al-Ma'mun became Caliph. Al-Ma'mun extended the Abbasid empire's territory
during his reign and dealt with rebellions. Al-Ma'mun had been named governor
of Khurasan by Harun, and after his ascension to power, the caliph named Tahir
as governor of his military services in order to assure his loyalty. Tahir and
his family became entrenched in Iranian politics and became powerful,
frustrating Al-Ma'mun's desire to centralize and strengthen Caliphal power. The
rising power of the Tahirid dynasty became a threat as Al-Ma'mun's own policies
alienated them and other opponents. Al-Ma'mun worked to centralize power and
ensure a smooth succession. Al-Mahdi proclaimed that the caliph was the
protector of Islam against heresy, and also claimed the ability to declare
orthodoxy. Religious scholars averred that Al-Ma'mun was overstepping his
bounds in the "Mihna", the Abbasid inquisition which he introduced in 833 four
months before he died. The "Ulama" emerged as a force in Islamic politics
during Al-Ma'mun's reign for opposing the inquisitions. The "Ulema" and the
major Islamic law schools took shape in the period of Al-Ma'mun. In parallel,
Sunnism became defined as a religion of laws. Doctrinal differences between
Sunni and Shi'a Islam became more pronounced. During the Al-Ma'mun regime,
border wars increased. Al-Ma'mun made preparations for a major campaign, but
died while leading an expedition in Sardis. Al-Ma'mun gathered scholars of many
religions at Baghdad, whom he treated well and with tolerance. He sent an
emissary to the Byzantine Empire to collect the most famous manuscripts there,
and had them translated into Arabic. His scientists originated alchemy. Shortly
before his death, during a visit to Egypt in 832, the caliph ordered the
breaching of the Great Pyramid of Giza to search for knowledge and treasure.
Workers tunneled in near where tradition located the original entrance. Al-
Ma'mun later died near Tarsus under questionable circumstances and was
succeeded by his half-brother, Al-Mu'tasim, rather than his son, Al-Abbas ibn
Al-Ma'mun. As Caliph, Al-Mu'tasim promptly ordered the dismantling of al-
Ma'mun's military base at Tyana. He faced Khurramite revolts. One of the most
difficult problems facing this Caliph was the ongoing uprising of Babak
Khorramdin. Al-Mu'tasim overcame the rebels and secured a significant victory.
Byzantine emperor Theophilus launched an attack against Abbasid fortresses. Al-
Mu'tasim sent Al-Afshin, who met and defeated Theophilus' forces at the Battle
of Anzen. On his return he became aware of a serious military conspiracy which
forced him and his successors to rely upon Turkish commanders and ghilman
slave-soldiers (foreshadowing the Mamluk system). The Khurramiyyah were never
fully suppressed, although they slowly declined during the reigns of succeeding
Caliphs. Near the end of al-Mu'tasim's life there was an uprising in Palestine,
but he defeated the rebels. During Al-Mu'tasim's reign, the Tahirid dynasty
continued to grow in power. The Tahirids were exempted from many tribute and
oversight functions. Their independence contributed to Abbasid decline in the
east. Ideologically, al-Mu'tasim followed his half-brother al-Ma'mun. He
continued his predecessor's support for the Islamic Mu'tazila sect, applying
brutal torture against the opposition. Arab mathematician Al-Kindi was employed
by Al-Mu'tasim and tutored the Caliph's son. Al-Kindi had served at the House
of Wisdom and continued his studies in Greek geometry and algebra under the
caliph's patronage. Al-Wathiq succeeded his father. Al-Wathiq dealt with
opposition in Arabia, Syria, Palestine and in Baghdad. Using a famous sword he
personally joined the execution of the Baghdad rebels. The revolts were the
result of an increasingly large gap between Arab populations and the Turkish
armies. The revolts were put down, but antagonism between the two groups grew,
as Turkish forces gained power. He also secured a captive exchange with the
Byzantines. Al-Wathiq was a patron of scholars, as well as artists. He
personally had musical talent and is reputed to have composed over one hundred
songs. When Al-Wathiq died of high fever, Al-Mutawakkil succeeded him. Al-
Mutawakkil's reign is remembered for many reforms and is viewed as a golden
age. He was the last great Abbasid caliph; after his death the dynasty fell
into decline. Al-Mutawakkil ended the Mihna. Al-Mutawakkil built the Great
Mosque of Samarra as part of an extension of Samarra eastwards. During his
reign, Al-Mutawakkil met famous Byzantine theologian Constantine the
Philosopher, who was sent to strengthen diplomatic relations between the Empire
and the Caliphate by Emperor Michael III. Al-Mutawakkil involved himself in
religious debates, as reflected in his actions against minorities. The Shƒ´ ªi
faced repression embodied in the destruction of the shrine of Hussayn ibn
 ªAlƒ´, an action that was ostensibly carried out to stop pilgrimages. Al-
Mutawakkil continued to rely on Turkish statesmen and slave soldiers to put
down rebellions and lead battles against foreign empires, notably capturing
Sicily from the Byzantines. Al-Mutawakkil was assassinated by a Turkish
soldier. Al-Muntasir succeeded to the Caliphate on the same day with the
support of the Turkish faction, though he was implicated in the murder. The
Turkish party had al-Muntasir remove his brothers from the line of succession,
fearing revenge for the murder of their father. Both brothers wrote statements
of abdication. During his reign, Al-Muntasir removed the ban on pilgrimage to
the tombs of Hassan and Hussayn and sent Wasif to raid the Byzantines. Al-
Muntasir died of unknown causes. The Turkish chiefs held a council to select
his successor, electing Al-Musta'in. The Arabs and western troops from Baghdad
were displeased at the choice and attacked. However, the Caliphate no longer
depended on Arabian choice, but depended on Turkish support. After the failed
Muslim campaign against the Christians, people blamed the Turks for bringing
disaster on the faith and murdering their Caliphs. After the Turks besieged
Baghdad, Al-Musta'in planned to abdicate to Al-Mu'tazz but was put to death by
his order. Al-Mu'tazz was enthroned by the Turks, becoming the youngest
Abbasaid Caliph to assume power. Al-Mu'tazz proved too apt a pupil of his
Turkish masters, but was surrounded by parties jealous of each other. At
Samarra, the Turks were having problems with the "Westerns" (Berbers and
Moors), while the Arabs and Persians at Baghdad, who had supported al-Musta'in,
regarded both with equal hatred. Al-Mu'tazz put his brothers Al-Mu'eiyyad and
Abu Ahmed to death. The ruler spent recklessly, causing a revolt of Turks,
Africans, and Persians for their pay. Al-Mu'tazz was brutally deposed shortly
thereafter. Al-Muhtadi became the next Caliph. He was firm and virtuous
compared to the earlier Caliphs, though the Turks held the power. The Turks
killed him soon after his ascension. Al-Mu'tamid followed, holding on for 23
years, though he was largely a ruler in name only. After the Zanj Rebellion,
Al-Mu'tamid summoned al-Muwaffak to help him. Thereafter, Al-Muwaffaq ruled in
all but name. The Hamdanid dynasty was founded by Hamdan ibn Hamdun when he was
appointed governor of Mardin in Anatolia by the Caliphs in 890. Al-Mu'tamid
later transferred authority to his son, al-Mu'tadid, and never regained power.
The Tulunids became the first independent state in Islamic Egypt, when they
broke away during this time. Al-Mu'tadid ably administered the Caliphate. Egypt
returned to allegiance and Mesopotamia was restored to order. He was tolerant
towards Shi'i, but toward the Umayyad community he was not so just. Al-Mu'tadid
was cruel in his punishments, some of which are not surpassed by those of his
predecessors. For example, the Kharijite leader at Mosul was paraded about
Baghdad clothed in a robe of silk, of which Kharijites denounced as sinful, and
then crucified. Upon Al-Mu'tadid's death, his son by a Turkish slave-girl, Al-
Muktafi, succeeded to the throne. Al-Muktafi became a favorite of the people
for his generosity, and for abolishing his father's secret prisons, the terror
of Baghdad. During his reign, the Caliphate overcame threats such as the
Carmathians. Upon Al-Muktafi's death, the vazir next chose Al-Muqtadir. Al-
Muqtadir's reign was a constant succession of thirteen Vazirs, one rising on
the fall or assassination of another. His long reign brought the Empire to its
lowest ebb. Africa was lost, and Egypt nearly. Mosul threw off its dependence,
and the Greeks raided across the undefended border. The East continued to
formally recognise the Caliphate, including those who virtually claimed
independence. At the end of the Early Baghdad Abbasids period, Empress Zoe
Karbonopsina pressed for an armistice with Al-Muqtadir and arranged for the
ransom of the Muslim prisoner while the Byzantine frontier was threatened by
Bulgarians. This only added to Baghdad's disorder. Though despised by the
people, Al-Muqtadir was again placed in power after upheavals. Al-Muqtadir was
eventually slain outside the city gates, whereupon courtiers chose his brother
al-Qahir. He was even worse. Refusing to abdicate, he was blinded and cast into
prison. His son Ar-Radi took over only to experience a cascade of misfortune.
Praised for his piety, he became the tool of the de facto ruling Minister, Ibn
Raik ("amir al-umara"; 'Amir of the Amirs'). Ibn Raik held the reins of
government and his name was joined with the Caliph's in public prayers. Around
this period, the Hanbalis, supported by popular sentiment, set up in fact a
kind of 'Sunni inquisition'. Ar-Radi is commonly regarded as the last of the
real Caliphs: the last to deliver orations at the Friday service, to hold
assemblies, to commune with philosophers, to discuss the questions of the day,
to take counsel on the affairs of State; to distribute alms, or to temper the
severity of cruel officers. Thus ended the Early Baghdad Abbasids. In the late
mid-930s, the Ikhshidids of Egypt carried the Arabic title "Wali" reflecting
their position as governors on behalf of the Abbasids, The first governor
(Muhammad bin Tughj Al-Ikhshid) was installed by the Abbasid Caliph. They gave
him and his descendants the Wilayah for 30 years. The last name Ikhshid is
Soghdian for "prince". Also in the 930s, ‚ÄòAlƒ´ ibn B≈´yah and his two younger
brothers, al-Hassan and A·∏•mad founded the B≈´yid confederation. Originally a
soldier in the service of the ZiyƒÅrƒ´ds of ·π¨abaristƒÅn, ‚ÄòAlƒ´ was able to
recruit an army to defeat a Turkish general from Baghdad named YƒÅq≈´t in 934.
Over the next nine years the three brothers gained control of the remainder of
the caliphate, while accepting the titular authority of the caliph in Baghdad.
The B≈´yids made large territorial gains. Fars and Jibal were conquered.
Central Iraq submitted in 945, before the B≈´yids took KermƒÅn (967), Oman
(967), the Jazƒ´ra (979), ·π¨abaristƒÅn (980), and Gorgan (981). After this the
B≈´yids went into slow decline, with pieces of the confederation gradually
breaking off and local dynasties under their rule becoming "de facto"
independent. Middle Baghdad Abbasids. "Early High Middle Ages" At the beginning
of the Middle Baghdad Abbasids, the Caliphate had become of little importance.
The "amir al-umara" Bajkam contented himself with dispatching his secretary to
Baghdad to assemble local dignitaries to elect a successor. The choice fell on
Al-Muttaqi. Bajkam was killed on a hunting party by marauding Kurds. In the
ensuing anarchy in Baghdad, Ibn Raik persuaded the Caliph to flee to Mosul
where he was welcomed by the Hamdanids. They assassinated Ibn Raik. Hamdanid
Nasir al-Dawla advanced on Baghdad, where mercenaries and well-organised Turks
repelled them. Turkish general Tuzun became "amir al-umara". The Turks were
staunch Sunnis. A fresh conspiracy placed the Caliph in danger. Hamdanid troops
helped ad-Daula escape to Mosul and then to Nasibin. Tuzun and the Hamdanid
were stalemated. Al-Muttaqi was at Ar Raqqah, moving to Tuzun where he was
deposed. Tuzun installed the blinded Caliph's cousin as successor, with the
title of Al-Mustakfi. With the new Caliph, Tuzun attacked the Buwayhid dynasty
and the Hamdanids. Soon after, Tuzun died, and was succeeded by one of his
generals, Abu Ja'far. The Buwayhids then attacked Baghdad, and Abu Ja'far fled
into hiding with the Caliph. Buwayhid Sultan Muiz ud-Daula assumed command
forcing the Caliph into abject submission to the Amir. Eventually, Al-Mustakfi
was blinded and deposed. The city fell into chaos, and the Caliph's palace was
looted. Once the Buwayhids controlled Baghdad, Al-Muti became caliph. The
office was shorn of real power and Shi'a observances were established. The
Buwayhids held on Baghdad for over a century. Throughout the Buwayhid reign the
Caliphate was at its lowest ebb, but was recognized religiously, except in
Iberia. Buwayhid Sultan Mu'izz al-Dawla was prevented from raising a Shi'a
Caliph to the throne by fear for his own safety, and fear of rebellion, in the
capital and beyond. The next Caliph, Al-Ta'i, reigned over factional strife in
Syria among the Fatimids, Turks, and Carmathians. The Hideaway dynasyty also
fractured. The Abbasid borders were the defended only by small border states.
Byzantine Emperor John Tzimisces attacked and deposed Al-Ta'i. By 1000 the
global Muslim population had climbed to about 4 per cent of the world total
compared to the Christian population of 10 per cent. Al-Qadir was recalled and
appointed to the office. During his Caliphate, Mahmud of Ghazni looked after
the empire. The great Mahmud of Ghazni, of Eastern fame, was friendly towards
the Caliphs, and his victories in the Indian Empire were accordingly announced
from the pulpits of Baghdad in grateful and glowing terms. Al-Qadir fostered
the Sunni struggle against Shi øism and outlawed heresies such as the Baghdad
Manifesto and the doctrine that the Qu'ran was created. He outlawed the
Mu øtazila, bringing an end to the development of rationalist Muslim
philosophy. During this and the next period, Islamic literature, especially
Persian literature, flourished under the patronage of the Buwayhids. During Al-
Qa'im's reign, the Buwayhid ruler often fled the capital and the Seljuq dynasty
gained power. Toghr√ºl overran Syria and Armenia. He then made his way into the
Capital, where he was well-received both by chiefs and people. In Bahrain, the
Qarmatian state collapsed in Al-Hasa. Arabia recovered from the Fatimids and
again acknowledged the spiritual jurisdiction of the Abbasids. Al-Muqtadi was
honored by the Seljuq Sultan Malik-Shah I, during whose reign the Caliphate was
recognized throughout the extending range of Seljuq conquest. The Sultan was
critical of the Caliph's interference in affairs of state, but died before
deposing the last of the Middle Baghdad Abbasids. Late Baghdad Abbasids. "Late
High Middle Ages" The Late Baghdad Abbasids reigned from the beginning of the
Crusades to the Seventh Crusade. The first Caliph was Al-Mustazhir. He was
politically irrelevant, despite civil strife at home and the First Crusade in
Syria. Raymond IV of Toulouse attempted to attack Baghdad, losing at the Battle
of Manzikert. The global Muslim population climbed to about 5 per cent as
against the Christian population of 11 per cent by 1100. Jerusalem was captured
by crusaders who massacred its inhabitants. Preachers travelled throughout the
caliphate proclaiming the tragedy and rousing men to recover the Al-Aqsa Mosque
from the "Franks" (European Crusaders). Crowds of exiles rallied for war
against the infidel. Neither the Sultan nor the Caliph sent an army west. Al-
Mustarshid achieved more independence while the sultan Mahmud II of Great
Seljuq was engaged in war in the East. The Banu Mazyad (Mazyadid State)
general, Dubays ibn Sadaqa (emir of Al-Hilla), plundered Bosra and attacked
Baghdad together with a young brother of the sultan, Ghiyath ad-Din Mas'ud.
Dubays was crushed by a Seljuq army under Zengi, founder of the Zengid dynasty.
Mahmud's death was followed by a civil war between his son Dawud, his nephew
Mas'ud and the atabeg Toghrul II. Zengi was recalled to the East, stimulated by
the Caliph and Dubays, where he was beaten. The Caliph then laid siege to Mosul
for three months without success, resisted by Mas'ud and Zengi. It was
nonetheless a milestone in the caliphate's military revival. After the siege of
Damascus (1134), Zengi undertook operations in Syria. Al-Mustarshid attacked
sultan Mas'ud of western Seljuq and was taken prisoner. He was later found
murdered. His son, Al-Rashid failed to gain independence from Seljuq Turks.
Zengi, because of the murder of Dubays, set up a rival Sultanate. Mas'ud
attacked; the Caliph and Zengi, hopeless of success, escaped to Mosul. The
Sultan regained power, a council was held, the Caliph was deposed, and his
uncle, son of Al-Muqtafi, appointed as the new Caliph. Ar-Rashid fled to
Isfahan and was killed by Hashshashins. Continued disunion and contests between
Seljuq Turks allowe4d al-Muqtafi to maintain control in Baghdad and to extend
it throughout Iraq. In 1139, al-Muqtafi granted protection to the Nestorian
patriarch Abdisho III. While the Crusade raged, the Caliph successfully
defended Baghdad against Muhammad II of Seljuq in the Siege of Baghdad (1157).
The Sultan and the Caliph dispatched men in response to Zengi's appeal, but
neither the Seljuqs, nor the Caliph, nor their Amirs, dared resist the
Crusaders. The next caliph, Al-Mustanjid, saw Saladin extinguish the Fatimid
dynasty after 260 years, and thus the Abbasids again prevailed. Al-Mustadi
reigned when Saladin become the sultan of Egypt and declared allegiance to the
Abbasids. An-Nasir, ""The Victor for the Religion of God"", attempted to
restore the Caliphate to its ancient dominant role. He consistently held Iraq
from Tikrit to the Gulf without interruption. His forty-seven year reign was
chiefly marked by ambitious and corrupt dealings with the Tartar chiefs, and by
his hazardous invocation of the Mongols, which ended his dynasty. His son, Az-
Zahir, was Caliph for a short period before his death and An-Nasir's grandson,
Al-Mustansir, was made caliph. Al-Mustansir founded the Mustansiriya Madrasah.
In 1236 √ñgedei Khan commanded to raise up Khorassan and populated Herat. The
Mongol military governors mostly made their camp in Mughan plain, Azerbaijan.
The rulers of Mosul and Cilician Armenia surrendered. Chormaqan divided the
Transcaucasia region into three districts based on military hierarchy. In
Georgia, the population were temporarily divided into eight tumens. By 1237 the
Mongol Empire had subjugated most of Persia, excluding Abbasid Iraq and Ismaili
strongholds, and all of Afghanistan and Kashmir. Al-Musta'sim was the last
Abbasid Caliph in Baghdad and is noted for his opposition to the rise of Shajar
al-Durr to the Egyptian throne during the Seventh Crusade. To the east, Mongol
forces under Hulagu Khan swept through the Transoxiana and Khorasan. Baghdad
was sacked and the caliph deposed soon afterwards. The Mamluk sultans and Syria
later appointed a powerless Abbasid Caliph in Cairo. Cairo Abbasid Caliphs.
"Abbasid "shadow" caliph of Cairo" "Late Middle Ages" The Abbasid "shadow"
caliph of Cairo reigned under the tutelage of the Mamluk sultans and nominal
rulers used to legitimize the actual rule of the Mamluk sultans. All the
Cairene Abbasid caliphs who preceded or succeeded Al-Musta'in were spiritual
heads lacking any temporal power. Al-Musta'in was the only Cairo-based Abbasid
caliph to even briefly hold political power. Al-Mutawakkil III was the last
"shadow" caliph. In 1517, Ottoman sultan Selim I defeated the Mamluk Sultanate,
and made Egypt part of the Ottoman Empire. Fatimid Empire. [[File:Mosquee al-

The Fatimids originated in Ifriqiya (modern-day Tunisia and eastern Algeria).
The dynasty was founded in 909 by , who legitimised his claim through descent
from Muhammad by way of his daughter FƒÅtima as-Zahra and her husband , the
first ImƒÅm, hence the name "al-FƒÅtimiyy≈´n" "Fatimid". AbdullƒÅh al-Mahdi's
control soon extended over all of central Maghreb, an area consisting of the
modern countries of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Libya, which he ruled from
Mahdia, his capital in Tunisia. The Fatimids entered Egypt in the late 10th
century, conquering the Ikhshidid dynasty and founding a capital at "al-
QƒÅhira"(Cairo) in 969. The name was a reference to the planet Mars, "The
Subduer", which was prominent in the sky at the moment that city construction
started. Cairo was intended as a royal enclosure for the Fatimid caliph and his
army, though the actual administrative and economic capital of Egypt was in
cities such as Fustat until 1169. After Egypt, the Fatimids continued to
conquer surrounding areas until they ruled from Tunisia to Syria and even
crossed the Mediterranean into Sicily and southern Italy. Under the Fatimids,
Egypt became the center of an empire that included at its peak North Africa,
Sicily, [Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, the Red Sea coast of Africa, Yemen and the
Hejaz. Egypt flourished, and the Fatimids developed an extensive trade network
in both the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean. Their trade and diplomatic ties
extended all the way to China and its Song Dynasty, which determined the
economic course of Egypt during the High Middle Ages. Unlike other governments
in the area, Fatimid advancement in state offices was based more on merit than
heredity. Members of other branches of Islam, including Sunnis, were just as
likely to be appointed to government posts as Shiites. Tolerance covered non-
Muslims such as Christians and Jews; they took high levels in government based
on ability. There were, however, exceptions to this general attitude of
tolerance, notably Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah. The Fatimid palace was in two parts.
It was in the Khan el-Khalili area at Bin El-Quasryn street. Fatimid caliphs.
"Early and High Middle Ages" During the beginning of the Middle Baghdad
Abbasids, the Fatimid Caliphs claimed spiritual supremacy not only in Egypt,
but also contested the religious leadership of Syria. At the beginning of the
Abbasid realm in Baghdad, the Alids faced severe persecution by the ruling
party as they were a direct threat to the Caliphate. Owing to the Abbasid
inquisitions, the forefathers opted for concealment of the Dawa's existence.
Subsequently, they traveled towards the Iranian Plateau and distanced
themselves from the epicenter of the political world. Al Mahdi's father, Al
Husain al Mastoor returned to control the Dawa's affairs. He sent two Dai's to
Yemen and Western Africa. Al Husain died soon after the birth of his son, Al
Mahdi. A system of information gatherers helped update Al Mahdi on each
development which took place in North Africa. Al Mahdi established the first
Imam of the Fatimid dynasty. He claimed genealogic origins dating as far back
as Fatimah through Husayn and Ismail. Al Mahdi established his headquarters at
Salamiyah and moved towards north-western Africa, under Aghlabid rule. His
success of laying claim to being the precursor to the Mahdi was instrumental
among the Berber tribes of North Africa, specifically the Kutamah tribe. Al
Mahdi established himself at the former Aghlabid residence at Raqqadah, a
suburb of Al-Qayrawan in Tunisia. At the time of his death he had extended his
reign to Morocco of the Idrisids, as well as Egypt itself. In 920, Al Mahdi
took up residence at the newly established capital of the empire, Al-Mahdiyyah.
After his death, Al Mahdi was succeeded by his son, Abu Al-Qasim Muhammad Al-
Qaim, who continued his expansionist policy. Berbers and Iberian Umayyads. The
Arabs, under the command of the Berber General Tarik ibn Ziyad, first began
their conquest of southern Spain or al-Andalus in 711. A raiding party led by
Tarik was sent to intervene in a civil war in the Visigothic kingdom in
Hispania. Crossing the Strait of Gibraltar (named after the General), it won a
decisive victory in the summer of 711 when the Visigothic king Roderic was
defeated and killed on July 19 at the Battle of Guadalete. Tariq's commander,
Musa bin Nusair crossed with substantial reinforcements, and by 718 the Muslims
dominated most of the peninsula. Some later Arabic and Christian sources
present an earlier raid by a certain ·π¨ƒÅrif in 710 and also, the Ad
Sebastianum recension of the "Chronicle of Alfonso III", refers to an Arab
attack incited by Erwig during the reign of Wamba (672‚Äì80). The two large
armies may have been in the south for a year before the decisive battle was
fought. The rulers of Al-Andalus were granted the rank of Emir by the Umayyad
Caliph Al-Walid I in Damascus. After the Abbasids came to power, some Umayyads
fled to Muslim Spain to establish themselves there. By the end of the 10th
century, the ruler Abd al-Rahman III took over the title of "Emir of C√≥rdoba"
(912-961). Soon after, the Umayyads went on developing a strengthened state
with its capital as C√≥rdoba. Al-Hakam II succeeded to the Caliphate after the
death of his father Abd ar-Rahman III in 961. He secured peace with the
Christian kingdoms of northern Iberia, and made use of the stability to develop
agriculture through the construction of irrigation works. Economical
development was also encouraged through the widening of streets and the
building of markets. The rule of the Caliphate is known as the heyday of Muslim
presence in the peninsula. The Umayyad Caliphate collapsed in 1031 due to
political divisions and civil unrest during the rule of Hicham II who was
ousted because of his indolence. Al-Andalus then broke up into a number of
states called "taifa kingdoms" (Arabic, "Muluk al-·π≠awƒÅ'if"; English, Petty
kingdoms). The decomposition of the Caliphate into those petty kingdoms
weakened the Muslims in the Iberian Peninsula "vis-√ -vis" the Christian
kingdoms of the north. Some of the "taifas", such as that of Seville, were
forced to enter into alliances with Christian princes and pay tributes in money
to Castille. Emirs of C√≥rdoba. Abd al-Rahman I and Bedr (a former Greek slave)
escaped with their lives after the popular revolt known as the Abbasid
Revolution. Rahman I continued south through Palestine, the Sinai, and then
into Egypt. Rahman I was one of several surviving Umayyad family members to
make a perilous trek to Ifriqiya at this time. Rahman I and Bedr reached modern
day Morocco near Ceuta. Next step would be to cross to sea to al-Andalus, where
Rahman I could not have been sure whether he would be welcome. Following the
Berber Revolt (740s), the province was in a state of confusion, with the Ummah
torn by tribal dissensions among the Arabs and racial tensions between the
Arabs and Berbers. Bedr lined up three Syrian commanders ‚Äì Obeid Allah ibn
Uthman and Abd Allah ibn Khalid, both originally of Damascus, and Yusuf ibn
Bukht of Qinnasrin and contacted al-Sumayl (then in Zaragoza) to get his
consent, but al-Sumayl refused, fearing Rahman I would try to make himself
emir. After discussion with Yemenite commanders, Rahman I was told to go to al-
Andalus. Shortly thereafter, he set off with Bedr and a small group of
followers for Europe. Abd al-Rahman landed at Almu√±√©car in al-Andalus, to the
east of M√°laga. During his brief time in M√°laga, he quickly amassed local
support. News of the prince's arrival spread throughout the peninsula. In order
to help speed his ascension to power, he took advantage of the feuds and
dissensions. However, before anything could be done, trouble broke out in
northern al-Andalus. Abd al-Rahman and his followers were able to control
Zaragoza. Rahman I fought to rule al-Andalus in a battle at the Guadalquivir
river, just outside of C√≥rdoba on the plains of Musarah (Battle of Musarah).
Rahman I was victorious, chasing his enemies from the field with parts of their
army. Rahman I marched into the capital, C√≥rdoba, fighting off a
counterattack, but negotiations ended the confrontation. After Rahman I
consolidated power, he proclaimed himself the al-Andalus emir. Rahman I did not
claim the Muslim caliph, though. The last step was to have al-Fihri's general,
al-Sumayl, garroted in C√≥rdoba's jail. Al-Andalus was a for the house of
Umayya that managed to evade the Abbasids. In Baghdad, the Abbasid caliph al-
Mansur had planned to depose the emir. Rahman I and his army confronted the
Abbasids, killing most of the Abbasid army. The main Abbasid leaders were
decapitated, their heads preserved in salt, with identifying tags pinned to
their ears. The heads were bundled in a gruesome package and sent to the
Abbasid caliph who was on pilgrimage at Mecca. Rahman I quelled repeated
rebellions in al-Andalus. Near the end of his life, it is said that Abd al-
Rahman became increasingly paranoid and sequestered himself in his palaces.
Rahman I's successor was his son Hisham I. Born in C√≥rdoba, he built many
mosques and completed the Mezquita. He called for a jihad that resulted in a
campaign against the Kingdom of Asturias and the County of Toulouse; in this
second campaign he was defeated at Orange by William of Gellone, first cousin
to Charlemagne. His successor Al-Hakam I came to power and was challenged by
his uncles, other sons of Rahman I. One, Abdallah, went to the court of
Charlemagne in Aix-la-Chapelle to negotiate for aid. In the mean time C√≥rdoba
was attacked, but was defended. Hakam I spent much of his reign suppressing
rebellions in Toledo, Saragossa and M√©rida. Abd ar-Rahman II succeeded his
father and engaged in nearly continuous warfare against Alfonso II of Asturias,
whose southward advance he halted. Rahman III repulsed an assault by Vikings
who had disembarked in Cadiz, conquered Seville (with the exception of its
citadel) and attacked C√≥rdoba. Thereafter he constructed a fleet and naval
arsenal at Seville to repel future raids. He responded to William of
Septimania's requests of assistance in his struggle against Charles the Bald's
nominations. Muhammad I's reign was marked by the movements of the Muladi
(ethnic Iberian Muslims) and Mozarabs (Muslim-Iberia Christians). Muhammad I
was succeeded by his son Mundhir I. During the reign of his father, Mundhir I
commanded military operations against the neighbouring Christian kingdoms and
the Muladi rebellions. At his father's death, he inherited the throne. During
his two year reign, Mundhir I fought against Umar ibn Hafsun. He died in 888 at
Bobastro, succeeded by his brother Abdullah ibn Muhammad al-Umawi. Umawi showed
no reluctance to dispose of those he viewed as a threat. His government was
marked by continuous wars between Arabs, Berbers and Muladi. His power as emir
was confined to the area of C√≥rdoba, while the rest had been seized by rebel
families. The son he had designated as successor was killed by one of Umawi's
brothers. The latter was in turn executed by Umawi's father, who named as
successor Abd ar-Rahman III, son of the killed son of Umawi. Caliphs at

century, the Iberian Christian kingdoms had begun the Reconquista aimed at
retaking Al-Andalus from the Moors. In 1095, Pope Urban II, inspired by the
conquests in Spain by Christian forces and implored by the eastern Roman
emperor to help defend Christianity in the East, called for the First Crusade
from Western Europe which captured Odessa, Antioch, Tripoli and Jerusalem. In
the early period of the Crusades, the Christian Kingdom of Jerusalem emerged
and for a time controlled Jerusalem. The Kingdom of Jerusalem and other smaller
Crusader kingdoms over the next 90 years formed part of the complicated
politics of the Levant, but did not in threaten the Islamic Caliphate nor other
powers in the region. After Shirkuh ended Fatimid rule in 1169, uniting it with
Syria, the Crusader kingdoms were faced with a threat, and his nephew Saladin
reconquered most of the area in 1187, leaving the Crusaders holding a few
ports. In the Third Crusade armies from Europe failed to recapture Jerusalem,
though Crusader states lingered for several decades, and other crusades
followed. The Christian Reconquista continued in Al-Andalus, and was eventually
completed with the fall of Granada in 1492. During the low period of the
Crusades, the Fourth Crusade was diverted from the Levant and instead took
Constantinople, leaving the Eastern Roman Empire (now the Byzantine Empire)
further weakened in their long struggle against the Turkish peoples to the
east. However, the crusaders did manage to damage Islamic caliphates;
preventing them from further expansion into Christendom and targets of the
Mamluks and the Mongols. Ayyubid dynasty. The Ayyubid dynasty was founded by
Saladin and centered in Egypt. In 1174, Saladin proclaimed himself Sultan and
conquered the Near East region. The Ayyubids ruled much of the Middle East
during the 12th and 13th centuries, controlling Egypt, Syria, northern
Mesopotamia, Hejaz, Yemen, and the North African coast up to the borders of
modern-day Tunisia. After Saladin, his sons contested control over the
sultanate, but Saladin's brother al-Adil eventually established himself in
1200. In the 1230s, Syria's Ayyubid rulers attempted to win independence from
Egypt and remained divided until Egyptian Sultan as-Salih Ayyub restored
Ayyubid unity by taking over most of Syria, excluding Aleppo, by 1247. In 1250,
the dynasty in the Egyptian region was overthrown by slave regiments. A number
of attempts to recover it failed, led by an-Nasir Yusuf of Aleppo. In 1260, the
Mongols sacked Aleppo and wrested control of what remained of the Ayyubid
territories soon after. Mongol invasions. After the Crusades the Mongols
invaded in the 13th century, marking the end of the Islamic Golden Age. Some
historians assert that the eastern Islamic world never fully recovered. Under
the leadership of Genghis Khan, The Mongols ended to the Abbasid era. The
Mongol invasion of Central Asia began in 1219 at a huge cost in civilian life
and economic devastation. The Mongols spread throughout Central Asia and
Persia: the Persian city of Isfahan had fallen to them by 1237. With the
election of Khan Mongke in 1251, Mongol targeted the Abbasid capital, Baghdad.
Mongke's brother, Hulegu, was made leader of the Mongol Army assigned to the
task of subduing Baghdad. The fall of Bagdhad in 1258 destroyed what had been
the largest city in Islam. The last Abbasid caliph, al-Musta'sim, was captured
and killed; and Baghdad was ransacked and destroyed. The cities of Damascus and
Aleppo fell in 1260. Plans for the conquest of Egypt were delayed due to the
death of Mongke at around the same time. The Abbasid army lost to the superior
Mongol army, but the invaders were finally stopped by Egyptian Mamluks north of
Jerusalem in 1260. Ultimately, the Ilkhanate, Golden Horde, and the Chagatai
Khanate - three of the four principal Mongol khanates - embraced Islam. In
power in Syria, Mesopotamia, Persia and further east, over the rest of the 13th
century gradually all converted to Islam. Most Ilkhanid rulers were replaced by
the new Mongol power founded by Timur (himself a Muslim), who conquered Persia
in the 1360s, and moved against the Delhi Sultanate in India and the Ottoman
Turks in Anatolia. His invasions were equally destructive, sacking Bagdhad,
Damascus, Delhi and many other cities, with enormous loss of life. Timur had
attacked areas still recovering from the Black Death, which may have killed one
third of the population of the Middle East. The plague began in China, and
reached Alexandria in Egypt in 1347, spreading over the following years to most
Islamic areas. The combination of the plague and the wars left the Middle
Eastern Islamic world in a seriously weakened position. The Timurid dynasty
would found had many branches of Islam, including the Mughals of India. The
Mamluks. In 1250, the Ayyubid Egyptian dynasty was overthrown by slave
regiments, and the Mamluk Sultanate was born. In the 1260s, the Mongols sacked
and control the Islamic Near East territories. The Mamluks, who were Turkic,
forced out the Mongols (see Battle of Ain Jalut) after the final destruction of
the Ayyubid dynasty. Thus they united Syria and Egypt for the longest interval
between the Abbasid and Ottoman empires (1250‚Äì1517). The Mamluks experienced
a continual state of political conflict, military tension, proxy wars, and
economic competition between the "Muslim territory" (Dar al-Islam) and "non-
Muslim territory" (Dar al-Harb). As part of their chosen role as defenders of
Islamic orthodoxy, the Mamluks sponsored many religious buildings, including
mosques, madrasas and khanqahs. Though some construction took place in the
provinces, the vast bulk of these projects expanded the capital. Many Mamluk
buildings in Cairo survive, particularly in Old Cairo. Bahri Sultans. A former
Mamluk slave who was born a prince, Aybak (known as "Lion of Ain Jaloot")
replaced the Mamluks in 1250. Aybak, by then a general, married Shajar al-Durr,
the widow of Ayyubid caliph al-Salih Ayyub. Military prestige was at the center
of Mamluk society, and it played a key role in the confrontations with the
Mongol forces. After Aybak's assassination and the accession of Qutuz in 1259,
the Mamluks challenged and routed the Mongols at the Battle of Ain Jalut in
late 1260. The Mongols were again defeated by the Mamluks at the Battle of Hims
a few months later, and then driven out of Syria altogether. With this, the
Mamluks were able to concentrate their forces and to conquer the last of the
crusader territories in the Levant. Burji Sultans. The global Muslim population
had reached about 8 per cent of the world total as against the Christian
population of 14 per cent by 1400. Africa. The Umayyad conquest of North Africa
continued the century of rapid Muslim military expansion following the death of
Muhammad in 632. By 640 the Arabs controlled Mesopotamia, had invaded Armenia,
and were concluding their conquest of Byzantine Syria. Damascus was the seat of
the Umayyad caliphate. By the end of 641 all of Egypt was in Arab hands. Horn
of Africa. The history of Islam in the Horn of Africa is almost as old as the
faith itself. Through extensive trade and social interactions with their
converted Muslim trading partners on the other side of the Red Sea, in the
Arabian peninsula, merchants and sailors in the Horn region gradually came
under the influence of the new religion. Early Islamic disciples fled to the
port city of Zeila in modern-day northern Somalia to seek protection from the
Quraysh at the court of the Aksumite Emperor in present-day Somalia. Some of
the Muslims that were granted protection are said to have then settled in
several parts of the Horn region to promote the religion. The victory of the
Muslims over the Quraysh in the 7th century had a significant impact on local
merchants and sailors, as their trading partners in Arabia had by then all
adopted Islam, and the major trading routes in the Mediterranean and the Red
Sea came under the sway of the Muslim Caliphs. Instability in the Arabian
peninsula saw further migrations of early Muslim families to the Somali
seaboard. These clans came to serve as catalysts, forwarding the faith to large
parts of the Horn region. Maghreb. Kairouan in Tunisia was the first city
founded by Muslims in the Maghreb. Arab general Uqba ibn Nafi erected the city
(in 670) and, in the same time, the Great Mosque of Kairouan considered as the
oldest and most prestigious sanctuary in the western Islamic world. This part
of Islamic territory has had independent governments during most of Islamic
history. The Idrisid were the first Arab rulers in the western Maghreb
(Morocco), ruling from 788 to 985. The dynasty is named after its first sultan
Idris I. The Almoravid dynasty was a Berber dynasty from the Sahara flourished
over a wide area of North-Western Africa and the Iberian Peninsula during the
11th century. Under this dynasty the Moorish empire was extended over present-
day Morocco, Western Sahara, Mauritania, Gibraltar, Tlemcen (in Algeria) and a
part of what is now Senegal and Mali in the south, and Spain and Portugal in
the north. The Almohad Dynasty or "the Unitarians", were a Berber Muslim
religious power which founded the fifth Moorish dynasty in the 12th century,
and conquered all Northern Africa as far as Egypt, together with Al-Andalus.
Great Lakes. Islam came to the Great Lakes region of South Eastern Africa along
existing trade routes. They learned from them the manners of the Muslims and
this led to their conversion by the Muslim Arabs. Local Islamic governments
centered in Tanzania (then Zanzibar). The people of "Zayd" were Muslims that
immigrated to the Great Lakes region. In the pre-colonial period, the structure
of Islamic authority here was held up through the "Ulema" ("wanawyuonis", in
Swahili language). These leaders had some degree of authority over most of the
Muslims in South East Africa before territorial boundaries were established.
The chief Qadi there was recognized for having the final religious authority.
West Africa. Much later, Usman dan Fodio after the Fulani War, found himself in
command of the largest state in Africa, the Fulani Empire. Dan Fodio worked to
establish an efficient government grounded in Islamic laws. Already aged at the
beginning of the war, he retired in 1815 passing the title of Sultan of Sokoto
to his son Muhammed Bello. Asia and the Far East. South Asia. On the Indian
subcontinent, Islam first appeared in the southwestern tip of the peninsula, in
today's Kerala state. Arabs traded with Malabar even before the birth of
Muhammad. Native legends say that a group of Sahaba, under Malik Ibn Deenar,
arrived on the Malabar Coast and preached Islam. According to that legend, the
first mosque of India was built by Second Chera King Cheraman Perumal, who
accepted Islam and received the name "Tajudheen". He traveled to Arabia to meet
Muhammad and died on the trip back, somewhere in today's Oman. Historical
records suggest that the Cheraman Perumal Mosque was built in Hijra 5 (629).
Islamic rule came to India in the 8th century, when Muhammad bin Qasim
conquered Sindh. Muslim conquests expanded under Mahmud and the Ghaznavids
until the late 12th century, when the Ghurids overran the Ghaznavids and
extended the conquests in Northern India. Qutb-ud-din Aybak conquered Delhi in
1206 and began the reign of the Delhi Sultanates. In the 14th century, Alauddin
Khilji extended Muslim rule south to Gujarat, Rajasthan and Deccan. Various
other Muslim dynasties also formed and ruled across India from the 13th to the
18th century such as the Qutb Shahi and the Bahmani, but none rivalled the
power and extensive reach of the Mughal Empire at its peak. China. In China,
four Sahabas (Sa'ad ibn abi Waqqas, Wahb Abu Kabcha, Jafar ibn Abu Talib and
Jahsh) preached in 616/17 and onwards after following the
Chittagong‚ÄìKamrup‚ÄìManipur route after sailing from Abyssinia in 615/16.
After conquering Persia in 636, Sa'ad ibn abi Waqqas went with Sa'id ibn Zaid,
Qais ibn Sa'd and Hassan ibn Thabit to China in 637 taking the complete Quran.
Sa'ad ibn abi Waqqas headed for China for the third time in 650-51 after Caliph
Uthman asked him to lead an embassy to China, which the Chinese emperor
received. Southeast Asia. Many of historian predict that Islam reached South
East Asia, espescially western part of Indonesia Archipelago on the 13th
Century. But, More than Two Thousands years ago Arab traders from Yaman had
been connected to other far east Asia through trading and traveling by sea. The
trader from Arab is the intermediary trader between Europe to African, Indian,
South East Asian, and Far East Asian, including Japan and China. They were not
just sold goods from Arab, but also goods from Africa, India, and so on, such
as ivory, fragrance, spice, seasoning, gold, etc. Islam first reached the
islands of Southeast Asia through traders from Mecca still during the first
century of the Islamic calendar (the 7th century). There are many strong
possibility that Islam had been spread by Arab traders to South East Asia in
the 1st Century of Islamic Calendar or 7th Century of Christian/Gregorian
Calendar. This Fact is much stronger, according to T.W. Arnold in The Preaching
of Islam - In the 2nd Century of Islamic Calendar (Hijri), Arab trader had been
trade to Ceylon or Srilangka (island in southern part of India). The same
argument has been told by Prof.Dr. B.H. Burger and Prof.Dr.Mr. Prajudi in
"Sedjarah Ekonomis Sosiologis Indonesia" (History of Socio Economic of
Indonesia) There are more possibility that Islam was spread by Arab Traders to
South East Asia. According to Al Biruni, the Muslim Scholar Geographical
Experty, 973 - 1048 AD, in his World Atlas written that Indian or Indonesia
Ocean used to be call as Persian Ocean. After the Western Imperialist ruled, it
is replaced Persian Ocean to be Indian Ocean. Soon, many Sufi missionaries
translated classical Sufi literature from Arabic and Persian into Malay.
Coupled with the composing of original Islamic literature in Malay, this led
the way to the transformation of Malay into an Islamic language. By 1292, when
Marco Polo visited Sumatra, most of the inhabitants had converted to Islam. The
Sultanate of Malacca was founded by Parameswara, a Srivijayan Prince in the
Malay peninsula. Through trade and commerce, Islam spread to Borneo and Java,
Indonesia. By the late 15th century, Islam had been introduced to the
Philippines. As Islam spread from 7th Century AD, the social changes had been
developed, from the individual faith changes to society changes. Soon, after
five centuries of mingled and interraced with assimilation and acculturation
with the native south east Asia society, Islam was emerged as political power
in the region. So, as Islam spread, three main Muslim political powers emerged.
Aceh, the most important Muslim power, was based in Northern Sumatra. It
controlled much of the area between Southeast Asia and India. The Sultanate
also attracted Sufi poets. The second Muslim power was the Sultanate of Malacca
on the Malay peninsula. The Sultanate of Demak was the third power, appearing
in Java, where the emerging Muslim forces defeated the local Majapahit kingdom
in the early 16th century. Although the sultanate managed to expand its
territory somewhat, its rule remained brief. Portuguese forces captured Malacca
in 1511 under the naval general Afonso de Albuquerque. With Malacca subdued,
the Aceh Sultanate and Brunei established themselves as centers of Islam in
Southeast Asia. Brunei's sultanate remains intact even to this day.
Fragmentation period. Three Early Modern empires. In the 15th and 16th
centuries three major Muslim empires formed: the Ottoman Empire in the Middle
East, the Balkans and Northern Africa; the Safavid Empire in Greater Iran; and
the Mughul Empire in South Asia. These imperial powers were made possible by
the discovery and exploitation of gunpowder and more efficient administration.
By the end of the 19th century, all three had declined, and by the early 20th
century, with the Ottomans' defeat in World War I, the last Muslim empire
collapsed. Dar al-'Ahd (House of truce) began to develop in the Ottoman
Empire's relationship with its tributary states. In the contemporary "National
period", the term referred to non-Muslim governments that had armistice or
peace agreements with Muslim governments. Today, the actual status of the non-
Muslim country in question may vary from acknowledged equality to tributary
states. Mughal Empire. The Mughal Empire was a product of various Central Asian
invasions into the Indian subcontinent. It was founded by the Timurid prince
Babur in 1526 with the destruction of the Delhi sultanate, placing its capital
in Agra. Babur's death some years later and the indecisive rule of his son,
Humayun, brought instability to Mughal rule. The resistance of the Afghani Sher
Shah, who administered a string of defeats to Humayun, weakened the empire. A
year before his death, however, Humayun managed to recover much of the lost
territories, leaving a substantial legacy for his son, the 13 year old Akbar
(later known as "Akbar the Great"), in 1556. Under Akbar, consolidation of the
Mughal Empire occurred through both expansion and administrative reforms. After
Akbar, Jahangir and Shah Jahan came to power. Subsequently, Aurangazeb ruled
vast areas including Afghanisthan, Pakistan, India and Bangladesh. The empire
ruled most of present-day India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan for
several centuries. Its decline in the early 18th century allowed India to be
divided into smaller kingdoms and states. The Mughal dynasty was dissolved by
the British Empire after the Indian rebellion of 1857. It left a lasting legacy
on Indian culture and architecture. Famous buildings built by the Mughals,
include: the Taj Mahal, the Red Fort, the Badshahi Mosque, the Lahore Fort, the
Shalimar Gardens and the Agra Fort. During the empire's reign, Muslim
communities flourished all over India, in Gujarat, Bengal and Hyderabad.
Various Sufi orders from Afghanistan and Persia were active throughout the
region. More than a quarter of the population converted to Islam. Safavid
Empire. The Safavids dynasty from Azarbaijan ruled from 1501 to 1736, and which
established Twelver Shi'a Islam as the region's official religion and united
its provinces under a single sovereignty, thereby reigniting the Persian
identity.  Ottoman Empire. The Seljuq Turks declined in the second half of the
13th century, after the Mongol invasion. This resulted in the establishment of
multiple Turkish principalities, known as beyliks. Osman I, the founder of the
Ottoman dynasty, assumed leadership of one of these principalities (S√∂ƒü√ºt)
in 1281, succeeding his father Ertuƒürul. Declaring an independent Ottoman
emirate in 1299, Osman I afterwards led it in a series of battles with the
Byzantine Empire. By 1331, the Ottomans had captured Nicaea, the former
Byzantine capital, under the leadership of Osman's son and successor, Orhan I.
Victory at the Battle of Kosovo against the Serbs in 1389 then facilitated
their expansion into Europe. The Ottomans were established in the Balkans and
Anatolia by the time Bayezid I ascended to power in the same year, now at the
helm of a growing empire. Growth halted when Mongol warlord Timur (also known
as ""Tamerlane"") captured Bayezid I in the Battle of Ankara in 1402, beginning
the Ottoman Interregnum. This episode was characterized by the division of the
Ottoman territory amongst Bayezid I's sons, who submitted to Timurid authority.
When a number of Ottoman territories regained independent status, ruin for the
Empire loomed. However, the empire recovered, as the youngest son of Bayezid I,
Mehmed I, waged offensive campaigns against his ruling brothers, thereby
reuniting Asia Minor and declaring himself sultan in 1413. Around this time the
Ottoman naval fleet developed, such that they were able to challenge Venice, a
naval power. They also attempted to reconquer the Balkans. By the time of
Mehmed I's grandson, Mehmed II (ruled 1444 ‚Äî 1446; 1451 ‚Äî 1481), the
Ottomans could lay siege to Constantinople, the capital of Byzantium. A factor
in this siege was the use of muskets and large cannons introduced by the
Ottomans. The Byzantine fortress succumbed in 1453, after 54 days of siege.
Mehmed II renamed it "Istanbul". Without its capital the Byzantine Empire
disintegrated. The future successes of the Ottomans and later empires would
depend upon the exploitation of gunpowder. In the early 16th century, the
Shi'ite Safavid dynasty assumed control in Persia under the leadership of Shah
Ismail I, defeating the ruling Turcoman federation Aq Qoyunlu (also called the
"White Sheep Turkomans") in 1501. The Ottoman sultan Selim I sought to repel
Safavid expansion, challenging and defeating them at the Battle of Chaldiran in
1514. Selim I also deposed the ruling Mamluks in Egypt, absorbing their
territories in 1517. Suleiman I (also known as "Suleiman the Magnificent"),
Selim I's successor, took advantage of the diversion of Safavid focus to the
Uzbeks on the eastern frontier and recaptured Baghdad, which had fallen under
Safavid control. Despite this, Safavid power remained substantial, rivalling
the Ottomans. Suleiman I advanced deep into Hungary following the Battle of
Moh√°cs in 1526 ‚Äî reaching as far as the gates of Vienna thereafter, and
signed a Franco-Ottoman alliance with Francis I of France against Charles V of
the Roman Empire 10 years later. Suleiman I's rule (1520 ‚Äî 1566) was the apex
of the Ottoman Empire. The rapid European industrialization thereafter sent it
into a relative decline. Modern history. The modern age brought technological
and organizational changes to Europe while the Islamic region continued the
patterns of earlier centuries. The Great Powers globalized economically and
colonized much of the region. Ottoman Empire partition. By the end of the 19th
century, the Ottoman empire had declined. The decision to back Germany in World
War I meant they shared the Central Powers' defeat in that war. The defeat led
to the overthrow of the Ottomans by Turkish nationalists led by the victorious
general of the Battle of Gallipoli: Mustafa Kemal, who became known to his
people as Atat√ºrk, "Father of the Turks." Atat√ºrk was credited with
renegotiating the treaty of S√®vres (1920) which ended Turkey's involvement in
the war and establishing the modern Republic of Turkey, which was recognized by
the Allies in the Treaty of Lausanne (1923). Atat√ºrk went on to implement an
ambitious program of modernization that emphasized economic development and
secularization. He transformed Turkish culture to reflect European laws,
adopted Hindu-Arabic numerals, the Latin script, separated the religious
establishment from the state, and emancipated woman‚Äîeven giving them the
right to vote in parallel with women's suffrage in the west. Following World
War I, the vast majority of former Ottoman territory outside of Asia Minor was
handed over to the victorious European powers as protectorates. During the war
the Allies had promised the subject peoples independence in exchange for their
assistance fighting the Turkish powers. To their dismay, they found that this
system of "protectorates" was a smoke-screen for their continued subjugation by
the British and the French. The struggles for independence from their Turkish
overlords and the cooperation of partisan forces with the British were
romanticized in the stories of British secret intelligence agent T. E.
Lawrence‚Äîlater known as "Lawrence of Arabia." Ottoman successor states
include today's Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Egypt, Greece, Iraq,
Lebanon, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Syria, Jordan, Turkey, Balkan states,
North Africa and the north shore of the Black Sea. Many Muslim countries sought
to adopt European political organization and nationalism began to emerge in the
Muslim world. Countries like Egypt, Syria and Turkey organized their
governments sought to develop national pride amongst their citizens. Other
places, like Iraq, were not as successful due to a lack of unity and an
inability to resolve age-old prejudices between Muslim sects and against non-
Muslims. Some Muslim countries, such as Turkey and Egypt, sought to separate
Islam from the secular government. In other cases, such as Saudi Arabia, the
government brought out religious expression in the re-emergence of the
puritanical form of Sunni Islam known to its detractors as Wahabism, which
found its way into the Saudi royal family. Indian partition. The "partition of
India" refers to the creation in August 1947 of the now sovereign states of
India and Pakistan. The two nations were formed out of the former British Raj,
including treaty states, when Britain granted independence to the area (see
Undivided India). In particular, the term refers to the partition of Bengal and
Punjab, the two main provinces of what would be Pakistan. In 1947, after the
partition of India, Pakistan became the largest Islamic country in the world
(by population) and the tenth largest post-World War II state in the modern
world. In 1971, after a bloody war of independence, the Bengal part of Pakistan
became an independent state called Bangladesh. Pakistan in the contemporary era
is the second largest Islamic country in the world, following Indonesia.
Pakistan is the only nuclear power among predominantly Muslim nations. Post-
1945 era. Between 1953 and 1964, King Saud reorganized the government of the
monarchy his father, Ibn Saud, had created. Saudi Arabia's ministries included
Communication (1953), Agriculture and Water (1953), Petroleum (1960),
Pilgrimage and Islamic Endowments (1960), Labour and Social Affairs (1962) and
Information (1963). He also put Talal, one of his many younger brothers (29
years his junior) in charge of the Ministry of Transport. In 1958-59, Talal
proposed the formation of a National Council. As he proposed it, it would have
been a consultative body, not a legislature. Still, he thought of it as a first
step toward broader popular participation in the government. Talal presented
this proposal to the king when the Crown Prince was out of the country. Saud
forwarded the proposal to the ulama asking them whether a National Council was
a legitimate institution in Islam. The idea then disappeared until it was
revived more than three decades later. A Consultative Council came into
existence in 1992. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries came into
existence in 1960. For the first decade or more of its existence, it was unable
to increase revenue for the member nations. Tension between Faisal and Saud
continued to mount until a showdown in 1964. Saud threatened to mobilize the
Royal Guard against Faisal and Faisal threatened to mobilize the National Guard
against Saud. Saud then abdicated and left for Cairo, then Greece, where he
would die in 1969. Faisal then became King. The Six-Day War of June 5‚Äì10,
1967, was fought between Israel and the neighbouring states of Egypt, Jordan,
and Syria. It closed the Suez canal, and may have contributed to the revolution
in Libya that put Muammar al-Gaddafi in power. It led in May 1970 to the
closure of the "tapline" from Saudi Arabia through Syria to Lebanon. These
developments had the effect of increasing the importance of petroleum in Libya,
which is a short (and canal-free) shipping distance from Europe. In 1970,
Occidental Petroleum broke with other oil companies and accepted Qaddafi's
demands for price increases. In October 1973, another war between Israel and
its Muslim neighbors, known as the Yom Kippur War, broke out just as oil
company began meeting with OPEC leaders. OPEC had been emboldened by the
success of Libya's demands and the war strengthened their unity. The Arab
defeats in 1967 and 1973 triggered the 1973 oil crisis. In response to the
emergency resupply effort by the West that enabled Israel to defeat Egyptian
and Syrian forces, the Arab world imposed the 1973 oil embargo against the
United States and Western Europe. Faisal agreed that Saudi Arabia would use
some of its oil wealth to finance the "front-line states", those that bordered
Israel, in their struggle. The centrality of petroleum, the Arab-Israeli
Conflict and political and economic instability and uncertainty remain constant
features of the politics of the region. Persian revolutions. The Iranian
Constitutional Revolution took place between 1905 and 1911. The revolution
marked the beginning of the end of Iran's feudalistic society and led to the
establishment of a parliament in Persia and the restriction of the power of the
Shah (king). Iran approved its first constitution at this time. The modernist
and conservative blocks then began to fight with each other. World War I
intervened and all of the combatants invaded Iran. This weakened the government
and threatened the country's independence. The constitutional monarchy created
by the decree of Mozzafar al-Din Shah that was established in Persia as a
result of the Revolution, was damaged in 1925 with the dissolution of the Qajar
dynasty and the ascension of Reza Shah Pahlavi to the throne. In 1979 the
Iranian Revolution transformed Iran from a constitutional monarchy, under Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, to a populist theocratic Islamic republic under the rule
of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, a Shi`i Muslim cleric and "marja". Following
the Revolution, and a new constitution was approved and a referendum
established the government, electing Ruhollah Khomeini as Supreme Leader.
During the following two years, liberals, leftists, and Islamic groups fought
each other, and the Islamics captured power. At the same time, the U.S., the
USSR, and most of the Arab governments of the Middle East feared that their
dominance in the region would be challenged by the Islamic ideology, so they
encouraged and supported Saddam Hussein to invade Iran, which resulted in the
Iran-Iraq war. National period. Arab-Israeli conflict. The Arab-Israeli
conflict spans about a century of political tensions and open hostilities. It
involves the establishment of the modern State of Israel as a Jewish nation
state, the consequent displacement of the Palestinian people, as well as the
adverse relationship between the Arab nations and the state of Israel (see
related Israeli-Palestinian conflict). Despite at first involving only the Arab
states bordering Israel, animosity has also developed between other Muslim
nations and Israel. Many countries, individuals and non-governmental
organizations elsewhere in the world feel involved in this conflict for reasons
such as cultural and religious ties with Islam, Arab culture, Christianity,
Judaism, Jewish culture or for ideological, human rights, or strategic reasons.
While some consider the Arab-Israeli conflict a part of (or a precursor to) a
wider clash of civilizations between the Western World and the Arab or Muslim
world, others oppose this view. Animosity emanating from this conflict has
caused numerous attacks on supporters (or perceived supporters) of each side by
supporters of the other side in many countries around the world. Anatolian
region. Since the establishment of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, there has
been a strong tradition of secularism in Turkey established and
institutionalized by Atat√ºrk's Reforms. Although the First Grand National
Assembly of Turkey had rallied support from the population for the Independence
War against the occupying forces on behalf of Islamic principles, Islam was
omitted from the public sphere after the Independence War. The principle of
secularism was thus inserted in the Turkish Constitution as late as 1937. This
legal action was assisted by stringent state policies against domestic Islamist
groups and establishments to neutralize the strong appeal of Islam in Turkish
society. Even though an overwhelming majority of the population, at least
nominally, adheres to Islam in Turkey, the state, which was established with
the Kemalist ideology has no official religion nor promotes any and it monitors
the area between the religions using the Presidency of Religious Affairs. The
Republic Protests were a series of mass rallies by Turkish secular citizens
that took place in Turkey in 2007. The target of the first protest was the
possible presidential candidacy of the Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan,
afraid that if elected President of Turkey Erdoƒüan would alter the Turkish
secularist state. Arab Spring. In the Near East and North Africa, a series of
protests and demonstrations calling for democracy and freedom across the region
became known as the Arab Spring. The protests, uprisings and revolutions
brought about the overthrow of the Tunisian and Egyptian governments. The
period of political liberalization also affected countries that were not part
of the Arab world. References and further reading. Books, articles, and
