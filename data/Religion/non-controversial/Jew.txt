Jews The Jews ( ISO 259-3 Israeli pronunciation ), also known as the Jewish
people, are a nation and an ethnoreligious group, originating in the Israelites
or Hebrews of the Ancient Near East. The Jewish ethnicity, nationality, and
religion are strongly interrelated, as Judaism is the traditional faith of the
Jewish nation. Converts to Judaism, whose status as Jews within the Jewish
ethnos is equal to those born into it, have been absorbed into the Jewish
people throughout the millennia. In Jewish tradition, Jewish ancestry is traced
to the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the second millennium
BCE. The modern State of Israel defines itself as a Jewish state in its Basic
Laws, and Israel's Law of Return states: "Every Jew has the right to come to
this country as an oleh." Israel is the only country where Jews are a majority
of the population. Jews achieved political autonomy twice before in ancient
history. The first of these periods lasted from 1350 to 586 BCE, and
encompassed the periods of the Judges, the United Monarchy, and the Divided
Monarchy of the Kingdoms of Israel and Judah, ending with the destruction of
the First Temple. The second was the period of the Hasmonean Kingdom spanning
from 140 to 37 BCE. Since the destruction of the First Temple, most Jews have
lived in diaspora. A minority in every country in which they live (except
Israel), they have frequently experienced persecution throughout history,
resulting in a population that has fluctuated both in numbers and distribution
over the centuries. , the world Jewish population was estimated at 13.4 million
by the North American Jewish Data Bank, or less than 0.2% of the total world
population (roughly one in every 514 people). According to this report, about
42.5% of all Jews reside in Israel (5.7 million), and 39.3% in the United
States (5.3 million), with most of the remainder living in Europe (1.5 million)
and Canada (0.4 million). These numbers include all those who consider
themselves Jews, whether or not they are affiliated with a Jewish organization.
The total world Jewish population, however, is difficult to measure. In
addition to issues with census methodology, there are "halakhic" disputes
regarding who is a Jew and secular, political, and ancestral identification
factors that may affect the figure considerably. Name and etymology. The
English word "Jew" continues Middle English ', a loan from Old French ',
earlier ', ultimately from Latin '. The Latin ' simply means "Judaean", "from
the land of "Judaea"". The Latin term itself, like the corresponding Greek , is
a loan from Aramaic ', corresponding to , "Yehudi" (sg.); , "Yehudim" (pl.), in
origin the term for a member of the tribe of Judah or the people of the kingdom
of Judah. The name of both the tribe and kingdom derive from Judah, the fourth
son of Jacob. The Hebrew word for Jew, ISO 259-3 Yhudi, is pronounced , with
the stress on the final syllable, in Israeli Hebrew, in its basic form. The
Ladino name is , "Djudio" (sg.); , "Djudios" (pl.); Yiddish: "Yid" (sg.); ,
"Yidn" (pl.). The etymological equivalent is in use in other languages, e.g.,
"Yahoud"/"Yahoudi" () in Arabic language, "Jude" in German, "judeu" in
Portuguese, "juif" in French, "jÃ¸de" in Danish and Norwegian, "judÃ­o" in
Spanish, "jood" in Dutch, etc., but derivations of the word "Hebrew" are also
in use to describe a Jew, e.g., in Italian ("Ebreo"), in Persian ("Ebri/Ebrani"
()) and Russian ("Ð•Ð²Ñ€ÐµÐ¹, Yevrey"). The German word "Jude" is pronounced ,
the corresponding adjective "jÃ¼disch" (Jewish) is the origin of the word
"Yiddish". (See Jewish ethnonyms for a full overview.)  Origins. According to
the Hebrew Bible, all Israelites descend from Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Abraham
was born in the Sumerian city of Ur KaÅ›dim, and migrated to Canaan (commonly
known as the Land of Israel) with his family. Aristotle believed that the Jews
came from India, where he said that they were known as the "Kalani". Genetic
studies on Jews show that most Jews worldwide bear a common genetic heritage
which originates in the Middle East, and that they bear their strongest
resemblance to the peoples of the Fertile Crescent. According to some Biblical
archaeologists, however, Israelite culture did not overtake the region, but
rather grew out of Canaanite culture. Judaism. Judaism guides its adherents in
both practice and belief, and has been called not only a religion, but also a
"way of life," which has made drawing a clear distinction between Judaism,
Jewish culture, and Jewish identity rather difficult. Throughout history, in
eras and places as diverse as the ancient Hellenic world, in Europe before and
after The Age of Enlightenment (see Haskalah), in Islamic Spain and Portugal,
in North Africa and the Middle East, India, and China, or the contemporary
United States and Israel, cultural phenomena have developed that are in some
sense characteristically Jewish without being at all specifically religious.
Some factors in this come from within Judaism, others from the interaction of
Jews or specific communities of Jews with their surroundings, others from the
inner social and cultural dynamics of the community, as opposed to from the
religion itself. This phenomenon has led to considerably different Jewish
cultures unique to their own communities, each as authentically Jewish as the
next. Who is a Jew? Judaism shares some of the characteristics of a nation, an
ethnicity, a religion, and a culture, making the definition of who is a Jew
vary slightly depending on whether a religious or national approach to identity
is used. Generally, in modern secular usage, Jews include three groups: people
who were born to a Jewish family regardless of whether or not they follow the
religion; those who have some Jewish ancestral background or lineage (sometimes
including those who do not have strictly matrilineal descent); and people
without any Jewish ancestral background or lineage who have formally converted
to Judaism and therefore are followers of the religion. Historical definitions
of Jewish identity have traditionally been based on "halakhic" definitions of
matrilineal descent, and halakhic conversions. Historical definitions of who is
a Jew date back to the codification of the Oral Torah into the Babylonian
Talmud. Interpretations of sections of the Tanakh, such as Deuteronomy 7:1â€“5,
by learned Jewish sages, are used as a warning against intermarriage between
Jews and Canaanites because "non-Jewish husband will cause your child to turn
away from Me and they will worship the gods (i.e., idols) of others." Leviticus
24:10 says that the son in a marriage between a Hebrew woman and an Egyptian
man is "of the community of Israel." This is complemented by Ezra 10:2â€“3,
where Israelites returning from Babylon vow to put aside their gentile wives
and their children. Since the "Haskalah", these "halakhic" interpretations of
Jewish identity have been challenged. At times, conversion has accounted for a
substantial part of Jewish population growth. In the first century of the
Christian era, for example, the population more than doubled, from four to
8â€“10 million within the confines of the Roman Empire, in good part as a
result of a wave of conversion. Ethnic divisions. Within the world's Jewish
population there are distinct ethnic divisions, most of which are primarily the
result of geographic branching from an originating Israelite population, and
subsequent independent evolutions. An array of Jewish communities were
established by Jewish settlers in various places around the Old World, often at
great distances from one another resulting in effective and often long-term
isolation from each other. During the millennia of the Jewish diaspora the
communities would develop under the influence of their local environments;
political, cultural, natural, and populational. Today, manifestation of these
differences among the Jews can be observed in Jewish cultural expressions of
each community, including Jewish linguistic diversity, culinary preferences,
liturgical practices, religious interpretations, as well as degrees and sources
of genetic admixture. Jews are often identified as belonging to one of two
major groups: the "Ashkenazim", or "Germanics" (Ashkenaz meaning "Germany" in
Medieval Hebrew, denoting their Central European base), and the "Sephardim", or
"Hispanics" (Sefarad meaning "Spain/Hispania" or "Iberia" in Hebrew, denoting
their Spanish, and Portuguese, base). The "Mizrahim", or "Easterners" (Mizrach
being "East" in Hebrew), that is, the diverse collection of Middle Eastern and
North African Jews, constitute a third major group, although they are sometimes
termed "Sephardi" for liturgical reasons. Smaller groups include, but are not
restricted to, Indian Jews such as the Bene Israel, Bnei Menashe, Cochin Jews,
and Bene Ephraim; the Romaniotes of Greece; the Italian Jews ("Italkim" or
"BenÃ© Roma"); the Teimanim from Yemen and Oman; various African Jews,
including most numerously the Beta Israel of Ethiopia; and Chinese Jews, most
notably the Kaifeng Jews, as well as various other distinct but now almost
extinct communities. The divisions between all these groups are approximate and
their boundaries are not always clear. The Mizrahim for example, are a
heterogeneous collection of North African, Central Asian, Caucasian, and Middle
Eastern Jewish communities that are often as unrelated to each other as they
are to any of the earlier mentioned Jewish groups. In modern usage, however,
the Mizrahim are sometimes termed "Sephardi" due to similar styles of liturgy,
despite independent development from Sephardim proper. Thus, among Mizrahim
there are Egyptian Jews, Iraqi Jews, Lebanese Jews, Kurdish Jews, Libyan Jews,
Syrian Jews, Bukharian Jews, Mountain Jews, Georgian Jews, Iranian Jews and
various others. The Teimanim from Yemen and Oman are sometimes included,
although their style of liturgy is unique and they differ in respect to the
admixture found among them to that found in Mizrahim. In addition, there is a
differentiation made between Sephardi migrants who established themselves in
the Middle East and North Africa after the expulsion of the Jews from Spain and
Portugal in the 1490s and the pre-existing Jewish communities in those regions.
Despite this diversity, Ashkenazi Jews represent the bulk of modern Jewry, with
at least 70% of Jews worldwide (and up to 90% prior to World War II and the
Holocaust). As a result of their emigration from Europe, Ashkenazim also
represent the overwhelming majority of Jews in the New World continents, in
countries such as the United States, Canada, Argentina, Australia, and Brazil.
In France, emigration of Jews from North Africa has led them to outnumber the
Ashkenazim . Only in Israel is the Jewish population representative of all
groups, a melting pot independent of each group's proportion within the overall
world Jewish population. Languages. Hebrew is the liturgical language of
Judaism (termed "l'shon ha-kodesh", "the holy tongue"), the language in which
the Hebrew scriptures (Tanakh) were composed, and the daily speech of the
Jewish people for centuries. By the 5th century BCE, Aramaic, a closely related
tongue, joined Hebrew as the spoken language in Judea. By the third century
BCE, Jews of the diaspora were speaking Greek. For centuries, Jews worldwide
have spoken the local or dominant languages of the regions they migrated to,
often developing distinctive dialectal forms or branches that became
independent languages. Yiddish is the JudÃ¦o-German language developed by
Ashkenazi Jews who migrated to Central Europe. Ladino is the JudÃ¦o-Spanish
language developed by Sephardic Jews who migrated to the Iberian peninsula. Due
to many factors, including the impact of the Holocaust on European Jewry, the
Jewish exodus from Arab lands, and widespread emigration from other Jewish
communities around the world, ancient and distinct Jewish languages of several
communities, including JudÃ¦o-Georgian, JudÃ¦o-Arabic, JudÃ¦o-Berber, Krymchak,
JudÃ¦o-Malayalam and many others, have largely fallen out of use. For over
sixteen centuries Hebrew was used almost exclusively as a liturgical language,
and as the language in which most books had been written on Judaism, with a few
speaking only Hebrew on the Sabbath. Hebrew was revived as a spoken language by
Eliezer ben Yehuda, who arrived in Palestine in 1881. It had not been used as a
mother tongue since Tannaic times. Modern Hebrew is now one of the two official
languages of the State of Israel along with Arabic. The three most commonly
spoken languages among Jews today are Hebrew, English and Russian. Some Romance
languages, such as French and Spanish, are also widely used. Yiddish has been
spoken by more Jews in history than any other language, but it is far less used
today, after the Holocaust and the adoption of Hebrew, first by the Zionist
movement, and then by Israel. Genetic studies. Genetic studies indicate various
lineages found in modern Jewish populations; however, most of these populations
share a lineage in common, traceable to an ancient population that underwent
geographic branching and subsequent independent evolutions. While DNA tests
have demonstrated both inter-marriage and conversion to Judaism in all of the
various Jewish ethnic divisions over the last 3,000 years, it was substantially
less than in other populations. The findings lend support to traditional Jewish
accounts accrediting their founding to exiled Israelite populations, and
counters theories that many or most of the world's Jewish populations were
founded entirely by local populations that adopted the Jewish religion, devoid
of any actual Israelite genetic input. DNA analysis further determined that
modern Jews of the priesthood tribeâ€”"Kohanim"â€”share an ancestor dating back
about 3,000 years. This result is consistent for all Jewish populations around
the world. The researchers estimated that the most recent common ancestor of
modern Kohanim lived between 1000 BCE (roughly the time of the Biblical Exodus)
and 586 BCE, when the Babylonians destroyed the First Temple. They found
similar results analyzing DNA from Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews. The scientists
estimated the date of the original priest based on genetic mutations, which
indicated that the priest lived roughly 106 generations ago, between 2,650 and
3,180 years ago depending whether one counts a generation as 25 or 30 years.
These Jews belong to the haplotypes J1e and J2a. However, more recent research
has shown that many ethnic groups in the Middle East and Mediterranean area
also share this genetic profile. Although individual and groups of converts to
Judaism have historically been absorbed into contemporary Jewish populations,
it is unlikely that they formed a large percentage of the ancestors of modern
Jewish groups, and much less that they represented their genesis as Jewish
communities. Biologist Robert Pollack stated in 2003 that one cannot determine
the biological "Jewishness" of an individual because "there are no DNA
sequences common to all Jews and absent from all non-Jews". A 2009 study was
able to genetically identify individuals with full or partial Ashkenazi Jewish
ancestry. Male lineages: Y chromosomal DNA. A study published by the National
Academy of Sciences found that "the paternal gene pools of Jewish communities
from Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East descended from a common Middle
Eastern ancestral population", and suggested that "most Jewish communities have
remained relatively isolated from neighboring non-Jewish communities during and
after the Diaspora". Researchers expressed surprise at the remarkable genetic
uniformity they found among modern Jews, no matter where the diaspora has
become dispersed around the world. Other Y-chromosome findings show that the
world's Jewish communities are closely related to Kurds, Turks and Armenians,
the hypothesis being that "Jews, Kurds, Armenians and Anatolian Turks all carry
the genetic markers of ancient indigenous populations of the Fertile Crescent,
while Palestinian Arabs and Beduin may largely descend from the Arab
conquerors". Skorecki and colleague wrote that "the extremely close affinity of
Jewish and non-Jewish Middle Eastern populations observed ... supports the
hypothesis of a common Middle Eastern origin". According to another study of
the same year, more than 70% of Jewish men and half of the Arab men
(inhabitants of Israel and the territories only) whose DNA was studied
inherited their Y-chromosomes from the same paternal ancestors who lived in the
region within the last few thousand years. The results are consistent with the
Biblical account of Jews and Arabs having a common ancestor. About two-thirds
of Israeli Arabs and Arabs in the territories and a similar proportion of
Israeli Jews are the descendants of at least three common ancestors who lived
in the Middle East in the Neolithic period. However, the Palestinian Arab clade
includes two Arab modal haplotypes which are found at only very low frequency
among Jews, reflecting divergence and/or large scale admixture from non-local
populations to the Palestinians. A study of haplotypes of the Y-chromosome,
published in 2000, addressed the paternal origins of Ashkenazi Jews. Hammer "et
al." found that the Y chromosome of some Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews contained
mutations that are also common among Middle Eastern peoples, but uncommon in
the general European population. This suggested that the male ancestors of the
Ashkenazi Jews could be traced mostly to the Middle East. The proportion of
male genetic admixture in Ashkenazi Jews amounts to less than 0.5% per
generation over an estimated 80 generations, with "relatively minor
contribution of European Y chromosomes to the Ashkenazim," and a total
admixture estimate "very similar to Motulsky's average estimate of 12.5%." This
supported the finding that "Diaspora Jews from Europe, Northwest Africa, and
the Near East resemble each other more closely than they resemble their non-
Jewish neighbors." However, when all haplotypes were included in the analysis,
m (the admixture percentage) increased to 23% Â± 7%. In addition, of the Jewish
populations in this cluster, the Ashkenazim were closest to South European
populations, specifically the Greeks, and to the Turks. In Jewish populations,
Haplogroup J1 (defined by the 267 marker) constitutes 30% of the Yemenite Jews
20.0% of the Ashkenazim results and 12% of the Sephardic results. However, J1
is most frequent in Yemen (76%),Yemen 45/62 = 72.6% J1-M267Qatar 42/72 = 58.3%
J1-M267 Saudi (64%), Qatar (58%). J1 is generally frequent amongst Negev
Bedouins (62%). It is also very common among other Arabs such as those of the
Levant, i.e. Palestinian (38.4%), Syria (30%), Lebanon (25%). In Europe, higher
frequencies have been reported in the central Adriatic regions of Italy:
Gargano (17.2%), Pescara (15%), in the Mediterranean Paola (11.1%) and in South
Sicilian Ragusa (10.7%). Fairly high frequencies have also been reported in
other nearby Mediterranean areas: Crete (8.3%),Crete 16 out of 193Greece 9 out
of 171 Malta (7.8%), Cyprus (6.2%), Greece (5.3%). Haplogroup J2 which is found
in the Sephardic Jews (29%) and Ashkenazi Jews (23%), or 19%. is found mainly
in the Fertile Crescent, the Caucasus, Anatolia, the Balkans, Italy, the
Mediterranean , the Iranian plateau, Central Asia, and South Asia. More
specifically, it is found in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Turkey, Israel, Palestine,
Greece, Italy and the eastern coasts of the Iberian Peninsula, and more
frequently in Iraqis 29.7%, Lebanese 25%, Palestinians 16.8%, Syrians 22.5%,
Kurds 28.4%, Saudi Arabia 15.92%, Jordan 14.3%, Oman 10â€“15%, UAE 10.4%, Yemen
9.7%, in Israel, in Palestine, and in Turkey. Female lineages: Mitochondrial
DNA. Before 2006, geneticists largely attributed the genesis of most of the
world's Jewish populations to founding acts by males who migrated from the
Middle East and "by the women from each local population whom they took as
wives and converted to Judaism", though no genetic relation was found between
Jewish and non Jewish female lineages. However, more recent findings of studies
of maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA, at least in Ashkenazi Jews, has led
to a review of this archetype. This research has suggested that, in addition to
Israelite male, significant female founder ancestry might also derive from the
Middle East-with 40% of Ashkenazim descended from four women lived about
1000â€“1500 years ago in the Middle East. In addition, Behar (2006) suggested
that the rest of Ashkenazi mtDNA is originated from about 150 women, most of
those were probably of Middle Eastern origin. Approximately 32% of people with
Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry belong to the mtDNA haplogroup K. This high
percentage points to a genetic bottleneck occurring some 100 generations ago.
Research in 2008 found significant founder effects in many non-Asheknazi Jewish
populations. In Belmonte, Azerbaijani, Georgian, Bene Israel and Libyan Jewish
communities "a single mother was sufficient to explain at least 40% of their
present-day mtDNA variation". In addition, "the Cochin and Tunisian Jewish
communities show an attenuated pattern with two founding mothers explaining
>30% of the variation." In contrast, Bulgarian, Turkish, Moroccan and Ethiopian
Jews were heterogeneous with no evidence "for a narrow founder effect or
depletion of mtDNA variation attributable to drift". The authors noted that
"the first three of these communities were established following the Spanish
expulsion and/or received large influxes of individuals from the Iberian
Peninsula and high variation presently observed, probably reflects high overall
mtDNA diversity among Jews of Spanish descent. Likewise, the mtDNA pool of
Ethiopian Jews reflects the rich maternal lineage variety of East Africa."
Jewish communities from Iraq, Iran, and Yemen showed a "third and intermediate
pattern... consistent with a founding event, but not a narrow one". In this and
other studies Yemenite Jews differ from other Mizrahim, as well as from
Ashkenazim, in the proportion of sub-Saharan African gene types which have
entered their gene pools. African-specific Hg L(xM,N) lineages were found only
in Yemenite and Ethiopian Jewish populations. Among Yemenites, the average
stands at 35% lineages within the past 3,000 years. Genome-wide association and
linkage studies. In genetic epidemiology, a genome-wide association study (GWA
study, or GWAS) is an examination of all or most of the genes (the genome) of
different individuals of a particular species to see how much the genes vary
from individual to individual. These techniques were originally designed for
epidemiological uses, to identify genetic associations with observable traits.
A 2006 study by Seldin, "et al." used over five thousand autosomal SNPs to
demonstrate European genetic substructure amongst the Ashkenazi. The results
showed "a consistent and reproducible distinction between 'northern' and
'southern' European population groups". Most northern, central, and eastern
Europeans (Finns, Swedes, English, Irish, Germans, and Ukrainians) showed >90%
in the 'northern' population group, while most individual participants with
southern European ancestry (Italians, Greeks, Portuguese, Spaniards) showed
>85% in the 'southern' group. Both Ashkenazi Jews as well as Sephardic Jews
showed >85% membership in the "southern" group. Referring to the Jews
clustering with southern Europeans, the authors state the results were
"consistent with a later Mediterranean origin of these ethnic groups". A 2007
study by Bauchet, "et al." found that Ashkenazi Jews were most closely
clustered with Arabic North African populations when compared to Global
population, and in the European structure analysis, they share similarities
only with Greeks and Southern Italians, reflecting their east Mediterranean
origins. A 2010 study on Jewish ancestry by Atzmon-Ostrer "et al." stated "Two
major groups were identified by principal component, phylogenetic, and identity
by descent (IBD) analysis: Middle Eastern Jews and European/Syrian Jews. The
IBD segment sharing and the proximity of European Jews to each other and to
southern European populations suggested similar origins for European Jewry and
refuted large-scale genetic contributions of Central and Eastern European and
Slavic populations to the formation of Ashkenazi Jewry.", as both groupsâ€”the
Middle Eastern Jews and European/Syrian Jews shared common ancestors in the
Middle East about 2500 years ago. The study examines genetic markers spread
across the entire genome and shows that the Jewish groups (Ashkenazi and non
Ashkenazi) share large swaths of DNA, indicating close relationships and that
each of the Jewish groups in the study (Iranian, Iraqi, Syrian, Italian,
Turkish, Greek and Ashkenazi) has its own genetic signature but is more closely
related to the other Jewish groups than to their non Jewish fellow countrymen.
Atzmon's team found that the SNP markers in genetic segments of 3 million DNA
letters or longer were 10 times more likely to be identical among Jews than
non-Jews. Results of the analysis also tally with biblical accounts of the fate
of the Jews. Using their DNA analysis, the authors traced the ancestors of all
Jews to Persia and Babylon, areas that now form part of Iran and Iraq. The
study also found that with respect to non-Jewish European groups, the
population most closely related to Ashkenazi Jews are modern-day Italians. The
study speculated that the genetic-similarity between Ashkenazi Jews and
Italians may be due to inter-marriage and conversions in the time of the Roman
Empire. It was also found that any two Ashkenazi Jewish participants in the
study shared about as much DNA as fourth or fifth cousins These authors also
found that the genetic evidence was compatible with the historically attested
'demographic miracle' when the population of Ashkenazi Jews rose from 50,000 at
the beginning of the 15th century to 5,000,000 at the start of the 19th
century. A 2010 study by Bray "et al", using SNP microarray techniques and
linkage analysis, estimated that 35 to 55 percent of the modern Ashkenazi
genome is specifically traceable to Europe, and that European "admixture is
considerably higher than previous estimates by studies that used the Y
chromosome". The study assumed Druze and Palestinian Arabs populations to
represent the reference to world Jewry ancestor genome. With this reference
point, the linkage disequilibrium in the Ashkenazi Jewish population was
interpreted as "matches signs of interbreeding or 'admixture' between Middle
Eastern and European populations". In their press release, Bray stated: "We
were surprised to find evidence that Ashkenazi Jews have higher heterozygosity
than Europeans, contradicting the widely-held presumption that they have been a
largely isolated group". "Thus, the AJ population shows evidence of past
founding events; however, admixture and selection have also strongly influenced
its current genetic makeup." The authors note that their results will require
further investigation. A 2012 study by Campbell "et al" of North African Jewish
groups (Moroccan, Algerian, Tunisian, Djerban and Libyan) by a variety of
methods including principal components, neighbor joining trees and identity by
descent showed that these populations showed a high degree of endogamy and were
part of a larger Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jewish group. These findings are
consistent with the known history of the North African Jews: the founding of
the population during Classical Antiquity with proselytism of local
populations; this in turn was followed by genetic isolation with the rise of
Christianity and then Islam; and finally admixture following the emigration of
Sephardic Jews during the Inquisition. Demographics. Population centers.
According to the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics there were 13,421,000 Jews
worldwide in 2009, roughly 0.19% of the world's population at the time.
According to the estimates for 2007 of the Jewish People Policy Planning
Institute, the world's Jewish population is 13.2 million. Adherents.com cites
figures ranging from 12 to 18 million. These statistics incorporate both
practicing Jews affiliated with synagogues and the Jewish community, and
approximately 4.5 million unaffiliated and secular Jews. Israel. Israel, the
Jewish nation-state, is the only country in which Jews make up a majority of
the citizens. Israel was established as an independent democratic and Jewish
state on May 14, 1948. Of the 120 members in its parliament, the Knesset,
currently, 12 members of the Knesset are Arab citizens of Israel, most
representing Arab political parties and one of Israel's Supreme Court judges is
a Palestinian Arab. Between 1948 and 1958, the Jewish population rose from
800,000 to two million. Currently, Jews account for 75.4% of the Israeli
population, or 5.9 million people. The early years of the State of Israel were
marked by the mass immigration of Holocaust survivors and Jews fleeing Arab
lands. Israel also has a large population of Ethiopian Jews, many of whom were
airlifted to Israel in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Between 1974 and 1979
nearly 227,258 immigrants arrived in Israel, about half being from the Soviet
Union. This period also saw an increase in immigration to Israel from Western
Europe, Latin America, and North America. A trickle of immigrants from other
communities has also arrived, including Indian Jews and others, as well as some
descendants of Ashkenazi Holocaust survivors who had settled in countries such
as the United States, Argentina, Australia, Chile, and South Africa. Some Jews
have emigrated from Israel elsewhere, due to economic problems or
disillusionment with political conditions and the continuing Arab-Israeli
conflict. Jewish Israeli emigrants are known as yordim. Diaspora (outside
Israel). The waves of immigration to the United States and elsewhere at the
turn of the 19th century, the founding of Zionism and later events, including
pogroms in Russia, the massacre of European Jewry during the Holocaust, and the
founding of the state of Israel, with the subsequent Jewish exodus from Arab
lands, all resulted in substantial shifts in the population centers of world
Jewry by the end of the 20th century. Currently, the largest Jewish community
outside Israel, and either the largest or second-largest Jewish community in
the world is located in the United States, with 5.2 million to 6.4 million Jews
by various estimates. Elsewhere in the Americas, there are also large Jewish
populations in Canada (315,000), Argentina (180,000-300,000), and Brazil
(196,000-600,000), and smaller populations in Mexico, Uruguay, Venezuela,
Chile, and several other countries (see History of the Jews in Latin America).
Western Europe's largest Jewish community, and the third-largest Jewish
community in the world, can be found in France, home to between 483,000 and
500,000 Jews, the majority of whom are immigrants or refugees from North
African Arab countries such as Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia (or their
descendants). The United Kingdom has a Jewish community of 292,000. In Eastern
Europe, there are anywhere from 350,000 to one million Jews living in the
former Soviet Union, but exact figures are difficult to establish. Germany,
with 119,000 Jews, has the fastest-growing Jewish community outside Israel,
especially in Berlin. Tens of thousands of Jews from the former Eastern Bloc
have settled in Germany since the fall of the Berlin Wall, and thousands of
Israelis live in Germany, either permanently or temporarily, for economic
reasons. The Arab countries of North Africa and the Middle East were home to
around 900,000 Jews in 1945. Fueled by anti-Zionism after the founding of
Israel, systematic persecution caused almost all of these Jews to flee to
Israel, North America, and Europe in the 1950s (see Jewish exodus from Arab
lands). Today, around 8,000 Jews remain in all Arab nations combined. Iran is
home to almost 9,000 Jews, and has the second-largest Jewish population in the
Middle East after Israel. From 1948 to 1953, about one-third of Iranian Jews,
most of them poor, emigrated to Israel. Before the 1979 revolution, there were
100,000 Jews living in the country. After the revolution, most of them left
Iran for Israel, Europe, or the United States. Most Iranian-Jewish emigres,
along with many non-Jewish Iranians, went to the US, especially Los Angeles,
where the principal Iranian community is called "Tehrangeles". Outside Europe,
the Americas, the Middle East, and the rest of Asia, there are significant
Jewish populations in Australia (120,000) and South Africa (70,000). There is
also a 7,000-strong community in New Zealand. Demographic changes.
Assimilation. Since at least the time of the Ancient Greeks, a proportion of
Jews have assimilated into the wider non-Jewish society around them, by either
choice or force, ceasing to practice Judaism and losing their Jewish identity.
Assimilation took place in all areas, and during all time periods, with some
Jewish communities, for example the Kaifeng Jews of China, disappearing
entirely. The advent of the Jewish Enlightenment of the 18th century (see
Haskalah) and the subsequent emancipation of the Jewish populations of Europe
and America in the 19th century, accelerated the situation, encouraging Jews to
increasingly participate in, and become part of, secular society. The result
has been a growing trend of assimilation, as Jews marry non-Jewish spouses and
stop participating in the Jewish community. Rates of interreligious marriage
vary widely: In the United States, they are just under 50%, in the United
Kingdom, around 53%, in France, around 30%, and in Australia and Mexico, as low
as 10%. In the United States, only about a third of children from
intermarriages affiliate themselves with Jewish religious practice. The result
is that most countries in the Diaspora have steady or slightly declining
religiously Jewish populations as Jews continue to assimilate into the
countries in which they live. War and persecution. The Jewish people and
Judaism have experienced various persecutions throughout Jewish history. During
late Antiquity and the early Middle Ages the Roman Empire (in its later phases
known as the Byzantine Empire) repeatedly repressed the Jewish population,
first by ejecting them from their homelands during the pagan Roman era and
later by officially establishing them as second-class citizens during the
Christian Roman era. According to James Carroll, "Jews accounted for 10% of the
total population of the Roman Empire. By that ratio, if other factors had not
intervened, there would be 200 million Jews in the world today, instead of
something like 13 million." Later in medieval Western Europe, further
persecutions of Jews in the name of Christianity occurred, notably during the
Crusadesâ€”when Jews all over Germany were massacredâ€”and a series of
expulsions from England, Germany, France, and, in the largest expulsion of all,
Spain and Portugal after the Reconquista (the Catholic Reconquest of the
Iberian Peninsula), where both unbaptized Sephardic Jews and the ruling Muslim
Moors were expelled. In the Papal States, which existed until 1870, Jews were
required to live only in specified neighborhoods called ghettos. In the 19th
and (before the end of World War II) 20th centuries, the Roman Catholic Church
adhered to a distinction between "good antisemitism" and "bad antisemitism".
The "bad" kind promoted hatred of Jews because of their descent. This was
considered un-Christian because the Christian message was intended for all of
humanity regardless of ethnicity; anyone could become a Christian. The "good"
kind criticized alleged Jewish conspiracies to control newspapers, banks, and
other institutions, to care only about accumulation of wealth, etc. Islam and
Judaism have a complex relationship. Traditionally Jews and Christians living
in Muslim lands, known as dhimmis, were allowed to practice their religions and
to administer their internal affairs, but subject to certain conditions. They
had to pay the jizya (a per capita tax imposed on free adult non-Muslim males)
to the Islamic state. Dhimmis had an inferior status under Islamic rule. They
had several social and legal disabilities such as prohibitions against bearing
arms or giving testimony in courts in cases involving Muslims. Many of the
disabilities were highly symbolic. The one described by Bernard Lewis as "most
degrading" was the requirement of distinctive clothing, not found in the Qur'an
or hadith but invented in early medieval Baghdad; its enforcement was highly
erratic. On the other hand, Jews rarely faced martyrdom or exile, or forced
compulsion to change their religion, and they were mostly free in their choice
of residence and profession. Notable exceptions include the massacre of Jews
and/or forcible conversion of some Jews by the rulers of the Almohad dynasty in
Al-Andalus in the 12th century, as well as in Islamic Persia, and the forced
confinement of Moroccan Jews to walled quarters known as mellahs beginning from
the 15th century and especially in the early 19th century. In modern times, it
has become commonplace for standard antisemitic themes to be conflated with
anti-Zionist publications and pronouncements of Islamic movements such as
Hezbollah and Hamas, in the pronouncements of various agencies of the Islamic
Republic of Iran, and even in the newspapers and other publications of Turkish
Refah Partisi." Throughout history, many rulers, empires and nations have
oppressed their Jewish populations or sought to eliminate them entirely.
Methods employed ranged from expulsion to outright genocide; within nations,
often the threat of these extreme methods was sufficient to silence dissent.
The history of antisemitism includes the First Crusade which resulted in the
massacre of Jews; the Spanish Inquisition (led by Torquemada) and the
Portuguese Inquisition, with their persecution and "autos-da-fÃ©" against the
New Christians and Marrano Jews; the Bohdan Chmielnicki Cossack massacres in
Ukraine; the Pogroms backed by the Russian Tsars; as well as expulsions from
Spain, Portugal, England, France, Germany, and other countries in which the
Jews had settled. According to a recent study published in the American Journal
of Human Genetics 19.8% of the modern Iberian population has Sephardic Jewish
ancestry, indicating that the number of conversos may have been much higher
than originally thought. The persecution reached a peak in Nazi Germany's Final
Solution, which led to the Holocaust and the slaughter of approximately 6
million Jews. The HolocaustÂ â€” the state-led systematic persecution and
genocide of European Jews (and certain communities of North African Jews in
European controlled North Africa) and other minority groups of Europe during
World War II by Germany and its collaborators remains the most notable modern
day persecution of Jews. The persecution and genocide were accomplished in
stages. Legislation to remove the Jews from civil society was enacted years
before the outbreak of World War II. Concentration camps were established in
which inmates were used as slave labour until they died of exhaustion or
disease. Where the Third Reich conquered new territory in eastern Europe,
specialized units called Einsatzgruppen murdered Jews and political opponents
in mass shootings. Jews and Roma were crammed into ghettos before being
transported hundreds of miles by freight train to extermination camps where, if
they survived the journey, the majority of them were killed in gas chambers.
Virtually every arm of Germany's bureaucracy was involved in the logistics of
the mass murder, turning the country into what one Holocaust scholar has called
"a genocidal nation." Growth. Israel is the only country with a consistently
growing Jewish population due to natural population increase, though the Jewish
populations of other countries in Europe and North America have recently
increased due to immigration. In the Diaspora, in almost every country the
Jewish population in general is either declining or steady, but Orthodox and
Haredi Jewish communities, whose members often shun birth control for religious
reasons, have experienced rapid population growth. Orthodox and Conservative
Judaism discourage proselytism to non-Jews, but many Jewish groups have tried
to reach out to the assimilated Jewish communities of the Diaspora in order for
them to reconnect to their Jewish roots. Additionally, while in principle
Reform Judaism favors seeking new members for the faith, this position has not
translated into active proselytism, instead taking the form of an effort to
reach out to non-Jewish spouses of intermarried couples. There is also a trend
of Orthodox movements pursuing secular Jews in order to give them a stronger
Jewish identity so there is less chance of intermarriage. As a result of the
efforts by these and other Jewish groups over the past 25 years, there has been
a trend of secular Jews becoming more religiously observant, known as the "Baal
Teshuva" movement, though the demographic implications of the trend are
unknown. Additionally, there is also a growing movement of Jews by Choice by
gentiles who make the decision to head in the direction of becoming Jews.
Leadership. There is no single governing body for the Jewish community, nor a
single authority with responsibility for religious doctrine. Instead, a variety
of secular and religious institutions at the local, national, and international
levels lead various parts of the Jewish community on a variety of issues.
Notable individuals. Jews have made contributions in a broad range of human
endeavors, including the sciences, arts, politics, and business. Although Jews
comprise only 0.2% of the world's population, over 20% of Nobel Prize laureates
have been Jewish, with multiple winners in each field.
