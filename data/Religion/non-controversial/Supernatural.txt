Supernatural The supernatural (Medieval Latin: "supernÄtÅ«rÄlis": "supra"
"above" + "naturalis" "nature", first used: 1520â€“30 AD) is that which is not
subject to the laws of nature, or more figuratively, that which is said to
exist above and beyond nature. With neoplatonic and medieval scholastic
origins, the metaphysical considerations can be difficult to approach as an
exercise in philosophy or theology because any dependencies on its antithesis,
the natural, will ultimately have to be inverted or rejected. In popular
culture and fiction, the supernatural is whimsically associated with the
paranormal and the occult, this differs from traditional concepts in some
religions, such as Catholicism, where divine miracles are considered
supernatural. In Catholicism. In Catholicism, while the meaning of the term and
its antithesis vary, the â€œSupernatural Orderâ€ is the gratuitous production,
by God, of the ensemble of miracles for the elevation of man to a state of
grace, including the hypostatic union (Incarnation), the beatific vision, and
the ministry of angels. Divine operation, â€œspiritual factsâ€ and
â€œvoluntary determinationsâ€ are consistently referred to as
â€œsupernaturalâ€ by those who specifically preclude the â€œextrinsic
concurrenceâ€ of God or by those espousing a materialist or determinist
worldview that excludes immaterial beings or free will. Barring disingenuous
intent, there is no objection to this manner of speaking. Process theology.
Process theology or "process thought" is a school of thought influenced by the
metaphysical process philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead (1861â€“1947) and
further developed by Charles Hartshorne (1897â€“2000). Contrasting views. One
complicating factor is that there is no universal agreement about the
definition of "natural" or the limits of naturalism. Concepts in the
supernatural domain are closely related to concepts in religious spirituality
and occultism or spiritualism. Additionally, by definition anything that exists
naturally is not supernatural. The term "supernatural" is often used
interchangeably with paranormal or preternaturalÂ â€” the latter typically
limited to an adjective for describing abilities which appear to exceed the
bounds of possibility. Epistemologically, the relationship between the
supernatural and the natural is indistinct in terms of natural phenomena that,
"ex hypothesi," violate the laws of nature, in so far as such laws are
realistically accountable. Many supporters of supernatural explanations believe
that past, present, and future complexities and mysteries of the universe
cannot be explained solely by naturalistic means and argue that it is
reasonable to assume that a non-natural entity or entities resolve the
unexplained. Proponents of supernaturalism regard their belief system as more
flexible, allowing more diversity in terms of intuition and epistemology.
