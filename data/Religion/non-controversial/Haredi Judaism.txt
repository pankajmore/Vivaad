Haredi Judaism Haredi ( ', ), or Charedi/Chareidi Judaism ("pl. Haredim"), is
the most conservative form of Orthodox Judaism, often referred to by outsiders
as ultra-Orthodox. Haredi Jews consider their belief system and religious
practices to extend in an unbroken chain back to Moses and the giving of the
Torah on Mount Sinai, and they regard non-Orthodox, and to an extent Modern
Orthodox, streams of Judaism to be deviations from authentic Judaism. Its
historical rejection of Enlightenment values distinguishes it from Western
European-derived Modern Orthodox Judaism. Haredi Judaism is not an
institutionally cohesive or homogeneous group, but comprises a diversity of
spiritual and cultural orientations, generally divided into a broad range of
Hasidic sects, Lithuanian-Yeshivish streams from Eastern Europe, and Oriental
Sephardic Haredim. These groups often differ significantly from one another in
their specific ideologies and lifestyles, as well as the degree of stringency
in religious practice, rigidity of religious philosophy and isolation from the
general culture that they maintain. Haredim are currently primarily located in
Israel, North America and Western Europe. The population is growing very
rapidly, due to high birth rate, and doubles every 12 to 20 years. Estimates of
the number of Haredim globally are difficult to measure, due to its imprecise
definition, lack of data collection and rapid change over time. One newspaper
article estimated there were approximately 1.3 million Haredi Jews as of 2011.
The Haredi community has gained growing media interest, in particular on the
issue of sex segregation in Israel and New York. Terminology. According to
Nachman Ben-Yehuda, "the Hebrew word Haredi derives from harada â€“ fear and
anxiety â€“meaning, 'he who is anxious about, and/or fearful of, the word of
the Almighty.'" Nurit Stadler writes that the word "meaning 'those who fear or
tremble', appears in Isaiah 66:5: 'Hear the word of the Lord, you who tremble
at His word'". Other sources give Isaiah 66:5 and Ezra 10:3 ("those that
tremble at the commandment of our God") as the sources. In general, the word
"connotes awe-inspired, fearful of God's majesty", similar to the way Quakers
use the term. The term "ultra-Orthodox" is often used instead of the term
Haredi. Some regard this term to be misleading: Ami Ayalon writes that "Haredi"
is preferable because Ayalon, Ami (1999). "Language as a barrier to political
reform in the Middle East", "International Journal of the Sociology of
Language", Volume 137, pp. 67â€“80. Use of the term "ultra-Orthodox" can also
be controversial, and is considered pejorative by Ayalon, Norman Lamm and
others. Canada's Centre for Faith and Media, while stating that the term
"sometimes... cannot be avoided", advises journalists to "A Journalist's Guide
to Judaism", Centre for Faith and Media website, Resources, Religion Guides,
pp. 2â€“3. Retrieved August 25, 2009. The "Jewish Telegraphic Agency" stopped
using the term in the 1990s, substituting "fervently Orthodox" or "Haredi" or
both. Then-editor Lisa Hostein stated "'ultra-Orthodox' was seen as a
derogatory term that suggested extremism". A New Jersey based newspaper, "The
Star-Ledger", reportedly dropped the term ultra-orthodox in 2009. More
generally, a range of other expressions are used among Haredi Jews to describe
themselves and others in the community, such as "Yidn" (Jews), "erlekhe Yidn"
(virtuous Jews), "frum" (pious), "heimish" (home-like, i.e. "our crowd"),
"yeshivish" and "Anash (anshei-shloimeinu â€“ members of our community)". These
have varying meanings depending on the context. In Israel, Haredi Jews are
sometimes referred to as "blacks" (Hebrew "shechorim") by the seculars, a
derogatory reference to the black clothes they typically wear. They are also
referred to by the slang word "dos" (plural "dosim" or "dossim"), another
derogatory term that mimics the traditional Ashkenazi Hebrew pronunciation of
the word "datim", meaning religious. History. For several centuries before the
emancipation of European Jewry, most of Europe's Jews were forced to live in
closed communities, where both the culture and their religious observances were
preserved. This occurred both because of internal pressure within the
communities and because of the outside world's refusal to accept them
otherwise. In the overwhelmingly Christian society of the time, the only way
for Jews to gain social acceptance was to convert, thereby abandoning all ties
with their own families and community. Few avenues existed, especially in the
ghetto, for individuals to negotiate between the dominant culture and the
community, because this was handled by the larger community as a whole. This
situation began to change with the Age of Enlightenment and calls by some
European liberals to include the Jewish population in the emerging empires and
nation states, as well as with Jewry's own Haskalah. These adherents held that
acceptance by the non-Jewish world necessitated the reformation of Jews
themselves, and the modification of those practices deemed inconsistent with
this goal. In the words of a popular aphorism coined by Yehuda Leib Gordon, a
person should be "a Jew in the home, and a "mentsh" in the street." For some
Jews, the meticulous and rigorous Judaism practiced in the ghetto interfered
with these new outside opportunities. This group argued that Judaism itself had
to "reform" in keeping with the social changes taking place around them. They
were the forerunners of the Reform movement in Judaism. This group
overwhelmingly assimilated into the surrounding culture. Other Jews argued that
the division between Jew and gentile had actually protected the Jews' religious
and social culture; abandoning such divisions, they argued, would lead to the
eventual abandonment of Jewish religion through assimilation. This latter group
insisted that the appropriate response to the Enlightenment was to maintain
strict adherence to traditional Jewish law and custom to prevent the
dissolution of authentic Judaism and ensure the survival of the Jewish people.
Even as the debate raged, the rate of integration and assimilation grew
proportionately to the degree of acceptance of the Jewish population by the
host societies. In other countries, particularly in Eastern Europe, acceptance
(and integration) was much slower in coming. This was especially true in the
Pale of Settlement, a region along the Russian Empire's western border
including most of modern Belarus and Ukraine, to which Jewish settlement in the
empire was confined. Although Jews here did not win the same official
acceptance as they did in Western and Central Europe, the same enlightened
spirit of change pervaded the air, albeit in a local variant. Since it was
impossible to gain acceptance by the dominant culture, many Jews either
emigrated or turned to a number of different movements that they expected would
offer hope for a better future. Some Jews, particularly secularized young
people, embraced various versions of social radicalism, particularly Social
Democracy in its Bundist, Polish nationalist-socialist (PPS), and Menshevik
forms; some later became Communists as well, particularly in the Soviet Union.
A much larger number of East European Jews chose a less radical 'politics of
exit': they embraced or grew more sympathetic to some version of Jewish
nationalism, particularly Zionism (which they often combined with some form of
liberal politics vis-a-vis citizenship rights in Eastern European states).
Beginning as a popular but insurgent movement in Russia in the 1880s, Zionism
attained something like communal dominance by the close of the First World War
(except in the Soviet Union, where the Communist regime suppressed it beginning
in 1918). In the context of the general shift toward ethnonationalist politics
across Eastern Europe during World War I and the devastating effects of the war
on traditional Jewish society and its certainties, Jewish nationalist parties
(particularly Zionists of various stripes) consistently won a plurality or even
a majority of Jewish votes in the various local-communal and national elections
the took place in Russia and Ukraine in the brief interim period after the fall
of the Tsarist regime and in newly emergent nation-states with large East
European Jewish minorities like Poland and Lithuania. Concomitantly, by the
period between the world wars, the leading (ie most popular and widely sold)
Yiddish daily newspapers in Poland and Lithania were broadly identified with
Zionism. Both the socialist and the Jewish nationalist movements were not
neutral on the topic of the Jewish religion: by and large, they entailed a
complete, not infrequently contemptuous, rejection of traditional religious and
cultural norms. Those who opposed these changes reacted in a variety of ways.
In Germany, the usual approach was to accept the tools of modern scholarship
and apply them in defence of Orthodoxy, so as to defeat the Reformers at their
own game. One proponent of this approach was Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch, who
coined the slogan Torah Im Derech Eretz (Torah with civilization) and led a
secession from German Jewish communal organizations to form a strictly Orthodox
movement with its own network of synagogues and schools, known as "Adath
Israel". His movement still has followers, and their standard of observance is
very strict, but because of their acceptance of secular learning they are not
normally classified as Haredim. Some Galician scholars, such as Zvi Hirsch
Chayes, followed a somewhat similar approach. In Eastern Europe there was
little in the way of organised Reform Judaism, but the advocates of modernity
came under the umbrella either of the Haskalah or of political movements such
as Bundism or Zionism. The traditionalist opposition was generally associated
either with the various Hasidic groups or with the growing network of yeshivas
among the Lithuanian Jews, some of which (e.g. the Volozhin yeshiva) even
closed rather than comply with the Russian Government's demand for secular
studies to be incorporated into the curriculum. In Germany the opponents of
Reform rallied to Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch and his "Adath Israel". In Poland
Jews true to traditional values gathered under the banner of "Agudas Shlumei
Emunei Yisroel". The decisive event came in 1912 with the foundation of the
Agudas Israel movement, which became a potent political force and even obtained
seats in the Polish sejm (parliament). This movement contained representatives
of several of the streams of traditionalism already mentioned. The
traditionalists of Eastern Europe, who fought against the new movements
emerging in the Jewish community, were the forebears of the contemporary
Haredim. Formation. The formation of the Haredi stream of Orthodox Judaism is
widely attributed to Rabbi Moses Sofer ("the Chasam Sofer"), Rabbi Elija Kramer
(Vilna Gaon), Rabbi Israel Baal Shem Tov and their disciples. Sofer, Chief
Rabbi of the Orthodox community in Pressburg (Bratislava) was a pupil of Rabbi
Nathan Adler of Frankfurt who was a Master of Kabbalah as well as a pupil of
Rabbi Pinchas HaLevi Horowitz of Frankfurt, a renowned Talmudist. Thus Sofer
was respected by the Hasidim and Misnagdim alike. Sofer applied a pun to the
Talmudic term chodosh asur min ha-Torah, ""'new' is forbidden by the Torah""
(referring literally to eating "chodosh", "new grain", before the Omer offering
is given) as a slogan heralding his opposition to any philosophical, social or
practical change to customary Orthodox practice. Thus, he did not allow any
secular studies to be added to the curriculum of his Pressburg Yeshiva. Sofer's
most notable student Rabbi Moshe Shic together with Sofer's sons Rabbis Shimon
and Samuel Benjamin took an active role in arguing the Reform movement but
showed relative tolerance for heterogeneity within the Orthodox camp. Others,
such as the more zealous Rabbi Hillel Lichtenstein based a more stringent
position to orthodoxy. Starting in 1830, about twenty disciples of Sofer
settled in the Holy Land, almost all of them in Jerusalem. They joined the Old
Yishuv, which comprised the Musta'arabim, Sephardim and Ashkenazim. They
settled in Jerusalem, Safed, Tiberias and Hebron. Together with the Perushim
and Hassidim they formed a similar approach to Judaism reflecting those of
their European counterparts A major historic event that facilitated the
redefinition of Judaism was the meltdown after the Universal Israelite Congress
of 1868â€“69 in Pest. In an attempt to unify all streams of Judaism under one
constitution, the Orthodox offered the Shulchan Aruch as the ruling Code of law
and observance. This notation was dismissed by the reformists, leading many
Orthodox Rabbis to resign from the Congress and form their own Social and
Political groups. Hungarian Jewry split into two major institutionally
sectarian groups, Orthodox and Neolog. However, some communities refused to
join either of the groups calling themselves Status Quo. In 1871 Shimon Sofer,
Chief Rabbi of Krakow, founded the Machzikei Hadas organisation with the
Hasidic Rabbi Yehoshua Rokeach of Belz. This was the first effort of Haredi
Jews in Europe to create a political party and may be seen as a part of the
developing rebranding of the traditional Orthodoxy into a self defined group.
Rabbi Shimon was nominated as a candidate to the Polish Regional Parliament
under the Austraian emperor Franz Joseph. He found favor over his modern
counterparts and was elected to the "The Polish Club" in which he took active
part until his death. Shik demonstrated support in 1877 for the separatist
policies of Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch in Germany. Schick's own son was
enrolled in the Hildesheimer Rabbinical Seminary that taught secular studies
and was headed by Azriel Hildesheimer. Hirsch, however, did not reciprocate and
expressed astonishment at Schick's halakhic contortions in condemning even
those Status Quo communities that clearly adhered to halakhah. Lichtenstein
opposed Hildesheimer and his son Hirsh as they made use of the German language
in sermons from the pulpit and seemed to sway to the direction of Modern
Zionism. [http://www.jewishgen.org/yizkor/kolomyya/kol041.html Shimon Sofer was
somewhat more lenient than Lichtenstein on the use of German in sermons
allowing so only if it was a medium for keeping cordial relations with the
various governments. Likewise, he allowed extra-curricular studies of the
gymnasium for students whose rabbinical positions would be recognized by the
governments, stipulating the necessity to prove the strict adherence to the
God-fearing (Haredi) standards per individual case. [http://

World Agudath Israel was founded to differentiate itself from the Torah
Nationalists Mizrachi and Secular Zionist organisations. It was dominated by
the Hasidic Rebbes and Lithuainian rosh yeshivas. Agudah nominated Rabbis who
were elected as representatives in the Polish government Sejm, such as Rabbi
Meir Shapiro and Rabbi Yitzhak-Meir Levin. Notably, not all Hasidic factions
joined the Agudath Israel, remaining independent such as Machzikei Hadat of
Galicia. [http://archive.jta.org/article/1934/09/13/2819491/new-religious-
party] In 1924 Agudath Israel obtained 75 percent of the votes in the Kehillah
elections. [http://archive.jta.org/article/1928/08/21/2772917/berlin-
conference-adopts-constitution-for-world-union-progressive-judaism] In 1919,
Rabbi Yosef Chaim Sonnenfeld (student of Ksav Sofer) and Rabbi Yitzchok
Yerucham Diskin (son of Rabbi Yehoshua Leib Diskin, from Brisk, Lithuania)
founded the Edah HaChareidis as part of Agudath Israel in then Mandate
Palestine. The Edah HaChareidis was actively anti-Zionist and opposed to the
armed struggle of the Hagana. They attempted to gain political recognition and
peacefully attain autonomic authority over parts of the Holy Land. Their
ambassador Dr Jacob IsraÃ«l de Haan met with Hashemite leader Hussein bin Ali
on this issue. Hussein granted him a handwritten letter outlining a draft
understanding between the Orthodox Jews and their Arab neighbors, which would
require them to denounce the Balfour Declaration in return for autonomy over
parts of Transjordan. This letter was presented to the first Agudath Israel
Convention in Vienna in 1923 by Rabbi Moshe Blau. The Orthodox community polled
some 16,000 of a total 90,000 at the Knesseth Israel in 1929. [http://
archive.jta.org/article/1929/02/28/2775631/agudah-claims-16205-palestine-jews-
favor-separate-communities] But Sonnenfeld lobbied Sir John Chancellor, the
High Commissioner for separate representation in the Palestine Communities
Ordinance than that of the Knesseth Israel explaining that the Agudas Israel
community would cooperate with the Vaad Leumi and the National Jewish Council
in matters pertaining to the municipality, but seeks to protect is its
religious convictions independently. The community petitioned the Permanent
Mandates Commission of the League of Nations on this issue. The one community
principle was victorious despite their opposition., but this is seen as the
creation of the Haredi community in Israel separate from the other modern
Orthodox and Zionist movements. [http://archive.jta.org/article/1927/07/20/
2767560/palestine-communities-ordinance-promulgated] In 1932 Sonnefeld was
succeeded by Rabbi Yosef Tzvi Dushinsky (I) a disciple of the Shevet Sofer, one
of the grandchildren of Moses Sofer. Dushinsky promised to build up a strong
Jewish Orthodoxy at peace with the other Jewish communities and the non-Jews.
In 1945, the Edah HaChareidis parted ways with Agudat Yisrael. In 1948 Rabbi
Zelig Reuven Bengis (1864â€“1953) succeeded Dushinski and with his passing the
Chief Rabbinate was passed onto Grand Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum of Satmar
(1887â€“1979). Satmar chassidism was founded by Rabbi Moshe Teitelbaum (Ujhel)
a hasid who paid homage to Moses Sofer. Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum was a passionate
opponent of Modern Zionism and had great influence on the Edah HaCharedit but
soon emigrated to the United States, still holding his title of Chief Rabbi of
the Edah HaChareidis. In the U.S. he attracted many new followers and
influenced many leaders of the Orthodox Hassidic Rabbis and established a large
community in the densely Orthodox neighborhood of Williamsburg, located in
northern Brooklyn in New York City. Today's Satmar community in New York
numbers close to 130,000 adherents (including men, women and children). Present
day. Practices and beliefs. Views of Jewish law. One basic belief of the
Orthodox community in general is that it is the latest link in a chain of
Jewish continuity extending back to the giving of the Torah to Moses at Mount
Sinai. They maintain the position of the Mishnah and Talmud as explained by
Maimonides that two distinct guides to Jewish law were given to the Israelites
at that time: the first, known as the "Torah she-bi-khtav", or the "Written
Law", which is the Torah as Jews know it today. The second, known as the "Torah
she-ba'al peh" ("Oral Law"), is the explanation of the Written Law that was
given to Moses as the proper interpretation of the Written law. Jewish law,
known as "halacha", are the final conclusions based on the Talmud as to how one
should conduct oneself in matters pertaining to the spiritual, moral, religious
and personal. As such, it includes codes of law applicable to many hypothetical
circumstances, which have been pored over and developed throughout the
generations in a constantly expanding collection of religious literature.
"Halacha" is a guide for everything the traditional Jew does from the moment of
awakening until the moment of sleep. It is a body of intricate laws, combined
with logical explanations of the reasoning behind each law. Halacha
incorporates many traditional practices into those rules, some of which started
as customs passed down over the millennia, as well as an assortment of deeply
ingrained cultural behaviors. It is the subject of intense study in religious
schools known as "yeshivas" (essentially, Jewish law schools that also study
Jewish literature and customs in general). Throughout history, "halacha" has
addressed issues on the basis of circumstance and precedent. There have been
some significant adaptations over the centuries, including more formal
education for women in the early twentieth century, and the application of
halacha to modern technology. While Haredim have typically been more
conservative than their Modern Orthodox counterparts regarding new practices
and rulings on new applications of halachic concepts, Orthodox Judaism views
these types of innovations as consistent with traditionally expounded
"halachic" concepts. Haredi Orthodoxy's differences with Modern Orthodoxy
usually lie in interpretation of the nature of traditional halachic concepts
and in understanding of what constitutes acceptable application of these
concepts to the modern world. Modern inventions have been studied and
incorporated into the ever-expanding halacha, accepted by both Haredi and other
Orthodox communities. For instance, rulings were made about the proper use of
electricity and other technology by Orthodox Jews during Jewish Sabbath (and
holidays) to make sure that the Written Laws (Torah she-bi-khtav) were not
being violated. There is consensus in the Orthodox community regarding most
major points, although fine points are the subject of deep debates with a wide
range of opinions. While discussions of halacha are common and encouraged, the
final determinations as to the applicability of the law in all situations rests
in the hands of the local Orthodox rabbi or "posek" (rabbinical authority).
Lifestyle and family. Haredi life is very family-centered. Depending on various
factors, boys and girls attend separate schools and proceed to higher Torah
study, in a "yeshiva" or "seminary" respectively, starting anywhere between the
ages of 13 and 18. A significant proportion of young men remain in "yeshiva"
until their shidduch, introduction to a woman for the purpose of seeing if the
couple wishes to marry. Many also continue study in "kollel" (a Torah study
institute for married men) for many years after marriage. In many Haredi
communities, studying in secular institutions is discouraged, although some
have educational facilities for vocational training or run professional
programs for men and women. Most men, even those not in kollel, will make
certain to study Jewish texts (collectively referred to as Torah) daily.
Families tend to be large, reflecting adherence to the Torah commandment "be
fruitful and multiply" (Book of Genesis 1:28, 9:1,7). Haredi rabbis generally
recommend very strongly against watching television and films, reading secular
newspapers, and using the Internet without filters that block pornography and
the like. Because of this, some Haredim also use mobile phones that are
programmed to disable internet and other functions that could influence their
users in undesired ways, and most companies in Israel now offer basic cell
phones with limited capabilities to accommodate Haredim. However, it appears
that many Haredi people use the Internet, as evidenced by the large number of
participants in "Haredi chat rooms". In May of 2012, 40,000 Haredim gathered at
Citi Field Stadium in New York to discuss the dangers of the Internet. Some
Haredi publications have a policy of not publishing photographs of women; the
newspaper "Yated Ne'eman" in April 2009 digitally altered photographs of the
newly installed Israeli cabinet to replace two female ministers with pictures
of men, while another newspaper blacked the women out of their published
photograph. Dress. Many Haredim view manner of dress as an important way to
ensure Jewish identity and distinctiveness. In addition, a simple, understated
mode of dress is seen as conducive to inner reflection and spiritual growth. As
such, many Haredim are wary of modern clothing (some of which may compromise
their standards of modesty). Many men have beards, most dress in dark suits,
and wear a wide-brimmed hat (typically black) during prayer and while outside,
and men wear a (typically black) kippah at all times. Women adhere to
meticulous "tznius" (modesty) standards, and hence wear long skirts and long
sleeves, high necklines and some form of head covering if married: scarves,
snoods, "shpitzelach", hats, or sheitels (wigs). Hasidic men often follow the
specific dress style of their group, which may include long jackets or coats
(often called either a frock coat, kapote, or sirtuk), or a full-length suit
jacket called a "rekel". Common formal wear include long silken jackets
("bekishes"), wide or high fur hats ("shtreimels" or "spodiks"). These clothes
are worn on the Sabbath and festivals as well as to weddings and events of
communal importance. During prayer many men wear a "gartel" (a long belt
wrapped around the waist of the outer layer of clothing). Although common to
the dress of Hasidic and non-Hasidic Jews in pre-World War II Europe, present-
day use of the gartel is primarily relegated to those with Hasidic customs.
However, some non-Hasidic Haredim continue to maintain this garb. Populations
and relations with larger society. Demographics. Estimates for Haredi
population are difficult to obtain and may significantly underestimate the true
number of Haredim, due to their reluctance to participate in surveys and
censuses. However, studies do show a very high growth rate with a large young
population. Other countries with significant Haredi populations include Canada,
France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Austria, South Africa and
Australia. Israel. Demographics. Israel is home to the largest Haredi
population, at approx. 700,000 (out of 6 million Israeli Jews). The number of
Haredi Jews in Israel is rising rapidly. In 1992, out of a total of 1,500,000
Orthodox Jews world wide, about 550,000 were Haredi (half of them in Israel).
The vast majority of Haredi Jews are Ashkenazi. However, some 20% of the Haredi
population are thought to belong to the Sephardic Haredi stream. Jerusalem (Mea
Shearim, Beis Yisroel, Geula, Har Nof, Ramat Shlomo, Ramot, Neve Yaakov, Maalot
Dafna, Ramat Eshkol, Ezras Torah, Sanhedria Murhevet, Mattisdorf, Bayit VeGan),
Bnei Brak, Modi'in Illit, Beitar Illit, Beit Shemesh, Kiryat Ye'arim, Ashdod,
Tzfat and El'ad. Intercommunal tension. The Haredi community in Israel has
adopted a policy of cultural dissociation, but at the same time, it has
struggled to remain politically active, perceiving itself as the true protector
of the country's Jewish nature. The issues date to the late nineteenth-early
twentieth century, with the rise of Zionism. The vast majority of Haredi Jews
rejected Zionism for a number of reasons. Chief among these was the claim that
Jewish political independence could only be obtained through Divine
intervention, with the coming of the Messiah. Any attempt to force history was
seen as an open rebellion against Judaism (for a more complete exposition of
this ideology see Three Oaths; Vayoel Moshe; Neturei Karta). More important was
the dislike that the political and cultural Zionism of the time felt toward any
manifestation of religion. Influenced by socialism, secular Zionists looked on
religion as an outdated relic, which should disappear (or, according to some
extreme views, even be eradicated) in favor of Jewish nationalism. As with the
nineteenth century Reform Judaism movement in Germany, the result was mutual
recriminations, rejection, and harsh verbal attacks. To Zionists, Haredi Jews
were either "primitives" or "parasites"; to Haredi Jews, Zionists were
tyrannizing heretics. This "kulturkampf" still plagues Israeli society today,
where animosity between the two groups has even pervaded both their educational
systems. Despite the animosity, it was necessary for the two groups to work out
some "modus vivendi" in the face of a more dangerous enemy, the Nazis. This was
achieved by a division of powers and authority, based on the division that
existed during the British Mandate in the country. Known as the "status quo",
it granted political authority (such as control over public institutions, the
army, etc.) to the Zionists and religious authority (such as control over
marriage, divorce, conversions, etc.) to the Orthodox. A compromise worked out
by Labor Zionist leader Berl Katznelson even before statehood ensured that
public institutions accommodate the Orthodox by observing the Sabbath and
providing kosher food. Notwithstanding these compromises, many Haredi groups
maintained their previous apolitical stance. The community had split into two
parts: Agudat Israel, which cooperated with the state, and the Edah
HaChareidis, which fiercely opposed it. Both groups still exist today, with the
same attitudes. The Edah HaChareidis includes numerous Hasidic groups, such as
Satmar, Dushinsky and Toldos Aharon, as well as several non-Hasidic groups of
Lithuanian and Hungarian background. A small minority of Jews, who claim to
have been descended from communities who had lived peacefully with their Arab
neighbors during the 18th and early 19th centuries, took a different stance. In
1935 they formed a new grouping called the Neturei Karta out of a coalition of
several previous anti-Zionist Jewish groups in the Holy Land, and aligned
themselves politically with the Arabs out of a dislike for Zionist policies.
Education. Haredim have a separate system of education in Israel, called
Chinuch Atzmai. There are four distinct education systems in Israel, the other
three being the state system ("Mamlachti"), the state-religious system
("Mamlachti dati") and the Arab system. There is a strong emphasis on Jewish
studies in Haredi school programs. The schools are partially supported by the
State; however, the Ministry of Education is not responsible for the hiring and
firing of teachers or for the registration of pupils. Chinuch Atzmai's funding
has traditionally been supplemented by donations from outside of Israel,
particularly from the United States. The Haredim's lack of mainstream
education, and consequent low participation in the workforce, are regarded by
many in Israel as a social problem. The Council for Higher Education announced
in 2012 that it was investing NIS 180 million over the following five years to
establish appropriate frameworks for the education of Haredim, focusing on
specific professions. Military. As part of the Status quo Agreement worked out
between prime minister David Ben-Gurion and religious parties, Haredi leader
Rabbi Avraham Yeshayah Karelitz (known as the "Chazon Ish") was promised that
the government would exempt a group of religious scholars (at that time, 400)
from compulsory military service so that they could pursue their studies. That
exemption is called "Torato Omanuto"; it allows Haredi young men whose main
occupation is Torah study to delay conscription to the Israel Defense Forces or
to avoid it completely. The number of beneficiaries of the "Torato Omanuto"
arrangement has greatly increased, and this is resented by some Israelis who
are subject to conscription. The "Torato Omanuto" arrangement was enshrined in
the "Tal Law" that came in force in 2002. The High Court later ruled that it
could not be extended in its current form beyond August 2012. A replacement was
expected. The IDF was however experiencing a shortage of personnel, and there
were pressure to reduce the scope of the "Torato Omanuto" exemption. The Shahar
program, also known as "Shiluv Haredim" ("Ultra-Orthodox integration") allows
Haredi men aged 22 to 26 to serve in the army for about a year and a half. At
the beginning of their service, they study mathematics and English, which are
not well covered in Haredi schools. The program is partly aimed at encouraging
Haredi participation in the workforce after military service. Not all
beneficiaries however seem to be Haredim. As many as 1000 Haredi Jews have
chosen to volunteer to serve in the IDF, in a Haredi Jewish unit, the Netzah
Yehuda Battalion, also known as Nahal Haredi. The vast majority of Haredi men,
however, continue to receive deferments from military service. Involvement in
the political process. The Agudat Yisrael party, supported by much of the
Haredi population, was invited to participate in the governing coalition
shortly after the Israeli Declaration of Independence. It agreed, but did not
appoint any ministers since that would have implied participation in non-
religious actions taken by the government. Haredim proved to be able
politicians, gradually increasing their leverage and influence. In addition,
the Haredi population grew substantially, giving them a larger power base. From
a small group of just four members in the 1977 Knesset, they gradually
increased the number of seats they hold to 22 (out of 120) in 1999. In effect,
they controlled the balance of power between the country's two major parties.
In the early 1980s the Shas party of Sephardic Haredim was set up. Shas
appealed to Sephardim who felt marginalized by the dominant Ashkenazi Zionist
establishment. In 1999, Shas gained 17 Knesset seats (other Haredim won 5
seats). Taking the attitude that restoring Sephardic pride and restoring
Sephardic religious observance are one and the same, Shas has created devoted
cadres of newly religious and semi-religious men and women with the zeal of
neophytes and an animosity toward the country's secular European political
establishment. Furthermore, the movement has shown unwavering and determined
obedience in its supporters to the teachings of its spiritual leader, Rabbi
Ovadiah Yosef. Following the 2003 elections, the Haredi parties lost their
place in the government to the secular anti-religious Shinui party (since
defunct). Shinui opposed the funding of Haredi schools and the Torato Omanuto
exemption from military service. In 2005 Shinui left the government and Ariel
Sharon brought the Haredi United Torah Judaism party into his ruling coalition.
In 2010, the Sephardic Haredi political party Shas broke ranks with Ashkenazi
Haredi organizations and joined the World Zionist Organization, becoming the
first officially Zionist Haredi political party. Employment. As of 2012 it was
estimated that 37% of Haredi men and 49% of Haredi women were employed. The
Trajtenberg Committee, charged in 2011 with drafting proposals for economic and
social change, called, among other things, for increasing employment among the
Haredi population. Its proposals included encouraging military or national
service and offering college prep courses for volunteers, creating more
employment centers targeting Haredim and experimental matriculation prep
courses after Yeshiva hours. The committee also called for increasing the
number of Haredi students receiving technical training through the Industry,
Trade and Labor Ministry and forcing Haredi schools to carry out standardized
testing, as is done at other public schools. Other issues. A chief antagonist
of the Haredim (from the Haredi point of view) is the Supreme Court of Israel,
which does not base its rulings on halachic beliefs or policy. A notable case
of this trend is the "Who is a Jew?" case in which the Supreme Court ruled that
the Ministry of the Interior (then controlled by Shas) must recognize Reform
and Conservative converts to Judaism. In many instances, the Haredim have
responded to these perceived threats angrily, verbally defending against their
opponents. At the same time, they recognize the animosity many secular Israelis
feel toward them and have embarked on various public relations campaigns and
other media projects to improve their image among the general public. In
practice, the Israeli Haredim remain firmly entrenched in seats of political
power befitting their voting strength, with both blocs doing everything they
can to gain their support. The Haredim are relatively poor, compared to other
Israelis, but represent an important market sector. Consequently, the Israeli
Haredim "probably spend more time in formal study than any other class of
humans ever has in the history of the planet". More than 50 percent live below
the poverty line and get state allowances, compared with 15 percent of the rest
of the population..." Their families are also larger, usually having six or
seven children. In recent years, there has been a process of reconciliation and
a merging of Haredi Jews with Israeli society, for example in relation to
employment. While not compromising on religious issues and their strict code of
life, Haredi Jews have become more open to the secular Israeli culture. Haredi
Jews, such as satirist Kobi Arieli, publicist Sehara Blau and politician Israel
Eichler write regularly to leading Israeli newspapers. Another important factor
in the reconciliation process has been the activity of ZAKA â€“ a voluntary
rescue organization run by Haredim, which provides emergency first response
medical attention at suicide bombing scenes and retrieves human remains found
there to provide proper burial. Another important Haredi institution of charity
is Yad Sara, established by Uri Lupolianski (mayor of Jerusalem 2003â€“2009) in
1977. Yad Sara, the only Israeli institution of its kind, provides patients and
the handicapped with medical equipment (such as wheelchairs) on loan at no
charge, and it is open to all Israelis. Religious Zionists, mainly from the
National Religious Party and publicly involved Haredi Jews are trying to bridge
the gaps between secular Jews and Haredi Jews. Between Haredi Judaism and
National Religious or Religious Zionist Judaism, there is also a category of
Orthodox Jews known as 'Hardalim', who combine Religious Zionism with a
stricter adherence to Halacha. Mehadrin bus lines, which used to serve Haredi
population centres, were found to be unlawful by a January 2011 ruling of the
Israeli High Court of Justice. Mehadrin buses are segregated by sex, with males
sitting in the front and females sitting in the back of the bus. However, the
court rule allowed the continuation of the gender segregation in public buses
on a strictly voluntary basis for a one-year experimental period. In December
2011, several separate incidents took place in rapid succession, creating a
large public discussion about the position of Haredim in Israeli society, and
leading to widespread incitement in both directions - seculars about Haredim,
and Haredim about seculars. These incidents included cases of women refusing to
move to the back of 'Mehadrin' (segregated) buses, and escalating disagreements
in Beit Shemesh surrounding a non-Haredi girls' school, which developed into
violence. In the course of the public and political debate that followed, the
separate incidents merged into a single major debate with Haredim on one side
and the secular world on the other side, which is continuing in full. United
States. Demographics. The United States is home to the second largest Haredi
population. In 2000, there were 360,000 Haredi Jews in the U.S. (7.2% of the
total Jewish population). The University of Manchester cited an estimate of
468,000 as of 2006. In 1988, it was estimated that there are between 40,000 and
57,000 Haredim in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York, mostly
Hasidim. The Jewish population in the Borough Park neighborhood of Brooklyn
(70,000 in 1983) was also mostly Haredi (also mostly Hasidim). The numbers
provided are inconclusive, given the tremendous birthrate of Haredi Jews in
Wiliamsburg and Borough Park; some estimate their population has doubled or
tripled in the last 20 years. Other Hasidic enclaves include Kiryas Joel and
New Square. Large Haredi enclaves exist in New York (Flatbush, Williamsburg and
Crown Heights sections of Brooklyn, Monsey), New Jersey (Lakewood, Passaic),
Los Angeles, California, Chicago, Illinois, Cleveland, Ohio, and Baltimore,
Maryland. History: A Jewish subculture and debate with more liberal movements.
While there has been a Haredi presence in the U.S. since the start of the 20th
century, the various groups began to emerge as distinctive communities only in
the 1950s, with the influx of refugees from the Holocaust in Eastern Europe,
who quickly filled leadership positions. Before then, the distinctions that are
now commonly made between Haredi and Modern Orthodox Jews were moot at best;
dividing lines between the two camps can now be drawn, though it is important
to recognize that there is a substantial overlap between the two communities.
As the tides of Jewish immigrants to the United States in the late nineteenth-
early twentieth centuries became more settled and affluent, they looked to
Europe to provide rabbis and other spiritual leaders and teachers for their
emerging communities. While some rabbis accepted the challenge, a number of
them returned to Europe soon after, frustrated by what they found in the United
States. Unlike Eastern Europe, where Jews constituted a distinct minority
group, the United States offered Jews an opportunity to blend into the dominant
culture. Many of the new immigrants dropped their traditional customs and laws,
both out of choice (the U.S. offered them a chance to escape what they viewed
as the constraints of religious identity) or not (Jews refusing to work on the
Sabbath were almost always fired at the end of the week;; the large majority of
those who desisted from working on Saturday had to face the formidable
challenge of finding new work each week). The groups that arrived en masse
after the Holocaust found a religious and social infrastructure already in
place. While they feared that their communities might assimilate into the
mainstream of American society, they were also able to create more insular
communities, devoid of all but the most necessary contacts with the surrounding
society. As the communities became more affluent, they were able to assume more
and more roles of the city and state for themselves. Today, there exist many
autonomous communities in places such as Borough Park, Williamsburg, and Crown
Heights in Brooklyn, as well as more recently the yeshiva centered community of
Lakewood, New Jersey, with their own economies, educational systems
("yeshivos") welfare institutions and "gemachs" (free-loan funds for everything
from money to household items to tools, clothing, books and services), medical
services (such as the "Hatzalah" ambulance corps), and security (the "Shomrim"
neighborhood patrol). Some smaller, more isolationist Hasidic groups actually
founded their own small towns, such as New Square, New York, and Kiryas Joel,
New York, patterned after the communities they left in Europe. There are still
other, smaller, communities throughout the United States, which at first did
not have all the established institutions of the dominant community in New
York. Eventually, even they managed to put many of these institutions in place,
thereby preserving their cultural separation. With these in place, the
communities were able to grow and flourish, both because of an extremely high
birthrate (eight or more children is normal), and because of outreach programs
geared toward other Jews. Most notably the Chabad Lubavitch Hasidic movement
embraced outreach with a passion, conducting nationwide campaigns to introduce
Chabad Judaism to unaffiliated Jews, as well as to Jews of other affiliations.
This helped ignite the teshuvah movement that now attracts thousands of new
adherents to Haredi Judaism yearly. On the other hand, despite all their
efforts at cultural separation, the Haredi leadership could not ignore the
appeal of American life to their own youth. While certain few concessions to
American society were made (for example, some groups allowed some of their
children to pursue some higher education under certain circumstances), for the
most part the response was to adopt an even more extreme approach to
insularity. In effect, anything that might be perceived as a threat to the
cultural homogeneity of the community was disparaged, including secular
newspapers, radio, and television. Instead, a program of total immersion in
study was encouraged for the younger generation. Some Haredi leaders realized
that the communities could not be kept completely insular and established ways
to connect to society without compromising on their intrinsic beliefs. In
several instances, yeshivos such as Torah Vodaas, Yeshivas Rabbeinu Yitzchok
Elchonon, Chaim Berlin and Ner Yisroel started allowing the boys (or bochurim)
to pursue a secular education while remaining in the yeshiva. This was helped
largely by the establishment of Touro College by Dr. Bernard Lander, a college
based in New York City geared towards Haredi students seeking college degrees.
One of the most noticeable things in Touro is the fact that the classes are
separate for men and women to keep in line with strict Haredi lifestyles.
Another, perhaps greater threat, was seen in those Jewish groups that attempted
to bridge the gap between the religious and secular worlds, since this was
perceived as possibly more alluring to the youths of the community, including
those who could not conceive of a total break from their Jewish upbringing.
Reform, Conservative, and even Modern Orthodox Judaism were seen as threatening
to the very continuity of the community. In the case of Reform, this animosity
could be traced to the early nineteenth century in Germany, where Reform waged
a battle to wrest control of the communities from Traditional Jews. At that
time, both groups attacked each other incessantly in the struggle for hegemony
over the Jewish community. Until quite recently, the Reform movement felt
secure and was not leveling the same attacks on the Orthodox. In many
instances, they sought ways to cooperate on common issues. To the Haredim,
however, the new Judaism of the Reformers was a movement that did away with the
basic tenets of what they felt was authentic Judaism, a hoax to be disparaged
and discouraged within their own communities. The criticisms of two centuries
earlier were also applied to the Conservative community. Their beliefs and
practices were held to be incompatible with Judaism and, as such, rejected. On
an individual level, Conservative and Reform Jews are seen as "innocents led
astray" (Rabbi Moshe Feinstein), and some Haredi groups have created extensive
programs to reach out to them. However, the beliefs of these movements are
condemned as stemming from the widespread denigration of religion of the 19th
century. It is this viewpoint that defines the Haredi community's relationship
to the larger Jewish community to this day. However, the issue is more
complicated when considering their position vis Ã  vis the Modern Orthodox
community. There is a mutual dependency between the two communities: the Modern
Orthodox generally respect and adhere to the religious rulings of the Haredi
leadership, while the Haredi often depend on university trained Modern Orthodox
professionals to provide for needs that members of their own community cannot.
For example, since there are so few Haredi physicians, the community will
prefer to go to a Modern Orthodox physician, since he or she will have a better
understanding of the implications of the treatment in Jewish law ("halakha").
Nevertheless, the leadership is unwilling to accept the "liberalism" of their
Modern Orthodox colleagues. In some cases, Modern Orthodoxy is perceived as
balancing precariously on a very narrow wire between the Jewish and secular
worlds: a tenable but, to the Haredi, unnecessary position. In other cases,
Modern Orthodox leaders are considered to have passed the bounds of religious
propriety and condemned for this in severe terms, since those leaders, unlike
Reform and Conservative rabbis, are believed to have the requisite learning and
should know better. No matter how sharp the discourse, it does not have the
same intensity as earlier arguments that led to or threatened real schisms
among the Jewish people. For instance, with the rise of Hasidism, Rabbi Elijah
of Vilna declared that his followers must not marry Hasidic Jews (the ruling
was never put into practice). While there are tensions between Haredi and other
Jews, the leadership of all the factions involved have taken care to prevent a
complete break, while respecting the desire of the Haredi for autonomy and
separatism. And there is common ground too, especially in the field of
learning. It is not uncommon for Haredi scholars to take advantage of the vast
library holdings, including rare manuscripts, in the libraries of Yeshiva
University (Centrist), the Jewish Theological Seminary (Conservative), and
Hebrew Union College (Reform). Western Europe. About 25,000 Haredim live in
France (mostly Sephardim of North African descent). Important communities are
located in Paris, Strasbourg and Lyon. Other important communities, mostly
Ashkenazi, are the Jewish Community of Antwerp in Belgium, as well as
communities in the Swiss cities of Zurich and Basel, and in the Dutch city of
Amsterdam. There is also a Haredi community in Vienna, Austria. United Kingdom.
In the UK, the largest Haredi communities are located in London (Stamford Hill,
South Tottenham, Golders Green, Hendon, Edgware), Salford/Bury (Broughton Park,
Kersal, Sedgley Park and Prestwich) and Gateshead. The majority of UK Haredim
descend from Eastern-European immigrants. The Haredi community in London is
organized into a group known as the Union of Orthodox Hebrew Congregations
(UOHC). The UK Haredi community is growing, maintaining hundreds of synagogues,
although many are smaller scale shtiebels. It also maintains numerous schools,
yeshivas, kolels and mikvehs. The community also supports dozens of kosher food
shops, bakeries and to a lesser extent, restaurants. The Haredi population in
the UK was estimated at 27,000 in 1998, out of 200,000 UK observant Jews.
However, a 2007 study published by the University of Manchester asserted that
three out of every four British Jewish births are Haredi, who now account for
45,500 out of around 275,000 Jews in the UK, or 17%. A new joint study of the
Jewish Policy Research and the Board of Deputies in 2010 established that there
was 9049 Haredi households in the UK. This would account for a population of
nearly 53,400 or 20% of the UK community. (9,049 households * 5.9 average
Haredi household) Within the next three decades, the Haredi community is
predicted (by the Board of Deputies) to be the largest Jewish group in the UK:
in comparison with the national average of 2.4 children per family, Haredi
families have an average of 5.9 children, and as of 2006 membership of Haredi
synagogues had doubled since 1990.
