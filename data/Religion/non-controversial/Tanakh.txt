Tanakh The Tanakh (, or ; also "Tenakh", "Tenak", "Tanach") is a name used in
Judaism for the canon of the Hebrew Bible. The Tanakh is also known as the
Masoretic Text or the "Miqra". The name is an acronym formed from the initial
Hebrew letters of the Masoretic Text's three traditional subdivisions: The
Torah ("Teaching", also known as the Five Books of Moses), Nevi'im ("Prophets")
and Ketuvim ("Writings")â€”hence "TaNaKh". The name ""Miqra"" (××§×¨×),
meaning "that which is read", is an alternative Hebrew term for the Tanakh. The
books of the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible) were relayed with an accompanying oral
tradition passed on by each generation, called the Oral Torah. History.
According to the Talmud, much of the contents of the Tanakh were compiled by
the "Men of the Great Assembly" by 450Â BCE, and have since remained unchanged.
Modern scholars believe that the process of canonization of the Tanakh became
finalized between 200Â BCE and 200Â CE. The Hebrew text was originally an
abjad: consonants written with some applied vowel letters (""matres
lectionis""). During the early Middle Ages scholars known as the Masoretes
created a single formalized system of vocalization. This was chiefly done by
Aaron ben Moses ben Asher, in the Tiberias school, based on the oral tradition
for reading the Tanakh, hence the name Tiberian vocalization. It also included
some of Ben Naftali and Babylonian innovations. Despite the comparatively late
process of codification, some traditional sources and some Orthodox Jews
believe the pronunciation and cantillation derive from the revelation at Sinai,
since it is impossible to read the original text without pronunciations and
cantillation pauses. The combination of a text (××§×¨× "miqra"),
pronunciation (× ×™×§×•×“ "niqqud") and cantillation (×˜×¢××™× "te`amim")
enable the reader to understand both the simple meaning, as well as the nuances
in sentence flow of the text. Terminology. The three-part division reflected in
the acronym "Tanakh" is well attested to in documents from the Second Temple
period and in Rabbinic literature. During that period, however, "Tanakh" was
not used. Instead, the proper title was "Mikra" (××§×¨×, meaning "reading" or
"that which is read") because the biblical texts were read publicly. "Mikra"
continues to be used in Hebrew to this day, alongside Tanakh, to refer to the
Hebrew scriptures. In modern spoken Hebrew both are used interchangeably.
Codification of the books of Tanakh. According to the Talmud (Bava Batra 14b-
15a, Rashi to Megillah 3a, 14a), much of the contents of the Tanakh was
compiled by the Men of the Great Assembly ("Anshei K'nesset HaGedolah"), a task
completed in 450Â BCE, and have remained unchanged since that date. Evidence
suggests that the process of canonization occurred between 200Â BCE and
200Â CE. A popular position is that the Torah was canonized circa 400Â BCE, the
Prophets circa 200Â BCE, and the Writings circa 100Â CE, perhaps at a
hypothetical Council of Jamnia. This position, however, is increasingly
criticised by modern scholars. Some scholars argue that the Jewish canon was
fixed by the Hasmonean dynasty (140-37Â BCE). Today, there is no scholarly
consensus as to when the Jewish canon was set. Formal closure of the canon has
often been ascribed to Rabbinic Judaism after the destruction of the Second
Temple in 70Â CE. Heinrich Graetz proposed in 1871 that it was concluded at a
Council of Jamnia (or Yavne in Hebrew), some time in the period 70â€“90Â CE.
However, Rabbinical writings seem to indicate that certain books were disputed
as accepted canon (such as Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs and Esther, see also
Antilegomena), but it may not necessarily be the case. The implication of the
Talmud indicates that the books themselves were already accepted canon, but may
have been misunderstood on philosophical or ecclesiastical grounds. The Talmud
eliminates this misunderstanding. The twenty-four books are also mentioned in
the Midrash Koheleth 12:12. A slightly different accounting can be found in the
book "Against Apion", by the 1st-century Jewish historian Josephus, who
describes 22 sacred books: the five books of Moses, thirteen histories, and
four books of hymns to God and precepts for the conduct of human life. Some
scholars have suggested that he considered Ruth part of Judges, and
Lamentations part of Jeremiah; as the Christian translator Jerome recorded in
the 4th century CE. Other scholars suggest that at the time Josephus wrote,
such books as Esther and Ecclesiastes were not yet considered canonical. Books
of the Tanakh. The Tanakh consists of twenty-four books: it counts as one book
each Samuel, Kings, Chronicles and Ezra-Nehemiah and counts Trei Asar (×ª×¨×™
×¢×©×¨, the Twelve Prophets; literally "twelve") as a single book. Most
versions of the Christian Old Testament count Samuel, Kings, Chronicles and
Ezra-Nehemiah as two books each, and the "Twelve Prophets" (or the minor
prophets) as 12 books, giving rise to a count of 39 books for the Old
Testament. Torah. The Torah (×ªÖ¼×•Ö¹×¨Ö¸×”, literally "teaching") consists of
five books, commonly referred to as the "Five Books of Moses". Printed versions
of the Torah are often called "Chamisha Chumshei Torah" (×—××™×©×” ×—×•××©×™
×ª×•×¨×”, literally the "five five-sections of the Torah"), and informally a
"Chumash". Nevi'im. "Nevi'im" (× Ö°×‘Ö´×™×Ö´×™×, "Prophets") consists of
eight books. This division includes the books which, as a whole, cover the
chronological era from the entrance of the Israelites into the Land until the
Babylonian captivity of Judah (the "period of prophecy"). However, they exclude
Chronicles, which covers the same period, as well as Ruth. The "Nevi'im" are
often divided into the Earlier Prophets (× ×‘×™××™× ×¨××©×•× ×™×), which
are generally historical in nature, and the Later Prophets (× ×‘×™××™×
××—×¨×•× ×™×), which contain more exhortational prophecies. Ketuvim.
"Ketuvim" (×›Ö°Ö¼×ª×•Ö¼×‘Ö´×™×, "Writings") are sometimes also known by the
Greek title "Hagiographa" and consists of eleven books. These encompass all the
remaining books, and include the Five Megillot (Five Scrolls). They are
sometimes also divided into such categories as "Sifrei Emet" (×¡×¤×¨×™ ×××ª,
literally "Books of Truth") of Psalms, Proverbs and Job (the Hebrew names of
these three books form the Hebrew word for "truth" as an acrostic, and all
three books have unique cantillation marks), the "wisdom books" of Job,
Ecclesiastes, and Proverbs, the "poetry books" of Psalms, Lamentations and Song
of Songs, and the "historical books" of Ezra-Nehemiah and Chronicles. Chapters
and verse numbers, book divisions. The chapter divisions and verse numbers have
no significance in the Jewish tradition. Nevertheless, they are noted in all
modern editions of the Tanakh so that verses may be located and cited. The
division of Samuel, Kings, and Chronicles into parts I and II is also indicated
on each page of those books in order to prevent confusion about whether a
chapter number is from part I or II, since the chapter numbering for these
books follows their partition in the Christian textual tradition. Nevertheless,
because they proved useful for citations, they are often included in most
Hebrew editions of the biblical books. For more information on the origin of
these divisions, see chapters and verses of the Bible. Jews don't necessarily
reference the specific verse in a chapter (older editions of the Talmud cite
only chapter numbers), and some works cite the sectional divisions in the
Torah. The chapter and verse numbers were often indicated very prominently in
older editions, to the extent that they overshadowed the traditional Jewish
masoretic divisions. However, in many Jewish editions of the Tanakh published
over the past forty years, there has been a major trend towards minimizing the
impact and prominence of the chapter and verse numbers on the printed page.
Most editions accomplish this by removing them from the text itself and
relegating them to the margins of the page. The main text in these editions is
unbroken and uninterrupted at the beginning of chapters (which are noted only
in the margin). The lack of chapter breaks within the text in these editions
also serves to reinforce the visual impact created by the spaces and
"paragraph" breaks on the page, which indicate the traditional Jewish parashah
divisions. Some versions have even introduced a new chapter system . These
modern Jewish editions present Samuel, Kings, and Chronicles (as well as Ezra)
as single books in their title pages, and make no indication inside the main
text of their division into two parts (though it is noted in the upper and side
margins). In such editions, the second books of Samuel, Kings and Chronicles
follow the respective first books on the very same page, with no special break
at all in the flow of the text. In the case of Kings, in which no parashah
division appears at this point, the text of II Kings continues that of I Kings
on the very same line of text. Jewish (Hebrew) editions have a different
pattern regarding Chronicles (I Chronicles) chapters 5 and 6. In I Chronicles
(in Christian sources) chapter 5 ends at verse 41. Chronicles (Jewish editions
of Chronicles) 5:27-41 is equivalent to First Chronicles 6: 1-15 in most
English translations. In Jewish (Hebrew) editions 6:1 is equivalent to 6:16 and
therefore the chapter ends at Chronicles 6:66 instead of the First Chronicles
6:81 (English translations) and at 7:1 both Hebrew and English versions set off
from the same starting point once more. This difference offsets other more
contextual differences. The Jewish Tanakh is the same as the Christian Hebrew
Old Testament and is based on careful copying of Hebrew and Aramaic manuscripts
over centuries. Jewish and Christian translations often differ. For example,
some Christians translate the word "almah" (×¢×œ××”) as "virgin," while Jews
tend to the translation "young maiden". Christian views are based on exegesis
of the Isaiah passage and Matthew's interpretation, which also agrees with the
ancient Jewish Septuagint translation, , which according to some New Testament
Scholars, can mean "a marriageable maiden" or "virgin." Jewish commentaries on
the Bible. There are two major approaches towards study of, and commentary on,
the Tanakh. In the Jewish community, the classical approach is religious study
of the Bible, where it is assumed that the Bible is divinely inspired. Another
approach is to study the Bible as a human creation. In this approach, Biblical
studies can be considered as a sub-field of religious studies. The later
practice, when applied to the Torah, is considered heresy by the Orthodox
Jewish community. As such, much modern day Bible commentary written by non-
Orthodox authors is considered forbidden by rabbis teaching in Orthodox
yeshivas. Some classical rabbinic commentators, such as Abraham Ibn Ezra,
Gersonides, and Maimonides, used many elements of contemporary biblical
criticism, including their knowledge of history, science, and philology. Their
use of historical and scientific analysis of the Bible was considered kosher by
historic Judaism due to the author's faith commitment to the idea that God
revealed the Torah to Moses on Mount Sinai. The modern Orthodox Jewish
community allows for a wider array of biblical criticism to be used for
biblical books outside of the Torah, and a few Orthodox commentaries now
incorporate many of the techniques previously found in the academic world, e.g.
the Da'at Miqra series. Non-Orthodox Jews, including those affiliated with
Conservative Judaism and Reform Judaism, accept both traditional and secular
approaches to Bible studies. "Jewish commentaries on the Bible", discusses
Jewish Tanakh commentaries from the Targums to classical rabbinic literature,
the midrash literature, the classical medieval commentators, and modern day
commentaries.
