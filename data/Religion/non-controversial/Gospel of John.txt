Gospel of John The Gospel According to John (Greek œÑ·Ω∏ Œ∫Œ±œÑ·Ω∞
·º∏œâŒ¨ŒΩŒΩŒ∑ŒΩ Œµ·ΩêŒ±Œ≥Œ≥Œ≠ŒªŒπŒøŒΩ), commonly referred to as the Gospel of
John or simply John and often referred to in New Testament scholarship as the
Fourth Gospel, is an account of the public ministry of Jesus. It begins with
the witness and affirmation by John the Baptist and concludes with the death,
burial, Resurrection, and post-Resurrection appearances of Jesus. This account
is fourth of the canonical gospels, after the synoptics Matthew, Mark and Luke.
Raymond E. Brown did pioneering work to trace the development of the tradition
from which the gospel arose. The discourses seem to be concerned with the
actual issues of the church-and-synagogue debate at the time when the Gospel
was written "c." AD 90. It is notable that, in the gospel, the community still
appears to define itself primarily against Judaism, rather than as part of a
wider Christian church. Though Christianity started as a movement within
Judaism, gradually Christians and Jews became bitterly opposed. John presents a
"higher" Christology than the synoptics, meaning that he describes Jesus as the
incarnation of the divine Logos through whom all things were made, as the
object of veneration, and more explicitly as God incarnate. Only in John does
Jesus talk at length about himself and his divine role, often shared with the
disciples only. Against the synoptics, John focuses largely on different
miracles (including resurrecting Lazarus), given as signs meant to engender
faith. Synoptic elements such as parables and exorcisms are not found in John.
It presents a realized eschatology in which salvation is already present for
the believer. The historical reliability of John is debated, particularly by
secular scholarship. In contrast, Grace-oriented churches argue for the total
pre-eminence of John. Composition. Authorship. The gospel identifies its author
as "the disciple whom Jesus loved." The text does not actually name this
disciple, but by the beginning of the 2nd century a tradition began to form
which identified him with John the Apostle, one of the Twelve (Jesus's
innermost circle). Although some notable New Testament scholars affirm
traditional Johannine scholarship, the majority do not believe that John or one
of the Apostles wrote it, and trace it instead to a "Johannine community" which
traced its traditions to John; the gospel itself shows signs of having been
composed in three "layers", reaching its final form about 90-100 AD. According
to the Church Fathers, the Bishops of Asia Minor requested John, in his old
age, to write a gospel in response to Cerinthus, the Ebionites and other Hebrew
groups which they deemed heretical. This understanding remained in place until
the end of the 18th century. There is also some evidence that John might not
have written the "Book of John" and it was wrongly attributed to him, in the
book "The Disciple Whom Jesus Loved". For instance, the writing style is
different, the author for reasons of humility refers to himself instead as "the
disciple whom Jesus loved," while John in Revelations refers to himself as John
at least five times. Also, the writer of the Fourth Gospel, refers to the Sons
of Zebedee (that is, James and John), while in a fishing trip after Jesus's
death, refers to these two, but also refers to this "other disciple". This
disciple is never mentioned as even being there in any of the common sections
to other gospels, and is never mentioned at all until after Lazarus is raised.
The author contends that Lazarus was the likely writer of the Fourth Gospel,
and used the pseudonym because his sudden celebrity after being raised was
detracting from Jesus's message. This also seems to work, given the fact that
this "other disciple" believed when seeing the linens in Jesus's tomb, Lazarus,
having been raised himself would have known what this means. In view of this
complex and multi-layered history it is meaningless to speak of a single
"author" of John, but the title perhaps belongs best to the evangelist who came
at the end of this process. The final composition's comparatively late date,
and its insistence upon Jesus as a divine being walking the earth in human
form, renders it highly problematical to scholars who attempt to evaluate
Jesus' life in terms of literal historical truth. Sources. Order of material.
Chapter 5 deals with a visit to Jerusalem, and chapter 7 opens with Jesus again
in Galilee since "he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill
him" ‚Äî a consequence of the incident in Jerusalem described in chapter 5.
There are more proposed rearrangements. Signs gospel. One possible construction
of the "internal evidence" states that the Beloved Disciple wrote an account of
the life of Jesus. However, this disciple died unexpectedly, necessitating that
a revised gospel be written. It may be that John ‚Äúis the source" of the
Johannine tradition but "not the final writer of the tradition." Therefore,
scholars are no longer looking for the identity of a single writer but for
numerous authors whose authorship has been absorbed into the gospel's
development over a period of time and in several stages. The hypothesis of the
Gospel being composed in layers over a period of time had its start with Rudolf
Bultmann in 1941. Bultmann suggested that the author(s) of John depended in
part on an author who wrote an earlier account. This hypothetical "Signs
Gospel" listing Christ's miracles was independent of, and not used by, the
synoptic gospels. It was believed to have been circulating before the year 70
AD. Bultmann's conclusion was so controversial that heresy proceedings were
instituted against him and his writings. (See: Images of Jesus and more
detailed discussions linked below.) Nevertheless, scholars such as Raymond
Edward Brown continue to consider this hypothesis a plausible possibility. They
believe the original author of the "Signs Gospel" to be the Beloved Disciple.
They argue that the disciple who formed this community was both an historical
person and a companion of Jesus Christ. Brown goes one step further by
suggesting that the Beloved Disciple had been a follower of John the Baptist
before joining Jesus. Discourses. The author may have used a source consisting
of lengthy discourses, but this issue has not been clarified. Inspiration. The
author has Jesus foretell that new knowledge will come to his followers after
his death. This reference indicates that the author may have included new
information, not previously revealed, that is derived from spiritual
inspiration rather than from historical records or recollection. The Trimorphic
Protennoia. In terminology close to that found in later Gnostic works, one
tract, generally known as "The Trimorphic Protennoia", must either be dependent
on John or the other way round." Date. The gospel was apparently written near
the end of the 1st century. Bart Ehrman argues that there are differences in
the composition of the Greek within the Gospel, such as breaks and
inconsistencies in sequence, repetitions in the discourse, as well as passages
that he believes clearly do not belong to their context, and believes that
these suggest redaction. The so-called "Monarchian Prologue" to the Fourth
Gospel (c. 200) supports AD 96 or one of the years immediately following as to
the time of its writing. Scholars set a range of c. 90‚Äì100. The gospel was
already in existence early in the 2nd century. John was composed in stages
(probably two or three). Since the middle of the 2nd century writings of Justin
Martyr use language very similar to that found in the Gospel of John, the
Gospel is considered to have been in existence at least at that time. The
Rylands Library Papyrus P52, which records a fragment of this gospel, is
usually dated to the first half of the 2nd century. Conservative scholars
consider internal evidences, such as the lack of the mention of the destruction
of the Temple and a number of passages that they consider characteristic of an
eyewitness, sufficient evidence that the gospel was composed before 100 and
perhaps as early as 50‚Äì70: in the 1970s, scholars Leon Morris and John A.T.
Robinson independently suggested such earlier dates for the gospel's
composition. The noncanonical Dead Sea Scrolls suggest an early Jewish origin,
parallels and similarities to the Essene Scroll, and Rule of the Community.
Many phrases are duplicated in the Gospel of John and the Dead Sea Scrolls.
These are sufficiently numerous to challenge the theory that the Gospel of John
was the last to be written among the four Gospels and that it shows marked non-
Jewish influence. Textual history and manuscripts. Probably the earliest
surviving New Testament manuscript, Rylands Library Papyrus P52 is a Greek
papyrus fragment discovered in Egypt in 1920 (now at the John Rylands Library,
Manchester). Although P52 has no more than 114 legible letters, it must come
from a substantial codex book; as it is written on both sides in a generously
scaled script, with on one side and on the other. The surviving text agrees
closely with that of the corresponding passages in the Gospel of John, but it
cannot necessarily be assumed that the original manuscript contained the full
Gospel of John in its canonical form. Metzger and Aland list the probable date
for this manuscript as "c." 125 but the difficulty of estimating the date of a
literary text based solely on paleographic evidence must allow potentially for
a range that extends from before 100 to well into the second half of the 2nd
century. P52 is small, and although a plausible reconstruction can be attempted
for most of the fourteen lines represented, the proportion of the text of the
Gospel of John for which it provides a direct witness is so small that it is
rarely cited in textual debate. Other notable early manuscripts of John include
Papyrus 66 and Papyrus 75, in consequence of which a substantially complete
text of the Gospel of John exists from the beginning of the 3rd century at the
latest. Hence the textual evidence for the Gospel of John is commonly accepted
as both earlier and more reliable than that for any other of the canonical
Gospels. Much current research on the textual history of the Gospel of John is
being done by the International Greek New Testament Project. Egerton gospel.
The mysterious Egerton Gospel appears to represent a parallel but independent
tradition to the Gospel of John. According to scholar Ronald Cameron, it was
originally composed some time between the middle of the 1st century and early
in the 2nd century, and it was probably written shortly before the Gospel of
John. Liberal scholar Robert W. Funk and the Jesus Seminar place the Egerton
fragment in the 2nd century, perhaps as early as 125, which would make it as
old as the oldest fragments of John. Position in the New Testament. In the
standard order of the canonical gospels, John is fourth, after the three
interrelated synoptic gospels Matthew, Mark and Luke. In the earliest surviving
gospel collection, Papyrus 45 of the 3rd century, it is placed second in the
order Matthew, John, Luke and Mark, an order which is also found in other very
early New Testament manuscripts. In syrcur it is placed third in the order
Matthew, Mark, John and Luke. Narrative summary (structure and content). After
the prologue, the narrative of the gospel begins with verse 6, and consists of
two parts. The first part relates Jesus' public ministry from John the Baptist
recognizing him as the Lamb of God to the raising of Lazarus and Jesus' final
public teaching. In this first part, John emphasizes seven of Jesus' miracles,
always calling them "signs." The second part presents Jesus in dialogue with
his immediate followers and gives an account of his Passion and Crucifixion and
of his appearances to the disciples after his Resurrection. In the "appendix",
Jesus restores Peter after his denial, predicts Peter's death, and discusses
the death of the "beloved disciple". Raymond E. Brown, a scholar of the social
environment where the Gospel and Letters of John emerged, labeled the first and
second parts the "Book of Signs" and the "Book of Glory", respectively. Hymn to
the Word. This prologue is intended to identify Jesus as the eternal Word
(Logos) of God. Thus John asserts Jesus' innate superiority over all divine
messengers, whether angels or prophets. Here John adapts the doctrine of the
Logos, God's creative principle, from Philo, a 1st-century Hellenized Jew.
Philo had adopted the term Logos from Greek philosophy, using it in place of
the Hebrew concept of Wisdom ("sophia") as the intermediary ("angel") between
the transcendent Creator and the material world. Some scholars argue that the
prologue was taken over from an existing hymn and added at a later stage in the
gospel's composition. Seven Signs. This section recounts Jesus' public
ministry. It consists of seven miracles or "signs," interspersed with long
dialogues and discourses, including several "I am" sayings. The miracles
culminate with his most potent, raising Lazarus from the dead. In John, it is
this last miracle, and not the temple incident, that prompts the authorities to
have Jesus executed. Last teachings and death. This section opens with an
account of the Last Supper that differs significantly from that found in the
synoptics. Here, Jesus washes the disciples feet instead of ushering in a new
covenant of his body and blood. This account of foot washing might refer to a
local tradition by which foot washing served as a Christian initiation ritual
rather than baptism. John then devotes almost five chapters to farewell
discourses. Jesus declares his unity with the Father, promises to send the
Paraclete, describes himself as the "real vine," explains that he must leave
(die) before the Holy Spirit comes, and prays that his followers be one.
Bultmonn said, ‚ÄúAs from now on there are only believers and unbelievers, so
there are also now only saved and lost, those who have life and those who are
in death‚Äù ‚Äì Rudolf Bultmann, The Gospel of John, p.¬ 155 The Jesus Seminar
has argued that verses represent a conclusion, and that the next three chapters
have been inserted into the text later. This argument considers the farewell
discourse not to be authentic, and postulates that it was constructed after the
death of Jesus. However, scholars such as Herman Ridderbos see John 14:30-31 as
a "provisional ending" just to that part of the discourse and not an ending to
the entire discourse. In 2004 Scott Kellum published a detailed analysis of the
literally unity of the entire Farewell Discourse and stated that it shows that
it was written by a single author, and that its structure and placement within
the Gospel of John is consistent with the rest of that gospel. John then
records Jesus' arrest, trial, execution, and resurrection appearances,
including "doubting Thomas." Significantly, John does not have Jesus claim to
be the Son of God or the Messiah before the Sanhedrin or Pilate, and he omits
the traditional earthquakes, thunder, and midday darkness that were said to
accompany Jesus' death. The gospel also omits Jesus' ascenion. John's
revelation of divinity is Jesus' triumph over death, the eighth and greatest
sign. , in which the "beloved disciple" claims authorship, is commonly assumed
to be an appendix, probably added to allay concerns after the death of the
beloved disciple. There had been a rumor that the End would come before the
beloved disciple died. Detailed contents. "Hymn to the Word" "Book of Signs",
"Seven Signs" "Book of Glory", "Last Teachings and Death" Characteristics of
the Gospel of John. Though the three Synoptic Gospels share a considerable
amount of text, over 90% of John's Gospel is unique to him. The synoptics
describe much more of Jesus' life, miracles, parables, and exorcisms. However,
the materials unique to John are notable, especially in their effect on modern
Christianity. The Prologue is a hymn identifying Jesus as the Logos and as God.
The Book of Signs recounts Jesus' public ministry, and includes the signs
worked by Jesus and some of his teachings. The Passion narrative recounts the
Last Supper (focusing on Jesus' farewell discourse), Jesus' arrest and
crucifixion, his burial, and resurrection. The Epilogue records a resurrection
appearance of Jesus to the disciples in Galilee. Following on from "the higher
criticism" of the 19th century, Adolf von Harnack and Raymond E. Brown have
questioned the gospel of John as a reliable source of information about the
historical Jesus. Christology. According to one scholar, John portrays Jesus
Christ as "a brief manifestation of the eternal Word, whose immortal spirit
remains ever-present with the believing Christian." The book presents Jesus as
the divine Son of God, and yet subordinate to God the Father. The gospel gives
far more focus to the relationship of the Son to the Father than the other
gospels and it has often been used in the Christian development and
understanding of the Trinity. John includes far more direct claims of Jesus
being a Son of God than the Synoptic Gospels. The gospel also focuses on the
relation of the Redeemer to believers, the announcement of the Holy Spirit as
the Comforter (Greek "Paraclete"), and the prominence of love as an element in
the Christian character. Jesus' divine role. Critical scholars think that these
claims represent the Christian community's faith in Jesus' divine authority but
doubt that the historical Jesus actually made these sweeping claims. Spong
argued that the "I Am" statements are in reference to YHWH, and interpreted as
meaning that Jesus expressly denied being God. John also promises eternal life
for those who believe in Jesus. Logos. In the Prologue, John identifies Jesus
as the Logos (Word). A term from Greek philosophy, it meant the principle of
cosmic reason. In this sense, it was similar to the Hebrew concept of Wisdom,
God's companion and intimate helper in creation. The Jewish philosopher Philo
merged these two themes when he described the Logos as God's creator of and
mediator with the material world. The evangelist adapted Philo's description of
the Logos, applying it to Jesus, the incarnation of the Logos. The opening
verse of John is translated as "the Word was with God and the Word was God" in
all orthodox and historical Bibles. There are alternative views. The explicit
statement that Jesus was himself the "Arche" does not come from John's gospel
but from the Letter to the Colossians. The Scholar's Version of the gospel,
developed by the Jesus Seminar, loosely translates the phrase as "The Logos was
what God was," offered as a better representation of the original meaning of
the evangelist. John the Baptist. John's account of the Baptist is different
from that of the synoptic gospels. John is not called "the Baptist." John's
ministry overlaps with Jesus', his baptism of Jesus is not explicitly
mentioned, but his witness to Jesus is unambiguous. The evangelist almost
certainly knew the story of John's baptism of Jesus and he makes a vital
theological use of it. He subordinates John to Jesus, perhaps in response to
members of the Baptist's sect who denied Jesus' superiority. In John, Jesus and
his disciples go to Judea early in Jesus' ministry when John has not yet been
imprisoned and executed by Herod. He leads a ministry of baptism larger than
John's own. The Jesus Seminar rated this account as black, containing no
historically accurate information. Historically, John likely had a larger
presence in the public mind than Jesus. Jews. In his Jerusalem speeches, John's
Jesus makes unfavorable references to the Jews. These references may constitute
a rebuttal on the part of the author against Jewish criticism of the early
Church. The author likely considered himself Jewish, did not deny that Jesus
and his disciples were all Jewish, and was probably speaking to a largely
Jewish community. While passages in John have been used to support anti-
semitism, these passages reflect a dispute within Judaism, and it is highly
questionable whether the evangelist himself was anti-semitic. Gnostic elements.
Though not commonly understood as Gnostic, John has elements in common with
Gnosticism. Christian Gnosticism did not fully develop until the mid-2nd
century and 2nd-century Christians concentrated much effort in examining and
refuting it. To say John‚Äôs Gospel contained elements of Gnosticism is to
assume that Gnosticism had developed to a level that required the author to
respond to it. Comparisons to Gnosticism are based not in what the author says,
but in the language he uses to say it, notably, use of the concepts of Logos
and Light. Gnostics read John but interpreted it differently than non-Gnostics.
Gnosticism taught that salvation came from "gnosis", secret knowledge, and
Gnostics did not see Jesus as a savior but a revealer of knowledge. Some
scholars assert that the gospel teaches that salvation can only be achieved
through revealed wisdom, specifically belief in (literally belief "into")
Jesus. Raymond Brown contends that "The Johannine picture of a savior who came
from an alien world above, who said that neither he nor those who accepted him
were of this world, and who promised to return to take them to a heavenly
dwelling could be fitted into the gnostic world picture (even if God's love for
the world in could not)." It has been suggested that similarities between
John's Gospel and Gnosticism may spring from common roots in Jewish Apocalyptic
literature. Historical reliability of John. The differences between the
Synoptics and John were acknowledged in the early Church. Around AD 200,
Clement of Alexandria noted that John's gospel was a "spiritual gospel",
distinct from the Synoptics. However, there is some degree of debate regarding
Clement's exact meaning of "spiritual gospel"; care must be taken not to
ascribe to his phrase modern prejudices or expectations. Critical scholarship
in the 19th century distinguished between the "biographical" approach of the
synoptics and the "theological" approach of John, and began to disregard John
as a historical source. Current scholarship, however, emphasizes that all four
gospels are both biographical and theological. According to the majority
viewpoint for most of the 20th century, Jesus' teaching in John is largely
irreconcilable with that found in the Synoptics, and scholars consider the
Synoptics to be more accurate representations of the teaching of the historical
Jesus. The teachings of Jesus in John are distinct from those found in the
synoptic gospels. Thus, since the 19th century many historical Jesus scholars
have argued that only one of the two traditions could be authentic. J. D. G.
Dunn comments on historical Jesus scholarship, "Few scholars would regard John
as a source for information regarding Jesus' life and ministry in any degree
comparable to the synoptics." E. P. Sanders concludes that the Gospel of John
contains an "advanced theological development, in which meditations of the
person and work of Jesus are presented in the first person as if Jesus said
them." Sanders points out that the author would regard the gospel as
theologically true as revealed spiritually even if its content is not
historically accurate and argues that even historically plausible elements in
John can hardly be taken as historical evidence, as they may well represent the
author's intuition rather than historical recollection. The scholars of the
Jesus Seminar identify the historical inferiority of John as foundational to
their work. Geza Vermes discounts all the teaching in John when reconstructing
his view of "the authentic gospel of Jesus." While a large number of 20th
century biblical critics argue that the teaching found in John does not go back
to the historical Jesus, they usually agree that gospel is not entirely without
historical value. Several of its independent elements are historically
plausible, such as Jesus having been executed before Passover, as John reports.
Former followers of John the Baptist probably joined Jesus' movement. It has
become generally accepted that certain sayings in John are as old or older than
their synoptic counterparts, that John's knowledge of things around Jerusalem
is often superior to the synoptics, and that his presentation of Jesus' agony
in the garden and the prior meeting held by the Jewish authorities are possibly
more historically accurate than their synoptic parallels. Recent discoveries
and trends have cast doubt on the certainty that many mid-20th century biblical
scholars had about the historical inferiority of John's Gospel. A prominent
example is the archaeological discovery of the pool of Siloam in Jerusalem in
2004‚Äîa discovery that in a small way undermines much of the criticism leveled
at John during the 20th century. Recent evidences such as the pool and a turn
away from the vestiges of positivism as evidenced by the growing number of
books addressing the historicity of John reveal that the final word has not
been said on how much of the historical Jesus inhabits John's gospel.
Throughout the 20th century a minority of prominent scholars, such as John A.T.
Robinson, have argued that John is as historically reliable as the synoptics.
Robinson wrote that, where the Gospel narrative accounts can be checked for
consistency with surviving material evidence, the account in the Gospel of John
is commonly the more plausible; that it is generally easier to reconcile the
various synoptic accounts within John's narrative framework, than it is to
explain John's narrative within the framework of any of the synoptics; and
that, where in the Gospel Jesus and his disciples are described as travelling
around identifiable locations, the trips in question can always be plausibly
followed on the ground, which he says is not the case for any synoptic Gospel.
Scholars such as D. A. Carson, Douglas J. Moo, and Craig Blomberg, often agree
with Robinson. Henry Wansbrough says: "Gone are the days when it was scholarly
orthodoxy to maintain that John was the least reliable of the gospels
historically." Development of the gospel. Some scholars today believe that
parts of John represent an independent historical tradition from the synoptics,
while other parts represent later traditions. The Gospel was probably shaped in
part by increasing tensions between synagogue and church, or between those who
believed Jesus was the Messiah and those who did not. The chronology of Jesus'
ministry in John. A distinctive feature of the Gospel of John, is that it
provides a very different chronology of Jesus' ministry from that in the
synoptics. E.P. Sanders suggests that John's chronology, even when ostensibly
more plausible, should nevertheless be treated with suspicion on the grounds
that the Synoptic accounts are otherwise superior as historic sources. C.H.
Dodd proposes that historians may mix and match between John and the synoptics
on the basis of whichever appears strongest on a particular episode. Robinson
says that John's chronology is consistently more likely to represent the
original sequence of events. Robinson offers three arguments for preferring the
chronology of John's Gospel to that of the synoptics. First, he argues that
John's account of Jesus' ministry is always consistent, in that seasonal
references always follow in the correct sequence, geographical distances are
always consistent with indications of journey times, and references to external
events always cohere with the internal chronology of Jesus' ministry. He claims
that the same cannot be claimed for any of the three Synoptic accounts. For
example, the harvest-tide story of is shortly followed by reference to green
springtime pasture at . Again, the historically consistent reference to the
period of the temple construction in , may be contrasted with the impossibility
of reconciling Luke's account of the census of with historic records of
Quirinius's governorship of Syria. Second, Robinson appeals to the critical
principle, widely applied in textual study, that the account is most likely to
be original that best explains the other variants. He argues that would be
relatively easy to have created the Synoptic chronology by selecting and
editing from John's chronology; whereas expanding the Synoptic chronology to
produce that found in John, would have required a wholescale rewriting of the
sources. Third, Robinson claims that elements consistent with John's
alternative chronology can be found in each of the Synoptic accounts, whereas
the contrary is never the case. Hence, Mark's explicit claim that the Last
Supper was a Passover meal is contraindicated by his statement that Joseph of
Arimathea bought a shroud for Jesus on Good Friday; which would not have been
possible if it were a festival day. A two-year ministry. In John's Gospel, the
public ministry of Jesus extends over rather more than two years. At the start
of his ministry Jesus is in Jerusalem for Passover, then he is in Galilee for
the following Passover, before going up to Jerusalem again for his death at a
third Passover. The synoptics by contrast only explicitly mention the final
Passover, and their accounts are commonly understood as describing a public
ministry of less than a year. Recent studies in ancient narrative
historiography argue that it is possible for John's Gospel to record multiple
Passovers‚Äîas historical testimony not theological literary-devices‚Äîand yet
not represent three years as it was not uncommon for ancient historians to
organize their histories without an absolute timeline. If true this would mean
John's chronology is much closer to Synoptic chronology than often assumed. In
favour of the Synoptic chronology, E.P Sanders observes that a short ministry
accords with the careers of other known prophetic figures of the time‚Äîwho
appear in the desert, raise large scale public interest, but soon come to a
bloody end at the hand of the Roman military. In favour of the two-year
ministry, John Robinson points out that both Matthew and Luke imply that Jesus
was preaching in Galilee for at least one Passover during his ministry. The
Temple tax is only collected at Passover; moreover, the massacred Galileans of
would appear to have been in Jerusalem for Passover, as this was the only
pilgrim feast where the faithful slaughtered their animals themselves. The
cleansing of the Temple. In John, Jesus drives the money changers from the
Temple at the start of his ministry, whereas in the Synoptic account this
occurs at the end, immediately after Palm Sunday. In favor of the later dating
of the synoptics, Geza Vermes says that this event provides a clear context and
pretext for Jesus' arrest, trial and execution. It makes more sense to suppose
that events proceeded quickly. Robinson says that all three Synoptic accounts
explain the reluctance of the Temple authorities to arrest Jesus on the spot,
as being due to their fear of popular support for John the Baptist. This would
make more sense while the Baptist was still alive. An earlier baptizing
ministry in Judea. In of the Gospel of John, Jesus, following his encounter
with John the Baptist, undertakes an extended and successful baptizing ministry
in Judea and on the banks of the River Jordan; initially as an associate of the
Baptist, latterly more as a rival. In the Synoptic accounts, Jesus retreats
into the wilderness following his baptism, and is presented as gathering
disciples from scratch in his home country of Galilee; following which he
embarks on a ministry of teaching and healing, in which baptism plays no part.
In favour of the Synoptic account is the clear characterisation of Jesus and
his disciples in all the Gospels as predominantly Galilean. Against this,
Robinson points out that all the synoptics are agreed that, when Jesus arrives
in Jerusalem in the week before his death, he already has a number of followers
and disciples in the city, notably Joseph of Arimathea, and the unnamed
landlord of the upper room, who knows Jesus as 'the Master'. Repeated visits to
Jerusalem. In John, Jesus not only starts his ministry in Jerusalem, he returns
there for other festivals, notably at and at . As noted above, E.P Sanders
regards the short, sharp prophetic career as having greater verisimilitude.
Against this John Robinson notes the numerous instances in the Synoptic account
of Jesus' final days in Jerusalem, when it is implied that he has been there
before. In two of the synoptics ( and ), Jesus appears to recall several
previous preaching ministries in Jerusalem, when his message had nevetheless
been generally spurned. The date of the crucifixion. In the Jewish calendar,
each day runs from sunset to sunset, and hence the Last Supper (on the Thursday
evening), and Jesus's crucifixion (on Friday afternoon), both fell on the same
day. In John, this day was the 14th of Nisan in the Jewish calendar; that is
the day on the afternoon of which the Passover victims were sacrificed in the
Temple, which was also known as the Day of Preparation. The Passover meal
itself would then have been eaten on the Friday evening (i.e. the next day in
Jewish terms), which would also have been a Sabbath. In the Synoptic accounts,
the Last Supper is a Passover meal, and so Jesus's trial and crucifixion must
have taken place during the night time and following afternoon of the festival
itself, the 15th of Nisan. In favour of the Synoptic chronology is that in the
earliest Christian traditions relating to the Last Supper in the first letter
of Paul to the Corinthians, there is a clear link between Passion of Jesus, the
Last Supper and the Passover lamb. In favor of John's chronology is the near
universal modern scholarly agreement that the Synoptic accounts of a formal
trial before the Sanhedrin on a festival day are historically impossible. By
contrast, an informal investigation by the High Priest and his cronies (without
witnesses being called), as told by John, is both historically possible in an
emergency on the day before a festival, and accords with the external evidence
from Rabbinic sources that Jesus was put to death on the Day of Preparation for
the Passover. Astronomical reconstruction of the Jewish Lunar calendar tends to
favor John's chronology, in that the only year during the governorship of
Pontius Pilate when the 15th Nisan is calculated as falling on a Wednesday/
Thursday was 27 CE, which appears too early as the year of the crucifixion,
whereas the 14th of Nisan fell on a Thursday/Friday in both 30 CE and 33 CE.
John and the synoptics compared. Comparison Chart of the Major Gospels. The
material in the Comparison Chart is from the "Gospel Parallels" by B. H.
Throckmorton, "The Five Gospels" by R. W. Funk, "The Gospel According to the
Hebrews", by E. B. Nicholson and "The Hebrew Gospel and the Development of the
Synoptic Tradition" by J. R. Edwards. History. John was written somewhere near
the end of the 1st century, probably in Ephesus, in Roman Asia. The tradition
of John the Apostle was strong in Asia, and Polycarp of Smyrna reportedly knew
him. Like the previous gospels, it circulated separately until Irenaeus
proclaimed all four gospels to be scripture. Although the Church Fathers
Polycarp and Ignatius of Antioch did not mention this gospel, it is thought
that its ideas are reflected in their writings. The gospel appears to have been
familiar to Papias of Hierapolis, and was used by other early Christians,
including the author of the Muratorian Canon, the Christians of Vienna and
Lugdunum, Theophilus of Antioch, Tatian and Justin Martyr. formula_1,
formula_2, formula_3, formula_4 are early papyri of the Gospel of John. In the
2nd century, the two main, conflicting expressions of Christology were John's
Logos theology, according to which Jesus was the incarnation of God's eternal
Word, and adoptionism, according to which Jesus was "adopted" as God's Son.
Christians who rejected Logos Christology were called "Alogi," and Logos
Christology won out over adoptionism. The Gospel of John was the favorite
gospel of Valentinus, a 2nd-century Gnostic leader. His student Heracleon wrote
a commentary on the gospel, the first gospel commentary in Christian history.
In the Diatesseron, the content of John was merged with the content of the
synoptics to form a single gospel that included nearly all the material in the
four canonical gospels. When Irenaeus proposed that all Christians accept Mark,
Matthew, Luke, and John as orthodox, and only those four gospels, he regarded
John as the primary gospel, due to its high Christology. Jerome translated John
into its official Latin form, replacing various older translations. Although
harmonious with the Synoptic Gospels and probably primitive (the Didascalia
Apostolorum definitely refers to it and it was probably known to Papias), the
Pericope Adulterae is not part of the original text of the Gospel of John.
Representations. The Gospel of John has influenced Impressionist painters,
Renaissance artists and classical art, literature and other depictions of
Jesus, with influences in Greek, Jewish and European history. It has been
depicted in live narrations and dramatized in productions, skits, plays, and
passion plays, productions, as well as on film. The most recent film portrayal
being that of 2003's 'The Visual Bible: The Gospel of John', directed by Philip
Saville and narrated by Christopher Plummer, and starring Henry Ian Cusick as
Jesus.
