Iguvine Tablets The Iguvine Tablets are a series of seven bronze tablets
discovered at Iguvium (contemporary Gubbio), Italy, in the year 1444. They are
also known as "Eugubian tablets". The earliest tablets were probably written in
the 3rd century BC in the native Umbrian alphabet, the latest in the 1st
century BC in the Latin alphabet. The tablets contain religious inscriptions
that memorialize the acts and rites of the Atiedian Brethren, a group of 12
priests of Jupiter with important municipal functions at Iguvium. They are
written in the Umbrian language, one of the Italic languages, a not-too-distant
relative of Latin. They are by far the longest and most important document of
the Umbrian language and also of all Osco-Umbrian family languages. They shed
light on the grammar of this ancient dead language, and also on the religious
practices of the ancient peoples of Italy, including the archaic religion of
the Romans. Part of the last tablets, namely of tablet VI and VII appear to be
written in an accentual metre, similar to the Saturnian metre that is
encountered in the earliest Latin poetry. The complete text, together with a
translation into Latin, was published in London in 1863 by Francis Newman and
1931 in a book by Albrecht von Blumenthal. The extraordinary value of these
documents is underlined by the great number of scholars who, since their
discovery, have devoted their efforts to reading and deciphering the tablets.
Their value also lies in the fact that they are the only extant documents of
the ancient religions of Europe and the Mediterranean which has come down to us
in a complete state. Moreover, their content deals with the rituals (sacrifices
and prayers) addressed to the highest gods of the local community and may
reflect to some extent the common religious beliefs and practices of the Italic
peoples. As historical linguist Giacomo Devoto once described it, it is
necessary to go deep into Asia to find anything of equal value. Also the
religious structure present in the Tablets resembles that of the early stage of
Roman religion, reflecting the Roman archaic triad and the group of gods more
strictly related to Jupiter. Although the general meaning of the tablets is
clear, there are still many obscure or debated points and issues. The main
difficulty in understanding the meaning of the text is the insufficient
knowledge of the Umbrian vocabulary. Discovery. A farmer found the tablets in a
field sometime in the medieval period (1441) and sold them to the city for 2
years' worth of farming rights.The tablets speak of the town's organization,
its boundaries and the religions and ceremonies that were celebrated there.
Epigraphic note. The tablets are engraved on bronze. The analysis of the
external appearance of the supporting material has led scholars to conclude
that only tablets V, VI and VII were meant to be exposed in public. The other
ones were cast as an archive document. They are inscribed in Italic alphabet
derived from Etruscan (T. I to Vb 8) and in Latin alphabet (T. Vb 9, VI, VII).
Dating. The study of the "ductus" (writing style), conducted by comparing the
tablets with other inscriptions from the area of Central Italy, has allowed
scholars to conclude for a dating from no later than the end of the III century
for T. III and IV to the first half of the I century for the latest T. VI and
VII. Content. Tablets I to V present their topic in a concise, matter of fact
manner. Tablets VI and VII repeat the same subject of Tablet I in a much more
detailed and diluted way, with apparent literary and encomiastic overtones. The
content of the tablets is given below in their relative order of antiquity as
established by Newman on the authority of Aufrecht and Kirchhoff, order which
is identical to that recently indicated by A. Maggiani. Tablets III and IV.
Sacrifice to "Puemonos Popricos" and "Vesuna". General prescriptions concerning
the holding of the sacrifice, sacrifice of the "ovis" (lamb) to Puemonos and
Vesuna near a sacred grove. Containing details on the choice of the "ohtur"
("auctor", head, "augur") of the ceremony, the dispositions of the ritual
instruments, the ritual invocations for the safety of the city to "Iove Patre"
and "Puemonos", the distribution of the sacrificial meat and the libations.
Tablet II. Side a (b of Lepsius) (Lacuna at the beginning of the text).
Sacrifice of an ox to "Iove Patre", of a ram to "Iovio"? ("Iuno" according to
Newman), of a lamb to "Iovio" ("Iuno") and of a boar to "Marte". The "Hondia".
Making of the "arfertur". Preparations: readying of the victim(s), grains,
"strues", "fertum" ; incense or meal, wine; salt, "mola"; "mandraculum" (white
linen used to wrap the officiant's hand), vases; pure water; ignition of the
fire at the "ara". Petronian Feast to "Hontos Iovios": sacrifice to "Hontos

regions. Sacred "Epulum" (feast) in honour of "Iove Patre", started in town and
profanated at the various "fana" with libations using the "mandraculum".
Sacrifice of a calf to "Iove Patre" for the Vocian (Lucian?) "gens" of the
Attidians. The sacrifice is conducted with the "urfeta" in one hand at the
offering and the "crencatro" (augural implement comparable to the "lituum" but
crossed (Newman), or toga wore slanted across the right shoulder(Buck)) in the
right hand at the time of the slaughtering. Tablet I. Sida a After observing
the birds on the before and the behind three oxen are sacrificed to "Iove
Grabovius" before (without) the "Trebulana Gate". Behind (within) it three sows
are sacrificed to "Trebus Iovio". Before the "Tesenaca Gate" three oxen are
sacrificed to "Marte Grabovie". Behind it three pigs are sacrificed to "Fisus
Sancius". A libation ensues. Before the "Vehiia Gate" three white fronted oxen
are sacrificed to "Vofine Grabovie". Behind the Gate three ewe lambs are
sacrificed to "Tefre Iovie". After the profanation of the lambs, the rump is
offered in expiation and a libation for the "tota", local community, ensues, on
the two sides separately starting with the right side. After the profanation of
the rumps is over the backs shall be profanated. Side b At the Jovian grove
after the shearing of sheep three male calves shall be sacrificed to "Marte
Hodie" for the Iguvine people and "tota". At the Coreties (Quiritius or
Curiatius) grove three male calves shall be sacrificed to "Hontos √áerfios".
Henceforth the citadel will be expiated. If any anything vicious happened in
the discharge of the rite the birds shall be observed, the rite shall be
reinstated once again after returning to the Trebulana Gate. Review of the city
militia and execration and expulsion of the traditional enemies by the
"arfertur" and the two "prinovatus" ("augures" or their attendants): Tadinates,
Tusci, Naherci, Iapuzcoi. Near the small fontains three red boars shall be
sacrificed to √áerfos Martios. On the Rubinian "ager" three she boars shall be
sacrificed to Prestata √áerfia of √áerfos Martios. The sacred jugs, black and
white, shall there be ordered and turned. Beyond the "Sahata" ("Sahata" is
probably the area considered within the pomerium, possibly marked by a stream)
three she calves shall be sacrificed to Tursa √áerfia of √áerfios Martios. The
assignation of the place where to carry out the slaughter of the boars shall be
decided according to the site upon which the officiant is watching, whether
either behind on the "Rubina" or beyond on the "Sahata". Three days later the
people shall be assembled and three heifers sacrificed below the Forum of
"Sehemania" ("Semonia") to "Tursa Iovia" at "Acedonia". One of the heifers
shall be consecrated by the "arfertur" and two by the "prinovatus". Tablet V.
Side a The "arfertur " must provide whatever is essential for the ceremony and
select the victims. Fees to be levied for the performance of the rites.
Whenever the banquet of the brotherhood takes place the "fratreks" or the
"cvestor" must put to votes whether the banquet was properly arranged. If the
majority of those present think it was not a further vote must be taken to fix
the penalty for the "arfertur". Side b Contributions to be made by two "gentes"
to the brethren and portions of flesh to be awarded them by the brethren on the
decurial festival. Tablet VI and VII. These two tablets repeat the content of
tablet I while expanding it to include and expound the minutest details of the
rituals. VI Side a Lustration of the "arx" Introductory auspices: as in I the
sacrifice is to be preceded by the taking of the auspices. Formulae passed
between the augur and the arfertur (legum dictio); warning against noises,
interruptions, meddling; boundaries of the augural templum; formulae of
announcement of the auspices (conspectio, nuntiatio); prescriptions applying to
the ensuing sacrifice concerning the military rod ("pirsca arsmatia"), the
disposition of the pots and the fire. 1. Sacrifice of three oxen to Iove
Grabovios before the Trebulan gate. An opening prayer is followed by three long
prayers in identical words for each of the three offerings to the three
Grabovian gods and these by a general prayer in conclusion. Then follow prayers
especially devoted to the rites connected with the sacrifice. 2. Sacrifice of
three pregnant sows to Trebos Iovios behind the Trebulan gate: the prayers used
in the first sacrifice are to be repeated. Side b 3. Sacrifice of three oxen to
Marte Grabovios before the Tesenaca gate. The prayers of the first sacrifice
are to be repeated . 4. Sacrifce of three suckling pigs to Fisus Sancius behind
the Tesenaca gate. The prayers of the first sacrifice are to be repeated. Then
an offering of cakes accompanied by specific prayers and ceremonies ensues
(involving the use of the "mandraculum", white linen cloth wrapping the right
hand of the officiant): special attention is given to Fisus Sancius, patron of
the citadel ("ocre Fisia"). 5. Sacrifice of three oxen with a white forehead
("calersuf") to Vofionos Grabovios before the Vehia gate. The prayers of the
first sacrifice are to be repeated. 6. Sacrifice of three she lambs to Tefer
Iovios behind the Vehia gate. The prayers of the first sacrifice are to be
repeated. Then supplementary offerings follow, thereafter prayers and
accompanying rites with vases on both sides of a trench. 7. Sacrifice of three
bull calves to Marte Horse at the Iovian grove. The prayers of the first
sacrifice are to be repeated. 8. Sacrifice of other three bull calves to Hondos
√áerfios at the Coredian grove. The prayers of the first sacrifice are to be
repeated. The auspices are to be taken in the same way as for the lustration of
the "arx". Holding the "perca arsmatia" (ritual staff) and the "cringatro" the
"arsfertur" lights the fire then with the two assistants ("prinovatus"), who
hold rods of pomegranate wood, marches with the victims along the Augural Way
to the district of "Acedonia". Proclamation is made expelling the alien
enemies. The Iguvines are ordered to form in companies. The "arsfertur" and the
assistants march about them thrice with the victims and the fire. At the end a
prayer is made invoking misfortune upon the aliens and blessings upon the
Iguvinians. VII Side a Sacrifice of three boars to" √áerfios Martios" at the
"Fontuli", accompanied by the prayers used at the Trebulan gate. Sacrifice of
three sows to "Praestita √áerfia" at "Rubinia", with the prayers used at the
Trebulan gate. Ceremonies with the black vessels and the white vessels, the
former meant to bring misfortune to the aliens, the latter to avert it from the
Iguvinians. Offering to Fisovius Sancius with the prayersw used behind the
Tesenaca gate. Sacrifice of three female calves beyond the "Sahata" to "Tursa
√áerfia" of the √áerfios of Marte. The prayers used at the Trebulan gate are to
be repeated. The profanation of the offerings must take place where the
"nuntiatio" happened: either in Rubinia or beyond the Sahata. After three days
the holder of the "perca arsmatia" and the two assistants pray silently for the
execration of the enemies and the safety of Iguvium from the shrine of Tursa.
Then heifers are set free below the Forum of "Sehemenia": the first person who
has caught any of the first three shall sacrifice them to "Tursa Iovia" at
"Aceronia" for Iguvium. The prayers and rituals (offer of cereals, strues,
fertum, "persea") used at the Trebulan gate are to be repeated. Side b
Obligations of the "fratrexs" and entity of the fine he must pay in case of
omissions (300 asses). The religion of the Umbrians as reflected in the Iguvine
Tablets. The triad of the Grabovii. The triad of the "Grabovii" is the highest
group of deities of the Iguvian pantheon and looks to be strictly allied to the
archaic triad of Roman religion. The epithet Grabovius seems to be related to
Etruscan "crapis", ceremonial litter, which might derive from a word meaning
oakwood. The triad is composed by "Iove" or "Iove Patre", "Marte" and
"Vofionos". The identity of the last has been understood as corresponding to
Roman gods "Quirinus" or "Liber", the former from an IE root *leudh- meaning
people, the latter either directly from the Italic theonym "Loifer" or through
the intermediary of the Italic or Etruscan interpretation of Greek god "
(Dionysos) Eleutheros", recorded also in the Etruscan theonym "Tin Luth"
(=Iuppiter Liber) of the Piacenza Liver. The gods of the triad of the Grabovii
receive in sacrifice three oxen ("buf") outside the three town gates ("Preveres
Treblanes, Tesenaces, Vehiies" before the Trebulan, Tesenacan, Vehiian Gate).
Those to be offered to Vofionos are qualified as "calersu", probably
correspondent in meaning to Latin "callidus", with a white forehead. The minor
triad. The gods of this triad receive sacrifices in correspondence with those
of the major one but these gods are honoured within the town gates. "Trebos
Iovios" corresponds to "Iove Grabovios", "Fisus Sancius" to "Marte Grabovios"
and "Tefer Iovios" to "Vofionos Grabovios". They received sacrifices of three
pregnant sows, three suckling pigs and three ewe lambs respectively. Only the
identity of the second one is known with any degree of certainty from
attestations of his existence in Rome and elsewhere in Italy. In Rome he is
known as Semo Sancus Dius Fidius. It is odd that he is here associated with
Mars while his association with Jupiter would seem more well grounded
theologically . The topic has been the object of a study by Dominique Briquel:
she opines the reason should lie in the repressive and henceforth military
connotation of the notion of divine sanction of the law. This aspect is
particularly relevant as to the divine sanction of the town wall, fact which is
of primary concern in the content of the Tablets. "Trebos" in "Trebos Iovios"
is usually understood as corresponding in meaning to Latin "trabs", ridge of
the roof. "Tefer" of "Tefer Iovios" is often explained as burner, from the IE
root *"tep" haet. This interpretation though is very debated. Both Benveniste
and Dum√©zil have argued that the Iguvine triads are just another testimony of
their three functional hypothesis of IE religion. In particular the sacrificial
offerings roughly correspond to those of Rome in their three functional
significance and the sixfold invocations of VIa 30 and 39, VIb 13 and 32
("nerf, arsmo; veiro, peiquo; castruo, fri": princes, priests; men, cattle;
fields, land produce) show a direct connexion to the sovereign, military and
productive activities. Other deities. Hondos Iovios. Many scholars, from
B√ºcheler to Prosdocimi, opine this deity is an underworld god of agricultural
fertility and plenty on the grounds of the sacrifice of puppies he receives at
his festival. Prosdocimi calls it the "intermestruae cereales": the declaration
of the dog is set at the climax of the "feriae" . J√∂rg R√ºpke remarks the
association of Hondos with Juppiter is one among the numerous in the tablets,
in which a complex multilevel and hierarchic structure of relationship among
theonyms is envisaged. This phenomenon would put the god into a sort of host-
guest relationship with the one given in the attributive. In the case of Hondos
this feature is apparent also in the fact that his cults at the Hondia festival
take place in the Jovian Grove but those at the lustration of the citadel (when
the god bears the epithet of √áerfios) in the Coredian Grove. √áerfos Martios,
Praesta(o)ta √áerfia, Tursa √áerfia, Tursa Iovia. These deities are invoked and
receive sacrifices aimed at obtaining their favour for the protection of the
"arx" itself, of the community and of the fields in connexion to the lustration
rites of the Iguvian citadel at different locations of augural relevance. The
rites concerning the "Praestota" and the two "Tursae" involve a complex of
libations aimed at obtaining a twofold action: the safety for the Iguvine
community and the offsetting and expulsion of its traditional enemies. The
debated points are few as far as the "Praestota" and "Tursa" are concerned. The
two theoyms correspond to the Latin "Iuppiter Praestes", "Iuppiter Praestitus",
"Iuppiter Praestabilis" and the "Lares Praestites". "Tursa" corresponds to god
"Terminus", being the deity that represents the boundaries of the city at
different locations of augural relevance: these are without and within the city
for "Tursa √áerfia" and "Tursa Iovia" respectively (TI I b; VII a). Such a
meaning is connected to the Umbrian word for border, "tuder": "Tursa" is
written "Tuda" in the Etruscan tablets, the intervocalic "d" being pronounced
as a weak "rs" (i.e.: ·∏ç). Dum√©zil on the other hand, on the grounds of the
function of "Tursa", a deity whose action is to scare, inspire terror into the
enemies, opines the theonym derives from a verbal root equivalent to Latin
"terreo", I scare (interpreting accordingly "tursitu, tremitu" in VIb 60).
There is no agreement among scholars on the meaning of the epithet "√áerfios"
and as to whether this is also a theonym, i. e. "√áerfos Martios" is a god
different from Mars or not. An inscription from Corfinium reads: "√áerfom
sacaracicer Semunes sua[d", "priest of the √áerfi and the Semones", placing
side by side the two categories of entities, the "√ßerfi" and the "semunes".
"√áerfos" is most times associated to IE root *ker(s) and Latin theonyms
"Ceres" and "Cerus". This view though might create interpretative problems
concerning the theology of Mars and of the two deities who in Rome are
associated with the sphere of law and defence, i. e. gods Jupiter and Semo
Sancus Dius Fidius. Georg Wissowa and Dum√©zil both underline that the
derivation from root *ker(s) is not certain: Umbrian group -"rf" could have a
different origin than -"rs". Marte Hodie; Hondos √áerfios. Marte and Hondos
appear also under these epithets. Here too the only certain indication is from
Roman "Heres" (or "Here") "Martea", connected with "heres", he who inherits and
also "dominus", the position of master of the house. The two gods both receive
sacrifices of male calves in the rites for the lustration of the citadel at the
Iovian and Coredian groves respectively; theirs are the last in the series of
sacrifices after the two triads and before the execration of the enemies. God
Hondos receives the epithet "Iovios" in II whereas of "√áerfios" in VI. This
fact raises the question of whether these epithets were used alternatively in
connexion with local or temporal constraints. Another similar instance is that
of "Tursa √áerfia" and "Tursa Iovia", who are found without and within the
"pomerium" respectively. Puemonos Pupricos and Vesuna of Puemonos Pupricos.
This divine couple appears only in tablets III and IV, the most ancient ones.
Puemonos's name seems to be related with Roman goddess Pomona; moreover both
the name itself and the epithet "Popricos" ("Publicus") hint towards a
universal fertility god, similar to Latin god Liber. Vesuna is also found on a
coin from Marsian territory. General remarks on Iguvinian theonyms. O. de
Cazanove observes Iguvinian theonyms appear to be compound formations of two,
three and four terms: they may consist of a substantive plus an epithet (e. g.
Honods Iovios, Tursa Iovia, Puemonos Podpricos), of a substantive plus a
possessive phrase plus epithet (e. g. Vesuna of Puemonos Podpricos) and of a
substantive plus epithet plus possessive phrase plus epithet (e. g. Prestota
√áerfia of √áerfios Martios, Tursa √áerfia of √áerfios Martios). In his view
this situation is comparable to that of Rome where are recorded purely
functional deities in the pontifical books. These divinities were invoked in
the prayers according to the Roman rite as mentioned by Gellius: ""Lua Saturni,
Salacia Neptuni, Hora Quirini, Virites Quirini, Maia Vulcani, Heries Iunonis,
Moles Martis, Nerio Martis"". These entities would be a concrete representation
of the powers of their respective god. At Iguvium though the situation looks
more complex and les fixed as Tursa and Hondos are alternatively √áerfian and
Martian and √áerfian and Iovian respectively. Other theonyms. Some other
deities are known just because they are mentioned occasionally in specifying
the limits of augural observation (included those of the town). These theonyms
are for the most part known in Roman religion. They are Tursa and (possibly)
Hulos in IV 17 and 19 respectively, Vestisios (Libasius) apparently god of
libations, Hoios (cf. Latin Holus, Helus, Roman grove of Helernus in Ovid
"Fasti" II 67-68) god of vegetation and Padella (cf. Roman goddess Patella),
goddess of opening sheaves in VIa 14. Possibly adjective "deueia" of "Asa
Deueia" (VIa 9, 10) implies a cult of the sky under the name "Dius", "Dia"
(Ancellotti & Cerri). Priesthoods. The Attidian brethren had an "arsfertur"
(literally equivalent to Latin "adfertor" he who carries something to
somewhere, clearly in the ceremonies, holder of the "pirca arsmatia",
ceremonial rod). Other mentioned offices include the "fratrecs" interpreted as
"curator arcae", the "cvestor" and the "prinovatus", probably agrimensors,
attendants of the person who takes the auspices. An "ohtor" ("auctor") is
mentioned in T. III and IV: the term denotes the person responsible for the
ceremony. Rites. The tablets record different sets of rites held on different
festive occasions: the main and most detailedly recorded one is the annual
lutration of the citadel ("ocre", Latin "arx") of Iguvium (Tablets I, VI and
VII). This rite includes sacrifices to the Grabovian (major) triad and the
minor one near the gates of the town, sacrifices to Marte Hodie and Hondos
√áerfios at the two sacred groves of Iove and Coredios (interpreted as
Quiritius or Curiatius) respectively, the lustral review of the people of
Iguvium in arms, i. e. the city militia, the execration and ritual expulsion of
the traditional enemies of Iguvium and final sacrifices to √áerfios Marti(os),
the Praestita √áerfia and the two Tursae, √áerfia and Iovia, at various
locations without and within the pomerium. Tablets VI and VII relate the ritual
actions such as circumabulations, libations, kneelings and dance in minute
detail recording all the prayers and the other augural formulae. The older
tablet I gives a more concise record. The ritual triple (three time)
circumambulation with fire and the victims about the city militia looks
parallel to the Roman ritual performed by king Tullius as described by
Dionysius of Halicarnassus. The most complex ceremonies are those concerning
Tefer Iovios and Fisus Sancius. A summary is appended below. Sacrifice of the
ewe lambs with the usual prayers used for each god of the two triads. Offering
of the "persondro sorsom" (suine) at the right foot of the gate with
accompanying libation. Offering of the libations. Prayer to Tefer Iovios.
Offering of the "persondro staflare" (bovine or ovine) at the left foot of the
gate. "Tripodium". Prayer repeated. Assigning of the "prosecta" (cuts of
sacrificial meat). Assigning of the libation accompanying the "persondro
sorsale " at the right foot where the "sorso" was offered to the god
(profanated). Assigning of the libation accompanying the "persondro staflare "
at the left foot as above. Burning or inhumation of the "persondro sorsale".
Burning or inhumation of the "persondro staflare". Throwing away of the vessels
used for the "persondro" during the prayer on the incense (or cereal meal).
Sacrifice of three suckling piglets with the usual prayers, consecration with
incense (or meal) and grains as at the Trebulan gate. Wearing of the
"mandraculum" (white cloth) around the right hand by the officiant. Adding of
the "ficla" and "strucla" to the "prosecta". Placing of the "sopo" (offa) at
the back. The officiant while kneeling offers the libation, the "mefa" and the
"spefa" spilling them from the vessels. Prayer for the "arx" and the community.
During the prayer libation and "tripodium". Offering of the libation.
Distribution of the "prosecta" and of the libation while kneeling. Crushing and
spilling over the fire of the "mefa", libation, "sopa" (possibly lower
entrails). Milling while sitting, prayer over the milled incense or meal. The
two profane and the two sacred jugs are disposed in rows. Tablet II records
various sacrifices to Iove, Iovio (or Iovia? Newman: Iuno) and Marte to be held
in atonement of possible unknown ritual faults; the "Hondia" festivals on which
occasion dogs were offered in sacrifice to Hondos Iovios; the feast to Hondos
Iovios held by the "gens" Petronia (these last two festivals might in fact be
one); the sacrifice and feast of the "sodalitas" of the "Fratres Atiedii" on
which rams and pigs were sacrificed to Iove by the ten sets of families of the
twelfth "pomperias", districts of Iguvium; finally the sacrifce of a calf at
the feast of Iove Patre held by the gens Vocia. The tablet might be
fragmentary, i. e. record only the final part of a ritual at its beginning. the
sum of money for the kid(s) is to be raised among the dining tables at the
published price the arfertur is to be made after observing the birds the kid

wish: wine, incense grinding of the "strues", "fertum"; spilling of the incense
or meal on the jar prayer on the whole and the ground grains the rite is
proclaimed over the sacred rite is profanated the kid(s) is burnt near the
"ara". Sacrifices of dogs were not common among ancient Italic people.
Instances in Rome include the Lupercalia and a parallel may be found in the
"Augurium Canarium" and the Robigalia, both held in late Spring for the
propitiation of a good harvest and for the preservation of the grains from
mildew respectively. According to the explanation given in Ovid by the "flamen
Quirinalis" the dog was sacrificed because at the time in which the grains in
the ears are in danger for the heat and draught the sun enters the
constellation of the Dog. Another ritual aimed at protecting corn in danger
from fires concerned foxes which were set afire in the Circus Maximus on the
last day of the "Cerialia" ("Cerealia"). Tablet III and IV record in minute
detail the rituals of the festival of Puemonos Popricos and Vesuna at a sacred
grove outside the town. Recently Michael Weiss has advanced the view that this
was a new year ritual on the grounds of comparative material. Treatment of the
offerings. Latin sources concerning the cooking of the "viscera" underline the
difference between the Etruscan and Roman costume distinguishing the "exta
aulicocta" boiled in the "olla extaris" before the offering to the god, from
the Tuscan "exta " roasted "in veru" and partly eaten during the sacrificial
rite. At Iguvium the description of some sacrificial rites documents both the
use of spits for the viscera and the presence of "prosiciae" displayed on the
table of the offerings beside the fire and perhaps consacreted and burnt to the
gods. Augury. Augural practices are presented in the tablets, most notably in
the last two ones. They include the "praeire verba", uttering of the words to
be repeated to the "arfertur", the "legum dictio", the rules for the taking of
the auspices such as silence ("silentium") and the avoidance of other
incidents, the definition of the boundaries of the augural "templum", the
"nuntiatio", announcement of the appearance of the expected signs from birds,
the circumambulation of the army with fire. Rules for the observation of bird
signs are given in VI 15-18: below a certain boundary line ("hondra esto
tudero" VIa 15) defined previously above the augur must see and hear the verse
of a "parfa" ("parrha") and a crow; above that line ("supu") he must see and
hear a woodpecker "peiqu" and a magpie "peica". Augural terminology. "Aveis
asseriates" Ia 1; "aves asseriates" VIa 1: "avibus observatis", having observed
the birds. "persnaies", "pusnaies" Ia 1: "antici, postici", (in the part)
before and behind. "dersua" VIa 1: "dextera", right hand, prosperous. The right
hand was apparently seen as auspicious in Umbria as in Greece. Newman (Appendix
II) cites the position of the augur in the inauguration of Numa, in which he
faced east while Numa faced south. Right and left have both an auspicious and
inauspicious meaning in Latin. "merstu" VIa 1: "iustissimus", rightest, most
correct, propitious, superlative of "mersos". Adjective "mersos", from
"me·∏ços", means "iustus" (cf. Oscan "meddix": supreme magistrate, "iudex").
Both words in Latin and Osco-Umbrian have a broader meaning than just, lawful:
they may mean augurally correct, favourable, in agreement with the divine
forces. "anglaf" VIa 1: "oscines", giving signs through their voice. "stiplo",
"anstiplatu" VIa 2, 3: "stipulare", "leges dicere", stipulate. "mersta auei,
mersta angla, esona" VIa 3: most propitious birds (auspices), most propitious
singing, divine. "stahmei stahmeitei" VIa 5: "statio statuta", "templum
designatum", augural templum, the designed space of augural observation. "neip
mugatu" VIa 6: "ne mugito, muttito", that nobody shall make utterances, murmur.
Silence is essential in augural practises, "nep arsir andersistu" VIa 6: "ne
divis intersistito", that nobody shall come in between, barge in, between the
divine (signs) and the augur. "disleralinsust" VIa 7: "alteravit" ("e·πõali,
erali"="alter") render irritual, impair the auspice; "attero" VII a 11, 27:
bad, unlucky. "verfale" VIa 8: "formula" of the templum. According to a new
etymology de Vaan connects this noun to Latin cognate "urbs", both having the
meaning of defined space for augural observation, from a PIE root "*u(o)rb(h)"
plus /d(h)-h(2) enclosure, enclosed area. "stahmito" VIa 8: "statutum",
designed. "tuderato" VIa 8: "finitum", defined, provided with boundaries. From
noun "tuder" boundary, Etruscan "tular". "vapersus auiehcleir" VIa 9:
"lapididibus auguralibus" (ablative), (near) at the augural stones, rocks.
"tuder" VIa 9: boundary, limit. "anclar" VIa 16: "oscines". "combifiatu" VIa
17: "conspectum capito", "nuntiato", (the augur) shall announce the appearance
of the auspices. Literally "confidato". "popler anferener" VIa 19: "populi
recensendi, lustrandi", review of the levied army. Buck cites the parallel
instance of the ritual circumbulation holding a lit torch performed by king
Tullus Hostilius in Dionysius of Halicarnassus "Roman Antiquities" IV 22.
"perca arsmatia" VIa 19: "virga ritualis", ritual (and/or military) rod. "perne
postne sepse sarsite uouse auie esone" VIb 11: "antice postice septe sarcte
voce (et) ave (i. e. auspicio) divina", from before and behind, clear and cut
(fully, wholly) voice and bird sacred. Or "...voto, augurio, sacrificio" by
vow, auspice and sacrifice. "peiqu": "picus" woodpecker; "peica" perhaps
magpie; "parfa": "parrha", perhaps "oxifraga" or upupa; "curnace": "cornix",
crow (VIa 1 etc.). "prinovatus": "legatus", assistant to the "arsfertur",
possibly "agrimensor", land-surveyor: probably from Greek œÄœÅŒπŒΩŒøœÇ, Celtic
"prinni" oakwood. "percaf poni√ßate" Ib 15; "perca poni√ßiater" VIb 51: "virgas
Punicae-mali" rods, wands of pomegranate wood. "fato fito" VIb 11: it looks
"fito" had an active meaning in Umbrian, i.e. (having) become; "fato" has been
interpreted as a passive past participle of a verb correspondin g to Latin
"fateor", thence "fato fito": having become defined by utterance. Topography.
Studies have been devoted recently to identifying the location of the rituals
described in the tablets, particularly of the "Fisian Arx", which has been
placed with certainty on Monte Ingino, to the southwest of Gubbio. Text sample.
"Jupiter Grabovius, if on the Fisian mount fire has arisen, or if in the nation
of Iguvium the owed preparations have been omitted, let it be as if they had
been made." "Jupiter Grabovius, if in your sacrifice there has been any flaw,
any defect, any ritual violation, any fraud, any error, if in your sacrifice
there is a flaw, either seen or unseen. . . " The Tablets are housed in the
Museo Civico in Gubbio, which is in the old judicial building and date from the
2nd century BC. They are written in an alphabet of Etruscan derivation.
