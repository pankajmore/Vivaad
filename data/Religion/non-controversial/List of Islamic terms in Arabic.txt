Glossary of Islam The following list consists of notable concepts that are
derived from both Islamic and Arab tradition, which are expressed as words in
the Arabic language. The main purpose of this list is to disambiguate multiple
spellings, to make note of spellings no longer in use for these concepts, to
define the concept in one or two lines, to make it easy for one to find and pin
down specific concepts, and to provide a guide to unique concepts of Islam all
in one place. Separating concepts in Islam from concepts specific to Arab
culture, or from the language itself, can be difficult. Many Arabic concepts
have an Arabic secular meaning as well as an Islamic meaning. One example is
the concept of dawah. Arabic, like all languages, contains words whose meanings
differ across various contexts. The word "Islam" is itself a good example.
Arabic is written in its own alphabet, with letters, symbols, and orthographic
conventions that do not have exact equivalents in the Latin alphabet (see
Arabic alphabet). The following list contains transliterations of Arabic terms
and phrases; variations exist, e.g. "din" instead of "deen" and "aqidah"
instead of "aqeedah". Most items in the list also contain their actual Arabic
spelling. __NOTOC__
