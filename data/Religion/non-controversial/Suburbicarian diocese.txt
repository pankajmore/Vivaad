Suburbicarian diocese The seven suburbicarian dioceses are Roman Catholic
dioceses located in the vicinity of Rome, whose (titular) bishops form the
highest-ranking order of Cardinals, the Cardinal Bishops. The see of Ostia is
conferred on the Dean of the College of Cardinals in addition to the see he
already had. (Until 1914, the Dean received the see of Ostia and Velletri in
place of the see he had earlier. The sees of Ostia and Velletri were separated
in 1914.) The Dean used to be the longest-serving cardinal bishop, but is now
chosen by the six cardinal bishops with the approval of the pope. The
increasing involvement of the Cardinal bishops in the administration of the
papal curia resulted in a detachment from their dioceses. Therefore some of
them, in particular the Bishops of Sabina and Velletri, have for centuries had
auxiliary bishops and in 1910 Pope Pius X in his constitution "Apostolicae
Romanorum" made this practice obligatory for all suburbicarian dioceses. In
1962, Pope John XXIII in his decree "Suburbicarii Sedis" turned the Cardinal
bishops into mere titular bishops and appointed diocesan bishops for Velletri-
Segni, Porto-Santa-Rufina, Frascati, Palestrina, Albano and Sabina. The diocese
of Ostia — the titular diocese of the Dean of the College of Cardinals —
was merged with the diocese of Rome and was henceforth administered by the
Roman vicar general. Though the diocesan bishops exercise all episcopal
administrative functions, the Cardinal bishops still formally take possession
of their titular dioceses.
