Revelation In religion and theology, revelation is the revealing or disclosing
of some form of truth or knowledge through supposed communication with a deity
or other supernatural entity or entities. Some religions have religious texts
which they view as divinely or supernaturally revealed or inspired. For
instance, Orthodox Judaism holds that the Torah was received from God on
biblical Mount Sinai, and Muslims consider the Qur'an to have been revealed
word by word and letter by letter. In Hinduism some Vedas are considered
apaurusheyatva, i.e. "not human compositions", and are supposed to have been
directly revealed, and thus are called Å›ruti, i.e. "what is heard". Many
Christians believe that the Old and New Testaments were inspired by God. The
15,000 handwritten pages produced by the mystic Maria Valtorta were represented
as direct dictations from Jesus, while she attributed the Book of Azariah to
her guardian angel. When a revelation is communicated by a supernatural entity
that is reported as present during the communication, it is called a vision.
Some revelations go further in that direct conversations between the recipient
and the supernatural entity is reported. Some revelations are reported along
with physical marks such as stigmata and in rare cases, such as that of Saint
Juan Diego, physical artifacts accompany the revelation. The Roman Catholic
concept of interior locution includes just an inner voice heard by the
recipient. In the Abrahamic religions, the term is used to refer to the process
by which God reveals knowledge of himself, his will, and his divine providence,
to the world of human beings. Revelation from a supernatural source is of
lesser importance in some other religious traditions, such as Taoism and
Confucianism. In secondary usage, it refers to the resulting human knowledge
about God, prophecy, and other divine things. Types. Verbal. Some people hold
that God can communicate with man in a way that gives direct, propositional
content: This is termed "verbal revelation". Orthodox Judaism and traditional
Christianity hold that the first five books of Moses were dictated by God in
such a fashion. Aristotelian rationalism. The Aristotelian scholastic
philosophers of the medieval era held that revelation was the discovery of
absolute truths about God, man, and man's place in God's universe, as
discovered through logical philosophical inquiry. A prophet's connection to God
was held to be the only way that a person could reach such a state of pure
reason. Natural. Some people believe that God reveals himself through his
creation, and that at least some truths about God can be learned by studying
nature, physics, cosmology, etc. Adherents of this belief often dismiss the
idea of divine texts or "scriptures". For, if one accepts that truth can be
determined through the study of nature, physics, cosmology, etc., then that
truth has evidently existed longer than any divine text or scripture; it has
been true, longer. Thus, natural revelation would be empiricist. In contrast,
adherents of idealism find support in Biblical verses such as "The heavens
declare the glory of God" (Psalm 19:1-4). Non-verbal propositional. One school
of thought holds that revelation is non-verbal and non-literal, yet it may have
propositional content. People were divinely inspired by God with a message, but
not in a verbal-like fashion. Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel has written that "To
convey what the prophets experienced, the Bible could either use terms of
descriptions or terms of indication. Any description of the act of revelation
in empirical categories would have produced a caricature. That is why all the
Bible does is to state that revelation happened; how it happened is something
they could only convey in words that are evocative and suggestive." However it
is contended that the Bible does indeed state exactly how certain prophets
received revelation. Such as Isaiah, who writes that he received his message
through visions, where he would see YHWH the God of Israel, speaking to angelic
beings that surrounded him. Isaiah would then write down the dialogue exchanged
between YHWH, and the angels. This form of revelation constitutes the bulk of
the text of the Book of Isaiah. The same formula of divine revelation is used
by other prophets throughout the Tanakh, such as Micaiah in 1 kings 22:19-22.
Progressive revelation. "Continuous revelation" is a term for the theological
position that God continues to reveal divine principles or commandments to
humanity. Rationalism and Deism. With the Age of Enlightenment in Europe,
beginning about the mid-17th century, the development of rationalism,
materialism and atheism, the concept of supernatural revelation itself came to
be seen in a sceptical light. Thomas Paine in "The Age of Reason" (1794â€“1809)
develops the theology of deism, rejecting the possibility of miracles and
arguing that any revelation can only be considered valid for the original
recipient. Existentialism. In the 20th century, religious existentialists
proposed that revelation held no content in and of itself; rather, they hold
that God inspired people with his presence by coming into contact with them.
Revelation is a human response that records how we responded to God. One of the
major trends in modern Jewish philosophy was the attempt to develop a theory of
Judaism through existentialism. One of the primary players in this field was
Franz Rosenzweig. His major work, "Star of Redemption", gives a philosophy in
which he portrays the relationships between God, humanity and world as they are
connected by creation, revelation and redemption. Conservative Jewish
philosophers Elliot N. Dorff and Neil Gillman take the existentialist
philosophy of Rosensweig as one of their starting points for understanding
Jewish philosophy. (They come to distinct conclusions, however.) Paul Johannes
Tillich (1886â€“1965) was a theologian and Christian existentialist
philosopher. Tillich was, along with contemporary Karl Barth, one of the more
influential Protestant theologians of the twentieth century. Tillich's approach
to Protestant theology was highly systematic. He sought to correlate culture
and faith such that "faith need not be unacceptable to contemporary culture and
contemporary culture need not be unacceptable to faith". Consequently,
Tillich's orientation is apologetic, seeking to make concrete theological
answers that are applicable to ordinary daily life. Tillich sought to reconcile
revelation and reason by arguing that revelation never runs counter to reason
(affirming Thomas Aquinas who said that faith is eminently rational), but both
poles of the subjective human experience are complementary. Tillich's radical
departure from traditional Christian theology is his view of Christ. According
to Tillich, Christ is the "New Being", who rectifies in himself the alienation
between essence and existence. Essence fully shows itself within Christ, but
Christ is also a finite man. This indicates, for Tillich, a revolution in the
very nature of being. The gap is healed and essence can now be found within
existence. Thus for Tillich, Christ is not God "per se" in himself, but Christ
is the revelation of God. Whereas traditional Christianity regards Christ as
wholly man and wholly God, Tillich believed that Christ was the emblem of the
highest goal of man, what God wants men to become. Thus to be a Christian is to
make oneself progressively "Christ-like", a very possible goal in Tillich's
eyes. According to Tillich, Christ is not God in the traditional sense, but
reveals the essence inherent in all existence. Thus Christ is not different
from mankind except insofar as he fully reveals God within his own finitude,
something that can be done by anyone, in principle. In Tillich's book
"Systematic Theology I", he argued that: "God does not exist. He is being
itself beyond essence and existence. Therefore to argue that God exists is to
deny him." Systematic theology. Systematic theology is the attempt to formulate
a coherent philosophy which is applicable to the component parts of a given
faith's system of belief. While a systematic theology must take into account
the sacred texts of its faith, it also looks to history, philosophy, science,
and ethics to produce as full a view and as versatile a philosophical approach
as possible. Thomas Aquinas believed in two types of revelation from God,
"general revelation" and "special revelation". General revelation occurs
through observation of the created order. Such observations can logically lead
to important conclusions, such as the existence of God. Though one may deduce
the existence of God and some of God's attributes through general revelation,
certain specifics may be known only through special revelation. Aquinas
believed that special revelation is equivalent to the revelation of God in
Jesus. The major theological components of Christianity, such as the Trinity
and the Incarnation, are revealed in the teachings of the church and the
scriptures and may not otherwise be deduced. Special revelation and natural
revelation are complementary rather than contradictory in nature. Karl Barth
tries to recover the Christian doctrine of the Trinity in theology from its
putative loss in liberalism. His argument follows from the idea that God is the
object of Godâ€™s own self-knowledge, and revelation in the Bible means the
self-unveiling to humanity of the God who cannot be discovered by humanity
simply through its own efforts. Note here that the Bible is not "The
Revelation", rather, it points to revelation. Barth emphasizes again and again
that human concepts can never be considered as identical to God's revelation.
In this aspect, scripture is also written in human language, expressing human
concepts. It cannot be considered as identical to God's revelation. However,
God truly reveals himself through human language and concepts. Thus he claims
that Christ is truly presented in scripture and the preaching of the church.
Revelation in various religions. Epistemology. Abrahamic religions, including
Judaism, Christianity and Islam, take it as a matter of faith that God exists,
and in some way can reveal his will to people. Members of those faiths
distinguish between true prophets and false prophets; and there are documents
offering criteria with which to distinguish true from false prophets. The
question of epistemology then arises (how to know?). In Judaism, issues of
epistemology have been addressed by Jewish philosophers such as Saadiah Gaon
(882â€“942) in his Book of Beliefs and Opinions; Maimonides (1135â€“1204) in
his Guide for the Perplexed; Samuel Hugo Berman, professor of philosophy at the
Hebrew University; Joseph Dov Soloveitchik (1903â€“1993), talmudic scholar and
philosopher; Neil Gillman, professor of philosophy at the Jewish Theological
Seminary of America, and Elliot N. Dorff, professor of philosophy at the
American Jewish University. It is believed by some that revelation can
originate directly from a deity, or through an agent, such as an angel. One who
has experienced such contact with or communication from the divine is often
called a prophet. An article (p.Â 555) under the heading "mysticism," and
contributed by Ninian Smart, J.F. Rowny Professor of Comparative Religion,
University of California, and President of the American Academy of Religion,
writing in the 1999 edition of "The Norton Dictionary of Modern Thought," (W.W.
Norton & Co. Inc.), suggests that the more proper and wider term for such an
encounter would be mystical, making such a person a mystic. All prophets would
be mystics, but not all mystics would be prophets. Revelation from a
supernatural source is of lesser importance in some other religious traditions,
such as Taoism and Confucianism. BahÃ¡'Ã­. The BÃ¡b, BahÃ¡'u'llÃ¡h and `Abdu'l-
BahÃ¡ received thousands of written enquiries, and wrote thousands of
responses, hundreds of which amount to whole and proper books, while many are
the shorter texts, as letters. In addition, the BahÃ¡'Ã­ faith has large works
which were divinely revealed in a very short time, as in a night, or a few
days. Additionally, because many of the works were first recorded by an
amanuensis, most were submitted for approval and correction and the final text
was personally approved by the revelator. BahÃ¡'u'llÃ¡h would occasionally
write the words of revelation down himself, but normally the revelation was
dictated to his amanuensis, who sometimes recorded it in what has been called
"revelation writing", a shorthand script written with extreme speed owing to
the rapidity of the utterance of the words. Afterwards, BahÃ¡'u'llÃ¡h revised
and approved these drafts. These "revelation drafts" and many other
transcriptions of the writings of BahÃ¡'u'llÃ¡h's, circa 15,000 items, some of
which are in his own handwriting, are kept in the International BahÃ¡'Ã­
Archives in Haifa, Israel. Christianity. Christianity regards varied
collections of books known as the Bible as authoritative and written by human
authors under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. However, it should be noted
that the mainstream tradition regards "Jesus" as the supreme revelation of God,
with the Bible being a revelation in the sense of a witness to him. The
Catholic Catechism states that "the Christian faith is not a 'religion of the
book.' Christianity is the religion of the 'Word of God', a word which is 'not
a written and mute word, but the Word which is incarnate and living" Some
Christians believe that the Bible is inerrant (in its original form, totally
without error, and free from all contradiction, including the historical and
scientific parts) or infallible (inerrant on issues of faith and practice but
not history or science). In the New Testament, Jesus treats the Old Testament
as authoritative and says it "cannot be broken" (John 10:34â€“36). 2 Timothy 3:
16 says: "All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking,
correction and training in righteousness", and the Second Epistle of Peter
claims that "no prophecy of Scripture â€¦ was ever produced by the will of man,
but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit" (2 Pet 1:
20â€“21). That epistle also claims divine authority for the Apostles (3:2) and
includes Paul's letters as being counted with the Scriptures (3:16), see
Development of the New Testament canon for details. Historians note that the
doctrine of the Bible's infallibility was actually adopted hundreds of years
after those books were written. The first formal confession of the Bible's
inspiration and infallibility as a basis for its authority is in the
Westminster Confession of Faith. The most common versions of the Bible that
Protestant Christians have today consist of 66 books determined mainly by the
Council of Nicaea to be those "authoritative works". This "package" consisting
of the entirety of the 66 books is what most Protestant Christians today
consider to be "the Bible". Roman Catholic Christians, however, recognize 73
books as canonical (46 books of the Old Testament and 27 books of the New
Testament). While none of the 66 books of the Protestant Bible refer
specifically to the set of exactly 66 books as a whole, they do make references
such as the term "all scripture" as used in 2 Timothy 3:16 "All scripture is
given by inspiration of God". In this case, the term "all scripture" is used to
mean all "authoritative works" of the Bible. At the time 2 Timothy was written,
there were more "authoritative works" to come, such as the Book of Revelation
and the Epistles of John. However, the term "all scripture" was used in 2
Timothy in a general way implying "all divinely given, authoritative works of
scripture". The term does not preclude books written subsequent to 2 Timothy
from being included in the definition. Hence, it can be said that the Bible
does refer to itself as a whole in references such as in 2 Timothy. In
addition, since this reference in 2 Timothy refers to "all scripture" as being
"given by inspiration of God", it carries the implication of the whole set of
"authoritative works" as being given by inspiration of God, even though the
identification of exactly what those "authoritative works" were would be a
source of future controversy in the minds of men. Therefore it can be said that
in this sense the Bible does refer to itself as a whole, and it moreover
declares itself to be both authoritative and divinely inspired. In addition,
for the Protestant Christian it may be inferred that the Bible cannot both
refer to itself as being divinely inspired and also be errant or fallible. For
if the Bible were divinely inspired, then the source of inspiration being
divine, would not be subject to fallibility or error in that which is produced.
If the Bible is errant or fallible, it cannot be inspiredfor the God who is
presented in it being infallible and inerrant cannot produce that which is
faulty or in error. To do so would require him to change the essential nature
that inspired Bible attributes to him. Therefore the doctrines of the
infallibility, the inerrancy, and the divine inspiration of the Bible, although
having their particular individual meanings, are inseparably tied together for
the Christian who accepts the inspiration of the Bible. Some Christians hold
that as God possesses all three of these attributes, they draw the conclusion
that the inspired Bible possesses them also, while other Christians would
consider that conclusion to be a form of Bibliolatry. Therefore, although these
doctrines may not have yet been formally stated in the councils and creeds of
the church fathers prior to the First Council of Nicaea in 325, a period
referred to as Early Christianity, they were from the beginning present in the
scriptures of the church that formed the basis of those ecclesial councils and
creeds. Hence the revelation of God to man, as held by Christians to be given
in the Bible, is acknowledged to be inspired, inerrant, and infallible, by
those who hold to those beliefs. Latter Day Saint movement. This denomination
claims that the president of the church receives revelation directly from God
for the direction of the church. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints (or LDS Church) and some other Latter Day Saint denominations claim to
be led by revelation from God to a living prophet, who receives Godâ€™s word,
just as Abraham, Moses, other ancient prophets and apostles did. Latter-day
Saints believe in an open scriptural canon, and in addition to the Bible and
the Book of Mormon, have books of scripture containing the revelations of
modern-day prophets such as the Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl of Great
Price. LDS Church leaders (from the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles) have taught
during the church's General Conferences that conference talks which are "â€¦as
moved upon by the Holy Ghost shall be scriptureâ€¦". In addition, many Mormons
believe that ancient prophets in other regions of the world received
revelations that resulted in additional scriptures that have been lost and may,
one day, be forthcoming. Hence, the belief in continuing revelation. Latter Day
Saints also believe that the United States Constitution is a divinely inspired
document. Each member of the LDS Church is also confirmed a member of the
church following baptism and given the "gift of the Holy Ghost" by which each
member is encouraged to develop a personal relationship with that divine being
and receive personal revelation for their own direction and that of their
family. The Latter Day Saint concept of revelation includes the belief that
revelation from God is available to all those who earnestly seek it with the
intent of doing good. It also teaches that everyone is entitled to "personal"
revelation with respect to his or her stewardship (leadership responsibility).
Thus, parents may receive inspiration from God in raising their families,
individuals can receive divine inspiration to help them meet personal
challenges, church officers may receive revelation for those whom they serve,
and so forth. The important consequence of this is that each person may receive
confirmation that particular doctrines taught by a prophet are true, as well as
gain divine insight in using those truths for their own benefit and eternal
progress. In the church, personal revelation is expected and encouraged, and
many converts believe that personal revelation from God was instrumental in
their conversion. Joseph F. Smith, the sixth president of the LDS Church,
summarized this church's belief concerning revelation by saying, "We believeâ€¦
in the principle of direct revelation from God to man." (Smith, 362) Islam.
Muslims believe that God (Arabic: Ø£Ù„Ù„Ù‡ "Allah") revealed his final message
to humanity through Muhammad via the angel Gabriel. Muhammad is considered to
have been the Seal of the Prophets and Muhammad's revelations, the Qur'an, is
believed by Muslims to be the flawless final revelation of God to humanity,
valid until the Last Day. The Qur'an claims to have been revealed word by word
and letter by letter. Muslims hold that the message of Islam is the same as the
message preached by all the messengers sent by God to humanity since Adam. From
an Islamic point of view, Islam is the oldest of the monotheistic religions
because it represents both the original and the final revelation of God to
Abraham, Moses, David, Jesus, and Muhammad. Likewise, Muslims believe that
every prophet received revelation in their lives, as each prophet was sent by
God to guide mankind. Jesus is significant in this aspect as he received
revelation in a twofold aspect, as Muslims believe he preached the Gospel while
also having been taught the Torah. According to Islamic traditions, Muhammad
began receiving revelations from the age of 40, delivered through the angel
Gabriel over the last 23 years of his life. The content of these revelations,
known as the Qur'an, was memorized and recorded by his followers and compiled
from dozens of hafiz as well as other various parchments or hides into a single
volume shortly after his death. In Muslim theology, Muhammad is considered
equal in importance to all other prophets of God and to make distinction among
the prophets is a sin, as the Qur'an itself promulgates equality between God's
prophets. Many scholars have made the distinction between revelation and
inspiration, which according to Muslim theology, all righteous people can
receive. Inspiration refers to God inspiring a person to commit some action, as
opposed to revelation, which only the prophets received. Moses's mother,
Jochebed, being inspired to send the infant Moses in a cradle down the Nile
river is a frequently cited example of inspiration, as is Hagar searching for
water for the infant Ishmael. Judaism. Rabbinic Judaism, and contemporary
Orthodox Judaism, hold that the Torah (Pentateuch) extant today is essentially
the same one that the whole of the Jewish people received on Mount Sinai, from
God, upon their Exodus from Egypt. Beliefs that God gave a "Torah of truth" to
Moses (and the rest of the people), that Moses was the greatest of the
prophets, and that the Law given to Moses will never be changed, are three of
the Thirteen Principles of Faith of Orthodox Judaism according to Maimonides.
Maimonides explains: "We do not know exactly how the Torah was transmitted to
Moses. But when it was transmitted, "Moses merely wrote it down like a
secretary taking dictation"â€¦(Thus) "every verse in the Torah is equally holy,
as they all originate from God", and are all part of God's Torah, which is
perfect, holy and true." Orthodox Judaism believes that in addition to the
written Torah, God also revealed to Moses a set of oral teachings, called the
Oral Torah. In addition to this revealed law, Jewish law contains decrees and
enactments made by prophets, rabbis, and sages over the course of Jewish
history. Haredi Judaism tends to regard even rabbinic decrees as being of
divine origin or divinely inspired, while Modern Orthodox Judaism tends to
regard them as being more potentially subject to human error, although due to
the Biblical verse "Do not stray from their words" ("Deuteronomy 17:11) it is
still accepted as binding law. Conservative Judaism tends to regard both the
Torah and the Oral law as not verbally revealed. The Conservative approach
tends to regard the Torah as compiled by redactors in a manner similar to the
Documentary Hypothesis. However, Conservative Jews also regard the authors of
the Torah as divinely inspired, and many regard at least portions of it as
originating with Moses. Positions can vary from the position of Joel Roth,
following David Weiss HaLivni, that while the Torah originally given to Moses
on Mount Sinai became corrupted or lost and had to be recompiled later by
redactors, the recompiled Torah is nonetheless regarded as fully Divine and
legally authoritative, to the position of Gordon Tucker that the Torah, while
Divinely inspired, is a largely human document containing significant elements
of human error, and should be regarded as the beginning of an ongoing process
which is continuing today. Conservative Judaism regards the Oral Law as
divinely inspired, but nonetheless subject to human error. Reform and
Reconstructionist Jews also accept the Documentary Hypothesis for the origin of
the Torah, and tend to view all of the Oral law as an entirely human creation.
Accordingly, Progressive Judaism, Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism, believe
that the Torah is not entirely a direct revelation from God, but is a document
written by human ancestors, carrying human understanding and experience, and
seeking to answer the question: 'What does God require of us?'. They believe
that, though it contains many 'core-truths' about God and humanity, it is also
time bound, sexist, primitive, and, sometimes, simply wrong. They believe that
God's will is revealed through the interaction of humanity and God throughout
history, and so, in that sense, Torah is an important part, but only a part, of
an ongoing revelation. Prophets. The Nevi'im, the books of the Prophets, are
considered divine and true. This does not imply that the books of the prophets
are always read literally. Jewish tradition has always held that prophets used
metaphors and analogies. There exists a wide range of commentaries explaining
and elucidating those verses consisting of metaphor. Rabbinic Judaism regards
Moses as the greatest of the prophets, and this view is one of the Thirteen
Principles of Faith of traditional Judaism. Consistent with the view that
revelation to Moses was generally clearer than revelation to other prophets,
Orthodox views of revelation to prophets other than Moses have included a range
of perspectives as to directness. For example, Maimonides in The Guide for the
Perplexed said that accounts of revelation in the Nevi'im were not always as
literal as in the Torah and that some prophetic accounts reflect allegories
rather than literal commands or predictions. Conservative Rabbi and philosopher
Abraham Joshua Heschel (1907â€“1972), author of a number of works on prophecy,
said that, "Prophetic inspiration must be understood "as an event", not as "a
process"." In his work "God in Search of Man", he discussed the experience of
being a prophet. In his book "Prophetic Inspiration After the Prophets:
Maimonides and Others", Heschel references to continued prophetic inspiration
in Jewish Rabbinic Literature following the destruction of the Temple in
Jerusalem and into medieval and even Modern times. He wrote that
