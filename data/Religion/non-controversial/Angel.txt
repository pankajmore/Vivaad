Angel An angel is a supernatural being or spirit found in various religions and
mythologies. In Abrahamic religions they are often depicted as servants of God
and celestial beings who act as intermediaries between heaven and Earth. In
Zoroastrianism and Native American religions angels are depicted as a guiding
influence or a guardian spirit. The English word "angel" is derived from the
Greek "" (angelos), a translation of ("mal'akh") in the Tanakh; a similar term,
("MalƒÅƒ´kah"), is used in the Qur'an. The Hebrew and Greek words in ancient
times meant "messenger", and depending on the context may refer either to a
"human messenger" or a "supernatural messenger". The "human messenger" could
possibly be a prophet or priest, such as Malachi, "my messenger", and the Greek
superscription that the Book of Malachi was written "by the hand of his
messenger" "·ºÄŒ≥Œ≥ŒÆŒªŒøœÖ". Examples of a "supernatural messenger", are the
"Mal'akh YHWH," who is either a messenger from God, an aspect of God (such as
the Logos), or God Himself as the messenger (the "theophanic angel.") The term
"angel" has also been expanded to various notions of spirits found in many
other religious traditions. Other roles of angels include protecting and
guiding human beings, and carrying out God's tasks. The theological study of
angels is known as "angelology". In art, angels are often depicted with wings
on their back, a halo, robes and various forms of glowing light. Etymology. The
word "angel" in English is a fusion of the Old English word "engel" (with a
hard g) and the Old French "angele". Both derive from the Latin "angelus" which
in turn is the romanization of the ancient Greek "" ("angelos"), "messenger",
which is related to the Greek verb "" ("angell≈ç"), meaning "bear a message,
announce, bring news of" etc. The earliest form of the word is the Mycenaean
"a-ke-ro" attested in Linear B syllabic script. Judaism. The Bible uses the
terms ◊û◊ú◊ê◊ö ◊ê◊ú◊î◊ô◊ù ("mal'akh Elohim"; messenger of God), ◊û◊ú◊ê◊ö
◊ô◊î◊ï◊î ("mal'akh YHWH"; messenger of the Lord), ◊ë◊ ◊ô ◊ê◊ú◊î◊ô◊ù ("b'nai
Elohim"; sons of God) and ◊î◊ß◊ï◊ì◊©◊ô◊ù ("ha-qodeshim"; the holy ones) to
refer to beings traditionally interpreted as angels. Later texts use other
terms, such as ◊î◊¢◊ú◊ô◊ï◊ ◊ô◊ù ("ha'elyoneem"; the upper ones). Scholar
Michael D. Coogan notes that it is only in the late books that the terms "come
to mean the benevolent semidivine beings familiar from later mythology and
art." Daniel is the first biblical figure to refer to individual angels by
name, mentioning Gabriel (God's primary messenger) in Daniel 9:21 and Michael
(the holy fighter) in Daniel 10:13. These angels are part of Daniel's
apocalyptic visions and are an important part of all apocalyptic literature.
Coogan explains the development of this concept of angels: "In the postexilic
period, with the development of explicit monotheism, these divine beings‚Äîthe
'sons of God' who were members of the Divine Council‚Äî were in effect demoted
to what are now known as 'angels', understood as beings created by God, but
immortal and thus superior to humans." This conception of angels is best
understood in contrast to demons and is often thought to be "influenced by the
ancient Persian religious tradition of Zoroastrianism, which viewed the world
as a battleground between forces of good and forces of evil, between light and
darkness." One of these "sons of God" is "the satan", a figure depicted in
(among other places) the Book of Job. Philo of Alexandria identifies the angel
with the Logos as far as the angel is the immaterial voice of God. The angel is
something different than God Himself, but is conceived just as a God's
instrument. In post-Biblical Judaism, certain angels took on particular
significance and developed unique personalities and roles. Though these
archangels were believed to rank among the heavenly host, no systematic
hierarchy ever developed. Metatron is considered one of the highest of the
angels in Merkabah and Kabbalist mysticism and often serves as a scribe; he is
briefly mentioned in the Talmud and figures prominently in Merkabah mystical
texts. Michael, who serves as a warrior and advocate for Israel (), is looked
upon particularly fondly. Gabriel is mentioned in the Book of Daniel (), the
Book of Tobit, and briefly in the Talmud, as well as in many Merkabah mystical
texts. There is no evidence in Judaism for the worship of angels, but there is
evidence for the invocation and sometimes even conjuration of angels. According
to Kabalah, there are four worlds and our world is the last world: the world of
action (Assiyah). Angels exist in the worlds above as a 'task' of God. They are
an extension of God to produce effects in this world. After an angel has
completed its task, it ceases to exist. The angel is in effect the task. This
is derived from the book of Genesis when Abraham meets with three angels and
Lot meets with two. The task of one of the angels was to inform Abraham of his
coming child. The other two were to save Lot and to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah.
Christianity. Early Christians inherited Jewish understandings of angels, which
in turn may have been partly inherited from the Egyptians. By the late fourth
century, the Church Fathers agreed that there were different categories of
angels, with appropriate missions and activities assigned to them. There was,
however, some disagreement regarding the nature of angels. Some argued that
Angels had physical bodies, while some maintained that they were entirely
spiritual. Some theologians had proposed that Jesus was not divine but on the
level of immaterial beings subordinate to the Trinity. The resolution of this
Trinitarian dispute included the development of doctrine about angels. The
angels are represented throughout the Christian Bible as a body of spiritual
beings intermediate between God and men: "You have made him (man) a little less
than the angels..." (). Some Christians believe that angels are created beings,
and use the following passage as evidence: "praise ye Him, all His angels:
praise ye Him, all His hosts... for He spoke and they were made. He commanded
and they were created..." (; ). The Fourth Lateran Council (1215) declared that
the angels were created beings. The Council's decree "Firmiter credimus"
(issued against the Albigenses) declared both that angels were created and that
men were created after them. The First Vatican Council (1869) repeated this
declaration in "Dei Filius", the "Dogmatic constitution on the Catholic faith".
Of note is that the Bible describes the function of angels as "messengers" and
does not indicate when the creation of angels occurred. Thomas Aquinas (13th
century) relates angels to Aristotle's metaphysics in his "Summa contra
Gentiles", "Summa Theologica", and in "De substantiis separatis", a treatise on
angelology. Many Christians regard angels as asexual and not belonging to
either gender as they interpret Matthew 22:30 in this way. Angels are on the
other hand usually described as looking like male human beings. Their names are
also masculine. And although angels have greater knowledge than men, they are
not omniscient, as Matthew 24:36 points out. Christian art perhaps reflects the
descriptions in Revelation 4:6‚Äì8 of the Four Living Creatures () and the
descriptions in the Hebrew Bible of cherubim and seraphim (the chayot in
Ezekiel's Merkabah vision and the Seraphim of Isaiah). However, while cherubim
and seraphim have wings in the Bible, no angel is mentioned as having wings.
Interaction with angels. The New Testament includes many interactions and
conversations between angels and humans. For instance, three separate cases of
angelic interaction deal with the births of John the Baptist and Jesus Christ.
In Luke 1:11, an angel appears to Zechariah to inform him that he will have a
child despite his old age, thus proclaiming the birth of John the Baptist And
in Luke 1:26 the archangel Gabriel visits the Virgin Mary in the Annunciation
to foretell the birth of Jesus Christ. Angels then proclaim the birth of Jesus
in the Adoration of the shepherds in Luke 2:10. Angels also appear later in the
New Testament. In Luke 22:43 an angel comforts Jesus Christ during the Agony in
the Garden. In Matthew 28:5 an angel speaks at the empty tomb, following the
Resurrection of Jesus and the rolling back of the stone by angels. Hebrews 13:
2 reminds the reader that they may "entertain angels unaware". Since the
completion of the New Testament, the Christian tradition has continued to
include a number of reported interactions with angels. For instance, in 1851
Pope Pius IX approved the Chaplet of Saint Michael based on the 1751 private
revelation from archangel Michael to the Carmelite nun Antonia d'Astonac. And
Pope John Paul II emphasized the role of angels in Catholic teachings in his
1986 address titled ""Angels Participate In History Of Salvation"", in which he
suggested that modern mentality should come to see the importance of angels. As
recently as the 20th century, visionaries and mystics have reported
interactions with, and indeed dictations from, angels. For instance, the bed-
ridden Italian writer and mystic Maria Valtorta wrote "The Book of Azariah"
based on "dictations" that she directly attributed to her guardian angel
Azariah, discussing the Roman Missal used for Sunday Mass in 1946 and 1947.
Iconography. The earliest known Christian image of an angel‚Äîin the "Cubicolo
dell'Annunziazione" in the Catacomb of Priscilla (mid-third century)‚Äîis
without wings. In that same period, representations of angels on sarcophagi,
lamps and reliquaries also show them without wings, as for example the angel in
the "Sacrifice of Isaac" scene in the Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus (although
the side view of the Sarcophagus shows winged angelic figures). The earliest
known representation of angels with wings is on the "Prince's Sarcophagus",
discovered in the 1930s at Sarig√ºzel, near Istanbul, and attributed to the
time of Theodosius I (379‚Äì395). From that period on, Christian art has
represented angels mostly with wings, as in the cycle of mosaics in the
Basilica of Saint Mary Major (432‚Äì440). Four- and six-winged angels, drawn
from the higher grades of angels (especially cherubim and seraphim) and often
showing only their faces and wings, are derived from Persian art and are
usually shown only in heavenly contexts, as opposed to performing tasks on
earth. They often appear in the pendentives of church domes or semi-domes.
Prior of the Judeo-Christian tradition in the Greek world, the Greek goddess
Nike and the god Eros were also depicted in human-like form with wings. Saint
John Chrysostom explained the significance of angels' wings: In terms of their
clothing, angels, especially the Archangel Michael, were depicted as military-
style agents of God and came to be shown wearing Late Antique military uniform.
This uniform could be the normal military dress, with a tunic to about the
knees, an armour breastplate and "pteruges", but was often the specific dress
of the bodyguard of the Byzantine Emperor, with a long tunic and the "loros",
the long gold and jewelled "pallium" restricted to the Imperial family and
their closest guards. The basic military dress was shown in Western art into
the Baroque period and beyond (see Reni picture above), and up to the present
day in Eastern Orthodox icons. Other angels came to be conventionally depicted
in long robes, and in the later Middle Ages they often wear the vestments of a
deacon, a cope over a dalmatic; this costume was used especially for Gabriel in
Annunciation scenes‚Äîfor example the Annunciation in Washington by Jan van
Eyck. Latter Day Saints. Adherents of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints (generally referred to as "Mormons") view angels as the messengers of
God. They are sent to mankind to deliver messages, minister to humanity, teach
doctrines of salvation, call mankind to repentance, give priesthood keys, save
individuals in perilous times, and guide humankind. ^ Deseret (1966) p.36.
Latter Day Saints believe that angels either are the spirits of humans who are
deceased or who have yet to be born, or are humans who have been resurrected or
translated and have physical bodies of flesh and bones, and accordingly Joseph
Smith taught that "there are no angels who minister to this earth but those
that do belong or have belonged to it." As such, Latter Day Saints also believe
that Adam (the first man) is now the archangel Michael, and that Gabriel lived
on the earth as Noah. Likewise the Angel Moroni first lived in a pre-Columbian
American civilization as the 5th-century prophet-warrior named Moroni. Most
angelic visitations in the early Latter Day Saint movement were witnessed by
Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, who both claimed (prior to the establishment
of the Church in 1830) to have been visited by the prophet Moroni, John the
Baptist, and the Apostles Peter, James, and John. Later, at the dedication of
the Kirtland Temple, Smith and Sidney Rigdon claimed to have been visited by
Jesus, and subsequently by Moses, Elias, and Elijah. Angels are typically
depicted in Mormon art as having no wings based on a quote from Joseph Smith
("An angel of God never has wings"). People who claimed to have received a
visit by an angel include the other two of the Three Witnesses: David Whitmer
and Martin Harris. Many other Latter Day Saints, both in the early and modern
church, have claimed to have seen angels, though Smith posited that, except in
extenuating circumstances such as the restoration, mortals teach mortals,
spirits teach spirits and resurrected beings teach other resurrected beings.
Islam. Angels (Arabic: ŸÖŸÑÿßÿ¶ŸÉÿ© , "MalƒÅ æikah"; Turkish: "Melek") are
mentioned many times in the Qur'an and Hadith. Islam is clear on the nature of
angels in that they are messengers of God. They have no free will, and can do
only what God orders them to do. An example of a task they carry out is that of
testing individuals by granting them abundant wealth and curing their illness.
Believing in angels is one of the six Articles of Faith in Islam. Bah√°'√≠
Faith. In his "Book of Certitude" Bah√°‚Äôu‚Äôll√°h, founder of the Bah√°‚Äô√≠
Faith, describes angels as people who "have consumed, with the fire of the love
of God, all human traits and limitations", and have "clothed themselves" with
angelic attributes and have become "endowed with the attributes of the
spiritual". 'Abdu‚Äôl-Bah√° describes angels as the "confirmations of God and
His celestial powers" and as "blessed beings who have severed all ties with
this nether world" and "been released from the chains of self", and "revealers
of God‚Äôs abounding grace". The Bah√°‚Äô√≠ writings also refer to the
Concourse on High, an angelic host, and the Maid of Heaven of
Bah√°‚Äôu‚Äôll√°h's vision. Non-Abrahamic traditions. "Angel" is sometimes used
as a translation of related concepts in non-Abrahamic traditions. Neoplatonism.
In the commentaries of Proclus (4th C, under Christian rule) on the Timaeus of
Plato, Proclus uses the terminology of "angelic" ("aggelikos") and "angel"
("aggelos") in relation to metaphysical beings. According to Aristotle, just as
there is a First Mover, so, too, must there be spiritual secondary movers.
Zoroastrianism. In Zoroastrianism there are different angel-like figures. For
example, each person has one guardian angel, called Fravashi. They patronize
human beings and other creatures, and also manifest God‚Äôs energy. The Amesha
Spentas have often been regarded as angels, although there is no direct
reference to them conveying messages, but are rather emanations of Ahura Mazda
("Wise Lord", God); they initially appear in an abstract fashion and then later
became personalized, associated with diverse aspects of the divine creation.
Sikhism. In Sikhism, the references to angelic or divine deities is often
objected as the religion focuses on the liberation of the soul and ultimately
joining with Waheguru. However, in early scriptures written by Guru Nanak Dev
Ji indicate specific heavenly deities to help in the judgment of the soul.
Azrael (as Azraa-eel) is named as the angel of death in the Guru Granth Sahib,
the holy scripture and the final Guru of the Sikhs. In So Dar and Raag Asa Sat
Guru Nanak mentions clearly two beings Chitar and Gupat who record the deeds of
men. These beings are Angels assigned with this Divine task by the Creator.
Chitar records the deeds that are visible to all and Gupat records that which
is hidden in thought or secret action. Their names themselves allude to the
tasks which the All Mighty has bestowed upon them. The celestial beings are
often seen at the gates of heaven, dressed in the most adorned and decorated
gowns, holding the records on the actions and feelings of the soul in the line
for judgment. Brahma Kumaris. In Brahma Kumaris, it is taught that every member
becomes an angel of light (farishta in Hindi) and that founder Dada Lekhraj has
already become perfect man and angel Brahma through practise of Raja Yoga. New
religious movements and occultism. Theosophy. In the teachings of Theosophy,
"Devas" are regarded as living either in the atmospheres of the planets of the
solar system ("Planetary Angels") or inside the Sun ("Solar Angels")
(presumably other planetary systems and stars have their own angels) and they
help to guide the operation of the processes of nature such as the process of
evolution and the growth of plants; their appearance is reputedly like colored
flames about the size of a human. It is believed by Theosophists that devas can
be observed when the third eye is activated. Some (but not most) devas
originally incarnated as human beings. It is believed by Theosophists that
nature spirits, elementals (gnomes, undines, sylphs, and salamanders), and
fairies can be also be observed when the third eye is activated. It is
maintained by Theosophists that these less evolutionarily developed beings have
never been previously incarnated as humans; they are regarded as being on a
separate line of spiritual evolution called the ‚Äúdeva evolution‚Äù;
eventually, as their souls advance as they reincarnate, it is believed they
will incarnate as devas. It is asserted by Theosophists that all of the above
mentioned beings possess etheric bodies that are composed of "etheric matter",
a type of matter finer and more pure that is composed of smaller particles than
ordinary physical plane matter. Contemporary belief in angels. A 2002 study
based on interviews with 350 people, mainly in the UK, who said they have had
an experience of an angel, describes several types of such experiences:
visions, sometimes with multiple witnesses present; auditions, e.g. to convey a
warning; a sense of being touched, pushed, or lifted, typically to avert a
dangerous situation; and pleasant fragrance, generally in the context of
somebody's death. In the visual experiences, the angels described appear in
various forms, either the "classical" one (human countenance with wings), in
the form of extraordinarily beautiful or radiant human beings, or as beings of
light. In the US, a 2008 survey by Baylor University's Institute for Studies of
Religion, published by "TIME" magazine, which polled 1,700 respondents, found
that 55 percent of Americans, including one in five of those who say they are
not religious, believe that they have been protected by a guardian angel during
their life. An August 2007 Pew poll found that 68 percent of Americans believe
that "angels and demons are active in the world", and according to four
different polls conducted in 2009, a greater percentage of Americans believe in
angels (55%) than those who believe in global warming (36%). In 2009 a
biologist from University College London published a paper exploring the
physiology of angels based on representations in artwork, concluding that they
would be unable to fly. According to the Gallup Youth Survey, in a "Teen Belief
in the Supernatural" poll in 1994, 76% of 508 teenagers (aged 13‚Äì17) believe
in angels, a greater percentage than those who believe in astrology, ESP,
ghosts, witchcraft, clairvoyance, Bigfoot, and vampires. In 1978, 64% of
American young people believed in angels; in 1984, 69% of teenagers believed in
angels; and by 1994, that number grew to 76%, while belief in other
supernatural concepts, such as the Loch Ness monster and ESP, have declined. In
1992, 80% of 502 surveyed teenage girls believe in angels, and 81% of Catholic
teens and 82% of regular church attendees harbored beliefs in angels. According
to another set of Gallup polls, designated towards all Americans, in 1994, 72%
of Americans said they believed in angels, while in 2004, 78% of the surveyed
Americans indicated belief in angels, with the percentage of Americans that did
not believe in angels dropping from 15% to 10%, and the percentage of Americans
that were "not sure" dropping from 13% to 11%. A 2008 survey of over 1000
Canadians found 67 percent believe in angels.
