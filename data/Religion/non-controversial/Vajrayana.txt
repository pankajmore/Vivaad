MantrayƒÅna, Secret Mantra, Esoteric Buddhism and the Diamond Vehicle.
Vajrayana is a complex and multifaceted system of Buddhist thought and practice
which evolved over several centuries. According to Vajrayana scriptures
Vajrayana refers to one of three vehicles or routes to enlightenment, the other
two being the Theravada and Mahayana. Its main scriptures are called Tantras. A
distinctive feature of Vajrayana Buddhism is its use of rituals known as Upaya
(or Skillful Means), which are used as a substitute or alternative for abstract
meditations. History of Vajrayana. Although the first tantric Buddhist texts
appeared in India in the 3rd century and continued to appear until the 12th
century, scholars such as Hirakawa Akira assert that the Vajrayana probably
came into existence in the 6th or 7th century, while the term Vajrayana itself
first appeared in the 8th century. The Vajrayana was preceded by the
Mantrayana, and then followed by the Sahajayana and Kalachakrayana. India. The
period of Indian Vajrayana Buddhism has been classified as the fifth or final
period of Indian Buddhism. The literature of Vajrayana is absent from the
oldest Buddhist literature of the Pali Canon and the Agamas. Mythological
origins. In the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, it is claimed that the historical
Shakyamuni Buddha taught tantra, but that since these are 'secret' teachings,
confined to the guru/disciple relationship, they were generally written down
long after the Buddha's other teachings, the Pali Canon and the Mahayana
sutras. The Vajrayana tradition holds that its teachings were first expounded
by the Buddha sixteen years after his enlightenment. Historians have identified
an early stage of Mantrayana beginning in the 4th century, and argue that
assigning the teachings to the historical Buddha is "patently absurd."
According to some traditions, Tantric Buddhism first developed in Uddiyana, a
country which was divided into the two kingdoms Samba·∏∑a and Lankapuri.
Samba·∏∑a has been identified with Sambalpur and Lankapuri with Subarnapura
(Sonepur). Indrabhuti, the king of Sambalpur founded Vajrayana, while his
sister, who was married to Prince (Yuvaraja) Jalendra of Lankapuri (Sonepur),
founded Sahajayana. Historical origins. Mantrayana and Vajrayana. Although the
Vajrayana claims to be as ancient and authentic as any other Buddhist school,
it may have grown up gradually in an environment with previously existing texts
such as the "mahasannipata" and the "ratnaketudharani". The basic position of
Vajrayana is still the same as the early Buddhist position of not-self: there
is nothing which is eternal. The changes that took place reflected the changing
society of medieval India: the presentation changed, the techniques of the way
to enlightenment changed, and the outward appearance of Buddhism came to be
dominated by ritualism, and the array of Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, and gods and
goddesses. There are differing views as to where in the Indian sub-continent
that Vajrayana began. There are assumptions about the origin of Vajrayana in
Bengal, Uddiyana, located at Orissa, or in the modern day Swat Valley in
Pakistan. The earliest texts appeared around the early 4th century. Nalanda
University in eastern India became a center for the development of Vajrayana
theory, although it is likely that the university followed, rather than led,
the early Tantric movement. Only from the 7th or the beginning of the 8th
century, tantric techniques and approaches increasingly dominated Buddhist
practice in India. From the 7th century onwards many popular religious elements
of a heterogeneous nature were incorporated into Mahayana Buddhism, which
finally resulted in the appearance of Vajrayana, Kalachakrayana, and Sahajayana
Tantric Buddhism. These new Tantric cults of Buddhism introduced Mantra, Mudra
and Mandala, along with six tantric Abhicharas (practices) such as Marana
(Death), Stambhana, Sammohana, Vidvesan, Uchchatana and Vajikarana. These cults
revived primitive beliefs and practices, a simpler and less formal approach to
the personal god, a liberal and respectful attitude towards women, and denial
of the caste system. India would continue as the source of leading-edge
Vajrayana practices up until the 11th century, producing many renowned
Mahasiddha. (Vajrayana) Buddhism had mostly died out in India by the 13th
century, and tantric versions of Buddhism and Hinduism were also experiencing
pressure from invading Islamic armies. By that time, the vast majority of the
practices were also manifest in Tibet, where they were preserved until
recently. In the second half of the 20th century a sizable number of Tibetan
exiles fled the oppressive, anti-religious rule of the Communist Chinese to
establish Tibetan Buddhist communities in northern India, particularly around
Dharamsala. Sahajayana and Kalachakrayana. The Vajrayana established the
symbolic terminology and the liturgy that would characterize all forms of the
tradition. The Sahajayana developed in the eight century in Bengal. It was
dominated by long-haired, wandering siddhas who openly challenged and ridiculed
the Buddhist establishment. Its most important text is the "Dohakosa", written
by Sarahapada. The Kalachakrayana developed in the 10th century. It is farthest
removed from the earlier Buddhist traditions, and incorporates concepts of
messianism and astrology not present elsewhere in Buddhist literature. Despised
classes. The Tantric Buddhist sects made efforts to raise the dignity of the
lowest of the low of the society to a higher level. Many celebrated Vajrayana
Acharyas like Saraha, Hadipa, Dombi, Heruka, Tantipa (TantripƒÅda) and LuipƒÅda
came from the so-called despised classes. The cult exerted a tremendous
influence over the tribal and despised classes of people of Sambalpur and
Bolangir region. It was in the 9th-10th century that there appeared seven
famous Tantric maidens in the Patna (Patnagarh) region, which was then called
KuƒÅnri-PƒÅta·πáƒÅ. These maidens are popularly known as SƒÅta Bhauni (Seven
sisters), namely, Gyanadei Maluni, Luhakuti, Luhuru·πái, Nitei Dhobani, Sukuti
Chamaru·πái, Patrapindhi Sabaru·πái, Gangi Gaudu·πái and sua Telu·πái. They
hailed from the castes which were considered the lower castes of society, and
were followers of Lakshminkara. Because of their miraculous power and feats,
they were later deified and worshiped by the locals. China. Esoteric teachings
followed the same route into northern China as Buddhism itself, arriving via
the Silk Road sometime during the first half of the 7th century, during the
Tang Dynasty. Esoteric Mantrayana practices arrived from India just as Buddhism
was reaching its zenith in China, and received sanction from the emperors of
the Tang Dynasty. During this time, three great masters came from India to
China: ≈öubhakarasi·πÉha, Vajrabodhi, and Amoghavajra. These three masters
brought the esoteric teachings to their height of popularity in China. During
this era, the two main source texts were the ', and the '. Traditions in the
Sinosphere still exist for these teachings, and they more or less share the
same doctrines as Shingon, with many of its students themselves traveling to
Japan to be given transmission at Mount Koya. Esoteric methods were naturally
incorporated into Chinese Buddhism during the Tang Dynasty. ≈öubhakarasi·πÉha's
most eminent disciple, Master Yixing (Ch. ‰∏ÄË°å), was a member of the Zen
school. In such a way, in Chinese Buddhism there was no major distinction
between exoteric and esoteric practices, and the northern school of Zen
Buddhism even became known for its esoteric practices of dhƒÅra·πáƒ´s and
mantras. During the Yuan Dynasty, the Mongol emperors made Esoteric Buddhism
the official religion of China, and Tibetan lamas were given patronage at the
court. A common perception was that this patronage of lamas caused corrupt
forms of tantra to become widespread. When the Mongol Yuan Dynasty was
overthrown and the Ming Dynasty was established, the Tibetan lamas were
expelled from the court, and this form of Buddhism was denounced as not being
an orthodox path. In late imperial China, the early traditions of Esoteric
Buddhism were still thriving in Buddhist communities. Robert Gimello has also
observed that in these communities, the esoteric practices associated with
Cundƒ´ were extremely popular among both the populace and the elite. Tibet and
other Himalayan kingdoms. In 747 the Indian master Padmasambhava traveled from
Afghanistan to bring Vajrayana Buddhism to Tibet and Bhutan, at the request of
the king of Tibet. This was the original transmission which anchors the lineage
of the Nyingma school. During the 11th century and early 12th century a second
important transmission occurred with the lineages of Atisa, Marpa and Brogmi,
giving rise to the other schools of Tibetan Buddhism, namely Kadam, Kagyu,
Sakya, and Geluk (the school of the Dalai Lama). Japan. During the Tang Dynasty
in China, when esoteric Buddhist practices reached their peak, Japan was
actively importing Buddhism, its texts and teachings, by sending monks on risky
missions across the sea to stay in China for two years or more. Depending on
where the monk stayed and trained, they may have brought back esoteric Buddhist
material and training back to Japan. In 804, monk Saicho came back from China
with teachings from the Tiantai sect, but was also trained in esoteric
lineages. When he later founded the Japanese Tendai sect, esoteric practices
were integrated with the Tendai teachings, but Tendai is not an exclusively
esoteric sect. Subsequent disciples of Saicho also returned from China in later
years with further esoteric training, which helped to flesh out the lineage in
Japan. On the same mission in 804, Emperor Kammu also sent monk K≈´kai to the
Tang Dynasty capital at Chang'an (present-day Xi'an). K≈´kai absorbed the
Vajrayana thinking from eminent Indian and Chinese Vajrayana teachers at the
time, and synthesized a version of which he took back with him to Japan, where
he founded the Shingon school of Buddhism, a school which continues to this
day. Unlike Tendai, Shingon is a purely esoteric sect. Indonesian Archipelago.
The empire of Srivijaya in southeast Sumatra was already a center of Vajrayana
learning when Dharma Master Yijing (Ch. Ê≥ïÂ∏´Áæ©Ê∑®) resided there for six
months in 671, long before Padmasambhava brought the method to Tibet. In the
11th century, Atisha studied in Srivijaya under Serlingpa, an eminent Buddhist
scholar and a prince of the Srivijayan ruling house. Through early economic
relationships with the Srivijaya Empire, the Philippines came under the
influence of Vajrayana. Vajrayana Buddhism also influenced the construction of
Borobudur, a three-dimensional mandala, in central Java circa 800. Mongolia. In
the 13th century, the Tibetan Buddhist teachers of the Sakya school led by
Sakya Pandita Kunga Gyaltsen, took part in a religious debate with Christians
and Muslims before the Mongolian royal court. As a result the Mongolian Prince
Godan adopted Tibetan Buddhism as his personal religion, although not requiring
it of his subjects. Drog√∂n Ch√∂gyal Phagpa, Sakya Pandita's nephew, eventually
converted Kublai Khan to Buddhism. Since the Khan conquered China and
established the Yuan Dynasty which lasted from 1271 to 1368, this led to the
renewal in China of the Tantric practices which had died out there many years
earlier. Vajrayana practice declined in China and Mongolia with the fall of the
Yuan Dynasty. Mongolia saw another revival of Vajrayana in the 17th century,
with the establishment of ties between the Dalai Lama in Tibet and the
Mongolian princedoms. This revived the historic pattern of the spiritual
leaders of Tibet acting as priests to the rulers of the Mongol empire. Having
survived suppression by the Communists, Buddhism in Mongolia is today primarily
of the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism, and is being re-invigorated following
the fall of the Communist government. Place within Buddhist tradition. Various
classifications are possible when distinguishing Vajrayana from the other
Buddhist traditions. Sutrayana and Vajrayana. Vajrayana can be distinguished
from the Sutrayana. The "Sutrayana" is the method of perfecting good qualities,
where the "VajrayƒÅna" is the method of taking the intended outcome of
Buddhahood as the path. Paramitayana and Vajrayana. According to this schema,
Indian Mahayana revealed two vehicles ("yana") or methods for attaining
enlightenment: the method of the perfections ("Paramitayana") and the method of
mantra ("Mantrayana"). The "Paramitayana" consists of the six or ten
"paramitas", of which the scriptures say that it takes three incalculable aeons
to lead one to Buddhahood. The tantra literature, however, claims that the
"Mantrayana" leads one to Buddhahood in a single lifetime. According to the
literature, the mantra is an easy path without the difficulties innate to the
"Paramitanaya". "Mantrayana" is sometimes portrayed as a method for those of
inferior abilities. However the practitioner of the mantra still has to adhere
to the vows of the Bodhisattva. Philosophical background. Vajrayana is firmly
grounded in Mahayana-philosophy, especially Madhyamaka. Two Truths Doctrine.
Vajrayana subscribes to the two truths doctrine of conventional and ultimate
truths, which is present in all Buddhist tenet systems. The two truths doctrine
is a central concept in the Vajrayana path of practice and is the philosophical
basis for its methods. The two truths identifies conventional a.k.a. relative,
and absolute a.k.a. nirvana. Conventional truth is the truth of consensus
reality, common-sense notions of what does and does not exist. Ultimate truth
is reality as viewed by an awakened, or enlightened mind. Characteristics of
Vajrayana. Goal. The goal of spiritual practice within the Mahayana and
Vajrayana traditions is to become a Bodhisattva (i.e. attainment of a state in
which one will subsequently become a Buddha--after some further reincarnation),
whereas the goal for Theravada practice is specific to become an arahant (i.e.
attain enlightenment with no intention of returning, not even as a Buddha). In
the Sutrayana practice, a path of Mahayana, the "path of the cause" is taken,
whereby a practitioner starts with his or her potential Buddha-nature and
nurtures it to produce the fruit of Buddhahood. In the Vajrayana the "path of
the fruit" is taken whereby the practitioner takes his or her innate Buddha-
nature as the means of practice. The premise is that since we innately have an
enlightened mind, practicing seeing the world in terms of ultimate truth can
help us to attain our full Buddha-nature. Experiencing ultimate truth is said
to be the purpose of all the various tantric techniques practiced in the
Vajrayana. Apart from the advanced meditation practices such as Mahamudra and
Dzogchen, which aim to experience the empty nature of the enlightened mind that
can see ultimate truth, all practices are aimed in some way at purifying the
impure perception of the practitioner to allow ultimate truth to be seen. These
may be "ngondro", or preliminary practices, or the more advanced techniques of
the tantric "sadhana". Motivation. As with the Mahayana, motivation is a vital
component of Vajrayana practice. The Bodhisattva-path is an integral part of
the Vajrayana, which teaches that all practices are to be undertaken with the
motivation to achieve Buddhahood for the benefit of all sentient beings.
Ritual. The distinctive feature of Vajrayana Buddhism is ritual, which is used
as a substitute or alternative for the earlier abstract meditations. For
Vajrayana Tibetan death rituals, see "phowa". Upaya. The Vajrayana is based on
the concept of "skilful means" (Sanskrit: "upaya") as formulated in Mahayana
Buddhism. It is a system of lineages, whereby those who successfully receive an
Empowerment (Tibetan Buddhism) or sometimes called initiation (permission to
practice) are seen to share in the mindstream of the realisation of a
particular skillful means of the "vajra" Master. In the Vajrayana these skilful
means mainly relate to tantric, Mahamudra or Dzogchen practices. Vajrayana
teaches that the Vajrayana techniques provide an accelerated path to
enlightenment. Esoteric transmission. The teachings may also be considered
"self-secret", meaning that even if they were to be told directly to a person,
that person would not necessarily understand the teachings without proper
context. In this way the teachings are "secret" to the minds of those who are
not following the path with more than a simple sense of curiosity. The esoteric
transmission framework can take varying forms. The Nyingma school of Tibetan
Buddhism uses a method called Dzogchen. The Tibetan Kagyu school and the
Shingon school in Japan use an alternative method called Mahamudra. Vows and
behaviour. Practitioners of the Vajrayana need to abide by various tantric vows
or "samaya" of behaviour. These are extensions of the rules of the Pratimoksha
vows and Bodhisattva vows for the lower levels of tantra, and are taken during
initiations into the empowerment for a particular Anuttarayoga tantra. The
special tantric vows vary depending on the specific mandala practice for which
the initiation is received, and also depending on the level of initiation. The
Ngagpa/Ngakmo Yogis from the Nyingma school keep a special non-celibate
ordination, they are practitioners and are considered neither lay nor monk or
nun. Tantra techniques. Classifications of tantra. The various Tantra-texts can
be classified in various ways. Outer and Inner Tantras. A different division is
used by the Nyingma or Ancient Translation school. Kriyayoga, Charyayoga and
Yogatantra are called the Outer Tantras, while Anuttarayogatantra is divided
into Three Inner Tantras, which correspond to the Annuttara-yoga tantras. In
the highest class of tantra, two stages of practice are distinguished. Details
of these practices are normally only explained to practitioners by their
teachers after receiving an initiation or 'permission to practice'. In some
Buddhist tantras, both stages can be practiced simultaneously, whereas in
others, one first actualizes the generation stage before continuing with the
completion stage practices. Generation stage. In the first stage of generation,
one engages in deity yoga. One practices oneself in the identification with the
meditational Buddha or deity ("yidam") by visualisations, until one can
meditate single-pointedly on 'being' the deity. Completion stage. In the next
stage of completion, the practitioner can use either the "path of method (thabs
lam)" or the "path of liberation ('grol lam)". At the path of method the
practitioner engages in Kundalini yoga practices. These involve the subtle
energy system of the body of the chakras and the energy channels. The "wind
energy" is directed and dissolved into the heart chakra, where-after the
Mahamudra remains, and the practitioner is physically and mentally transformed.
At the path of liberation the practitioner applies mindfulness, a preparatory
practice for Mahamudra or Dzogchen, to realize the inherent emptiness of every-
'thing' that exists. Deity yoga. Deity yoga (Tibetan: "lha'i rnal 'byor";
Sanskrit: "Devata") is the fundamental Vajrayana practice. It is a "sadhana" in
which practitioners visualize themselves as a deity or "yidam". Deity Yoga
brings the meditator to the experience of being one with the deity: By
visualizing oneself and one's environment entirely as a projection of mind, it
helps the practitioner to become familiar with the mind's ability and habit of
projecting conceptual layers over all experience. This experience undermines a
habitual belief that views of reality and self are solid and fixed. Deity yoga
enables the practitioner to release, or 'purify' him or herself from spiritual
obscurations (Sanskrit: "klesha") and to practice compassion and wisdom
simultaneously. Recent studies indicate that Deity yoga yields quantifiable
improvements in the practitioner's ability to process visuospatial information,
specifically those involved in working visuospatial memory. Guru yoga. Guru
yoga (or teacher practice) (Tibetan: "bla ma'i rnal 'byor") is a tantric
devotional process whereby the practitioners unite their mindstream with the
mindstream of the guru. The guru is engaged as "yidam", as a "nirmanakaya"
manifestation of a Buddha. The process of guru yoga might entail visualization
of an entire lineage of masters (refuge tree) as an invocation of the lineage.
It usually involves visualization of the guru above or in front of the
practitioner. Guru yoga may entail a liturgy or mantra such as the "Prayer in
Seven Lines." (Tibetan: "tshig bdun gsol 'debs") The Guru or spiritual teacher
is essential as a guide during tantric practice, as without their example,
blessings and grace, genuine progress is held to be impossible for all but the
most keen and gifted. Many tantric texts qualify the Three Jewels of Buddha,
Dharma and Sangha thus: "The Guru is Buddha, the Guru is Dharma, the Guru is
also Sangha" to reflect their importance for the disciple. The guru is
considered even more compassionate and more potent than the Buddha because we
can have a direct relationship with the guru. The guru therefore appears with
the "yidam" and "dakini" in the Three Roots refuge formulation of the three
factors essential for tantric attainments. Death yoga. According to the
Vajrayana tradition, at certain times the bodymind is in a very subtle state
which can be used by advanced practitioners to transform the mindstream. Such
liminal times are known in Tibetan Buddhism as Bardo states and include such
transitional states as during meditation, dreaming, sex and death. Death yoga,
or "bringing the three bodies into the path of death, intermediate state
("bardo") and rebirth", helps to prepare the practitioner for what they need to
do at the time of death. Although it is sometimes called "death yoga," it is
mainly practiced during life, in meditation. It can be practiced first
according to generation stage, and then according to completion stage. The
accumulation of meditative practice helps to prepare the practitioner for what
they need to do at the time of death. At the time of death the mind is in a
subtle state (clear light) that can open the mind to enlightenment if it is
skilfully used to meditate on emptiness ("shunyata"). During completion stage
meditation it is possible to manifest a similar clear light mind and to use it
to meditate on emptiness. This meditation causes dualistic appearances to
subside into emptiness and enables the practitioner to destroy their ignorance
and the imprints of ignorance that are the obstructions to omniscience. It is
said that masters like Lama Tsong Khapa used these techniques to achieve
enlightenment during the death process. Actually, there are three stages at
which it is possible to do this: at the end of the death process, during the
"bardo" (or 'in between period') and during the process of rebirth. During
these stages, the mind is in a very subtle state, and an advanced practitioner
can use these natural states to make significant progress on the spiritual
path. The Tibetan Book of the Dead is an important commentary for this kind of
traditional practice. This death yoga should not be confused with the non-
Tantric meditation on impermanence and death, which is a common practice within
Buddhist traditions used to overcome desirous attachment. Another Tibetan
ritual practice related to death is "phowa" (transference of one's
consciousness), which can be done by oneself at the moment of death or by
ritual specialists, "phowa-lamas", on behalf of the dead. For the "Anuttarayoga
Tantras" (Tib. "rnal-‚Äôbyor bla-med-kyi-rgyud"), transferring one‚Äôs
consciousness constitutes one of the two ways to separate the coarse and subtle
bodies through meditation. Daniel Cozort explains that "‚Äôpho-ba" ("phowa")
merely separates the coarse and subtle bodies without leading to the attainment
of an ‚Äúillusory body‚Äù (Tib. "sgyu-lus"). On the other hand, during the
perfection type meditation, known as the ‚Äúfinal mental isolation‚Äù (Tibetan:
"sems-dben") because it necessitates the presence of an ‚Äúactual consort‚Äù
(Tib. "las-rgya"), ‚Äúthe winds are totally dissolved in the indestructible
drop‚Äù, and ‚Äúthe fundamental wind naturally rises into an illusory body‚Äù.
Symbols and imagery. The Vajrayana uses a rich variety of symbols and images.
The Vajra. The Sanskrit term "vajra" denoted the thunderbolt, a legendary
weapon and divine attribute that was made from an adamantine, or
indestructible, substance and which could therefore pierce and penetrate any
obstacle or obfuscation. It is the weapon of choice of Indra, the King of the
Devas in Hinduism. As a secondary meaning, "vajra" refers to this
indestructible substance, and so is sometimes translated as "adamantine" or
"diamond". So the Vajrayana is sometimes rendered in English as "The Adamantine
Vehicle" or "The Diamond Vehicle". A vajra is also a scepter-like ritual object
( "dorje"), which has a sphere (and sometimes a gankyil) at its centre, and a
variable number of spokes, 3, 5 or 9 at each end (depending on the sadhana),
enfolding either end of the rod. The vajra is often traditionally employed in
tantric rituals in combination with the bell or ghanta; symbolically, the vajra
may represent method as well as great bliss and the bell stands for wisdom,
specifically the wisdom realizing emptiness. Imagery and ritual in deity yoga.
Representations of the deity, such as a statues ("murti"), paintings
("thangka"), or mandala, are often employed as an aid to visualization, in
Deity yoga. Mandalas are sacred enclosures, sacred architecture that house and
contain the uncontainable essence of a "yidam". In the book "The World of
Tibetan Buddhism", the Dalai Lama describes mandalas thus: "This is the
celestial mansion, the pure residence of the deity." All ritual in Vajrayana
practice can be seen as aiding in this process of visualization and
identification. The practitioner can use various hand implements such as a
"vajra", bell, hand-drum ("damaru") or a ritual dagger ("phurba"), but also
ritual hand gestures ("mudras") can be made, special chanting techniques can be
used, and in elaborate offering rituals or initiations, many more ritual
implements and tools are used, each with an elaborate symbolic meaning to
create a special environment for practice. Vajrayana has thus become a major
inspiration in traditional Tibetan art. Schools of Vajrayana. Although there is
historical evidence for Vajrayana Buddhism in Southeast Asia and elsewhere (see
History of Vajrayana below), today the Vajrayana exists primarily in the form
of the two major sub-schools of Tibetan Buddhism and Esoteric Buddhism in Japan
known as Shingon, with a handful of minor subschools utilising lesser amounts
of esoteric or tantric materials. The distinction between traditions is not
always rigid. For example, the tantra sections of the Tibetan Buddhist canon of
texts sometimes include material not usually thought of as tantric outside the
Tibetan Buddhist tradition, such as the "Heart Sutra" and even versions of some
material found in the "Pali Canon". Tibetan Buddhism. The Tibetan Buddhist
schools, based on the lineages and textual traditions of the Kangyur and
Tengyur of Tibet, are found in Tibet, Bhutan, northern India, Nepal,
southwestern and northern China, Mongolia and various constituent republics of
Russia that are adjacent to the area, such as Amur Oblast, Buryatia, Chita
Oblast, the Tuva Republic and Khabarovsk Krai. Tibetan Buddhism is also the
main religion in Kalmykia. Vajrayana Buddhism was established in Tibet in the
8th century when ≈öƒÅntarak·π£ita was brought to Tibet from India at the
instigation of the Dharma King Trisong Detsen, some time before 767. He
established the basis of what later came to be known as the Nyingma school. As
a Tantric Mahasiddha Padmasambhava's contribution ensured that Tibetan Buddhism
became part of the Vajrayana tradition. While Vajrayana Buddhism is a part of
Tibetan Buddhism in that it forms a core part of every major Tibetan Buddhist
school, it is not identical with it. Buddhist scholar Alexander Berzin refers
to "the Mahayana and Vajrayana traditions of Tibetan Buddhism". Training in the
"common paths" of Sutra (including Lamrim) are said to be the foundation for
the "uncommon path" of Vajrayana. The Vajrayana techniques add 'skillful means'
to the general Mahayana teachings for advanced students. The 'skillful means'
of the Vajrayana in Tibetan Buddhism refers to tantra techniques, Dzogchen
(Tibetan; Sanskrit:"maha-ati") and Mahamudra (Tibetan:"Chagchen"). Nepalese
Newar Buddhism. Newar Buddhism is practiced by Newars in Nepal. This is the
only form of Vajrayana Buddhism in which the scriptures are written in
Sanskrit. Its priests do not follow celibacy and are called Vajracharyas.
Chinese Esoteric Buddhism. Esoteric traditions in China are similar in
teachings to the Japanese Shingon school, though the number of practitioners
was greatly reduced, due in part of the persecution of Buddhists under Emperor
Wuzong of Tang, nearly wiping out most of the Chinese Esoteric Buddhist
lineage. In China and countries with large Chinese populations such as Taiwan,
Malaysia and Singapore, Chinese Esoteric Buddhism is commonly referred as
T√°ngm√¨ (ÂîêÂØÜ) "Tang Dynasty Secret Buddhism," or H√ nchu√°nm√¨z≈çng
(Êº¢ÂÇ≥ÂØÜÂÆó) "Secret Buddhism of the Han Transmission" (H√ nm√¨ Êº¢ÂØÜ for
short), or D≈çngm√¨ (Êù±ÂØÜ) "Eastern Secret Buddhism." In a more general
sense, the Chinese term M√¨z≈çng (ÂØÜÂÆó) "The Secret Way", is the most popular
term used when referring to any form of Esoteric Buddhism. These traditions
more or less share the same doctrines as the Shingon school, with many of its
students themselves traveling to Japan to be given transmission at Mount Koya.
According to Master Hsuan Hua, the most popular example of esoteric teachings
still practiced in many Zen monasteries of East Asia, is the "" and its
dhƒÅra·πáƒ´ (), along with the Great Compassion Dharani (), with its 42 Hands
and Eyes Mantras. Japan. Shingon Buddhism. The Shingon school is found in Japan
and includes practices, known in Japan as "Mikky≈ç", which are similar in
concept to those in Vajrayana Buddhism. The lineage for Shingon Buddhism
differs from that of Tibetan Vajrayana, having emerged from India during the
9th-11th centuries in the Pala Dynasty and Central Asia (via China) and is
based on earlier versions of the Indian texts than the Tibetan lineage. Shingon
shares material with Tibetan Buddhism‚Äì-such as the esoteric sutras (called
Tantras in Tibetan Buddhism) and mandalas ‚Äì but the actual practices are not
related. The primary texts of Shingon Buddhism are the "Mahavairocana Sutra"
and "Vajrasekhara Sutra". The founder of Shingon Buddhism was Kukai, a Japanese
monk who studied in China in the 9th century during the Tang Dynasty and
brought back Vajrayana scriptures, techniques and mandalas then popular in
China. The school mostly died out or was merged into other schools in China
towards the end of the Tang Dynasty but flourished in Japan. Shingon is one of
the few remaining branches of Buddhism in the world that continues to use the
"siddham" script of the Sanskrit language. Tendai Buddhism. Although the Tendai
school in China and Japan does employ some esoteric practices, these rituals
came to be considered of equal importance with the exoteric teachings of the
"Lotus Sutra". By chanting mantras, maintaining mudras, or practicing certain
forms of meditation, Tendai maintains that one is able to understand sense
experiences as taught by the Buddha, have faith that one is innately an
enlightened being, and that one can attain enlightenment within the current
lifetime. Shugend≈ç. Shugend≈ç was founded in 7th century Japan by the ascetic
En no Gy≈çja, based on the "Queen's Peacocks Sutra". With its origins in the
solitary "hijiri" back in the 7th century, Shugend≈ç evolved as a sort of
amalgamation between Esoteric Buddhism, Shinto and several other religious
influences including Taoism. Buddhism and Shinto were amalgamated in the
"shinbutsu sh≈´g≈ç", and K≈´kai's syncretic view held wide sway up until the
end of the Edo period, coexisting with Shinto elements within Shugend≈ç In 1613
during the Edo period, the Tokugawa Shogunate issued a regulation obliging
Shugend≈ç temples to belong to either Shingon or Tendai temples. During the
Meiji Restoration, when Shinto was declared an independent state religion
separate from Buddhism, Shugend≈ç was banned as a superstition not fit for a
new, enlightened Japan. Some Shugend≈ç temples converted themselves into
various officially approved Shint≈ç denominations. In modern times, Shugend≈ç
is practiced mainly by Tendai and Shingon sects, retaining an influence on
modern Japanese religion and culture. Literary characteristics. Vajrayana texts
exhibit a wide range of literary characteristics‚Äîusually a mix of verse and
prose, almost always in a Sanskrit that "transgresses frequently against
classical norms of grammar and usage," although also occasionally in various
Middle Indic dialects or elegant classical Sanskrit. Dunhuang manuscripts. The
Dunhuang also contains Tibetan Tantric manuscripts. Dalton and Schaik (2007,
revised) provide an excellent online catalogue listing 350 Tibetan Tantric
Manuscripts] from Dunhuang in the Stein Collection of the British Library which
is currently fully accessible online in discrete digitized manuscripts. With
the Wylie transcription of the manuscripts they are to be made discoverable
online in future. The 350 texts is just a small number compared to the vast
cache of the Dunhuang manuscripts. Academic study difficulties. Buddhist
tantric practice are categorized as secret practice; this is to avoid
misinformed people from harmfully misusing the practices. A method to keep this
secrecy is that tantric initiation is required from a Master before any
instructions can be received about the actual practice. During the initiation
procedure in the highest class of tantra (such as the Kalachakra), students
must take the tantric vows which commit them to such secrecy. "Explaining
general tantra theory in a scholarly manner, not sufficient for practice, is
likewise not a root downfall. Nevertheless, it weakens the effectiveness of our
tantric practice."
