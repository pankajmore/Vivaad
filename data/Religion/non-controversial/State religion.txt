State religion A state religion (also called an official religion, established
church or state church) is a religious body or creed officially endorsed by the
state. A state with an official religion, while not secular, is not necessarily
a theocracy. The term "state church" is associated with Christianity,
historically the state church of the Roman Empire, and is sometimes used to
denote a specific modern national branch of Christianity. Closely related to
state churches are what sociologists call ecclesiae, though the two are
slightly different. State religions are official or government-sanctioned
establishments of a religion, but neither does the state need be under the
control of the church (as in a theocracy), nor is the state-sanctioned church
necessarily under the control of the state. The institution of state-sponsored
religious cults is ancient, reaching into the Ancient Near East and prehistory.
The relation of religious cult and the state was discussed by Varro, under the
term of "theologia civilis" ("civic theology"). The first state-sponsored
Christian church was the Armenian Apostolic Church, established in 301 AD.
Types of state religion. The degree and nature of state backing for
denomination or creed designated as a state religion can vary. It can range
from mere endorsement and financial support, with freedom for other faiths to
practice, to prohibiting any competing religious body from operating and to
persecuting the followers of other sects. In Europe, competition between
Catholic and Protestant denominations for state sponsorship in the 16th century
evolved the principle "cuius regio eius religio" ("states follow the religion
of the ruler") embodied in the text of the treaty that marked the Peace of
Augsburg, 1555. In England the monarch imposed Protestantism in 1533, with
himself taking the place of the Pope, while in Scotland the Church of Scotland
opposed the religion of the ruler. In some cases, an administrative region may
sponsor and fund a set of religious denominations; such is the case in Alsace-
Moselle in France under its local law, following the pattern in Germany. In
some communist states, notably in North Korea and Cuba, the state sponsors
religious organizations, and activities outside those state-sponsored religious
organizations are met with various degrees of official disapproval. In these
cases, state religions are widely seen as efforts by the state to prevent
alternate sources of authority. State churches. There is also a difference
between a "state church" and the broader term of "state religion". A "state
church" is a state religion created by a state for use exclusively by that
state, examples of which include the Church of England (which previously was a
Catholic church until it was separated by Henry VIII in 1534). An example of a
"state religion" that's not also a "state church", is Roman Catholicism in
Costa Rica which was accepted as the state religion in the 1949 Constitution,
despite the lack of a national church. In the case of the former, the state has
absolute control over the church, but in the case of the latter the church is
ruled by an exterior body (in the case of Catholicism, the Vatican has control
over the church). In either case, the official state religion has some
influence over the ruling of the state. As of 2012, there are only five state
churches left, as most countries which once featured state churches have
separated church and state, thus downgrading their state churches to "national
churches". The most recent country to separate church and state was Norway in
2012. Disestablishment. Disestablishment is the process of depriving a church
of its status as an organ of the state. Opponents of disestablishment may be
called by one of the longest words in the English language:
"antidisestablishmentarians". Current state religions. Currently, the following
religions are recognized as state religions in some countries (all are a
variation of Christianity, Islam or Buddhism). Christian countries. Catholic.
The large portion of western Europe which previously held to the Catholic
religion was known as Christendom, which was nominally headed by the Holy Roman
Empire, a Catholic federation; after the advent of Protestantism and the
subsequent Enlightenment, Christendom slowly collapsed as different states
declared themselves Protestant or separated the Church from the state
altogether. A number of countries, including Andorra, Argentina, Dominican
Republic, El Salvador, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Poland, Philippines, Portugal
and Spain give a special recognition to Catholicism in their constitution
despite not making it the state religion. All Cantons in Switzerland give
official recognition to the main churches, i. e. both the Roman Catholic Church
and the Swiss Reformed Church, except Geneva and NeuchÃ¢tel. Switzerland itself
has no official religion. Eastern Orthodox. The Finnish Orthodox Church is not
the state religion of Finland but has a special relationship with the Finnish
state. The internal structure of the church is described in the Orthodox Church
Act. The church has a power to tax its members and corporations if a majority
of shareholders are members. The church does not consider itself a state
church, as the state does not have the authority to affect its internal
workings or theology. Protestantism. Lutheran. Jurisdictions which recognize a
Lutheran church as their state religion include the Nordic countries.
Membership is very high among the general population, however the amount of
actively participating members and believers is considerably lower than in many
other countries with similar membership statistics. Furthermore, all of these
churches have lately seen decline in the fraction of the population being
members. The Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland has a special relationship
with the Finnish state, its internal structure being described in a special
law, the Church Act. The Church Act can be amended only by a decision of the
Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church and subsequent ratification by the
parliament. The Church Act is protected by the Finnish constitution, and the
state can not change the Church Act without changing the constitution. The
church has a power to tax its members and all corporations unless a majority of
shareholders are members of the Finnish Orthodox Church. The state collects
these taxes for the church, for a fee. On the other hand, the church is
required to give a burial place for everyone in its graveyards. (79% of
population members at the end of 2009). The Finnish president also decides the
themes for the intercession days. The church does not consider itself a state
church, as the Finnish state does not have the power to influence its internal
workings or its theology, although it has a veto in those changes of the
internal structure which require changing the Church Act. Neither does the
Finnish state accord any precedence to Lutherans or the Lutheran faith in its
own acts. Sweden relegated their state church, Church of Sweden, to a national
church in 2000. In late 2009 the Church of Sweden had 71.3% of the population
as its members in 2009 although only around 20% of the Swedish population
believes in any religion. Memberships are high because until 1996 membership
was compulsory, all born before 1996 have to actively leave the church.
Reformed. The Church of Scotland is recognized as the national church of
Scotland, but is not a state church and thus differs from the Church of
England. Its constitution, which is recognised by acts of the British
Parliament, gives it complete independence from the state in spiritual matters.
All Cantons in Switzerland give official recognition to the main churches, i.
e. both the Swiss Reformed Church and the Roman Catholic Church, except Geneva
and NeuchÃ¢tel. Switzerland itself has no official religion. Anglican. The
Church of England is the officially established religious institution in
England, and also the Mother Church of the worldwide Anglican Communion. It is
the only established Anglican Church. The British monarch is the Supreme
Governor of the Church of England and is Defender of the Faith. In late-19th-
century England there was a campaign by Liberals, dissenters and nonconformists
to disestablish the Church of England, which was viewed, in the period after
civil Chartist activism, as a discriminatory organisation placing employment
and other access disabilities on non-members. The campaigners styled themselves
"Liberationists" (the "Liberation Society" was founded by Edward Miall in
1853). Though their campaign failed, nearly all of the legal disabilities of
nonconformists were gradually dismantled. The campaign for disestablishment was
revived in the 20th century when Parliament rejected the 1929 revision of the
Book of Common Prayer, leading to calls for separation of Church and State to
prevent political interference in matters of worship. Lords Spiritual, who are
the 26 most senior Archbishops and Bishops in the Church are reserved seats in
Parliament in the House of Lords. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Archbishop of
York, Bishop of London, Bishop of Durham, and the Bishop of Winchester sit
automatically with the 21 longest-serving Bishops. Both the Labour Party and
the Conservative Party have proposed reserved seats for the Lords Spiritual in
a reformed House of Lords which would contain elected members. Plans to reform
the house however, have been abandoned for this current Parliament and so all
26 Lords Spiritual remain in their reserved seats. Muslim countries. Many
Muslim-majority countries recognize Islam as their state religion. Proselytism
on behalf of other religions is often illegal. Buddhist countries. Theravada
Buddhism. The constitution in Sri Lanka accords Buddhism the "foremost place,"
However, Buddhism is not recognized as the state religion. Likewise, in
Thailand, the 2007 Thai constitution recognized Buddhism as "the religion of
Thai tradition with the most adherents" However, it is not formally named as
state religion. Vajrayana Buddhism. 1. Buddhism is the spiritual heritage of
Bhutan, which promotes the principles and values of peace, non-violence,
compassion and tolerance. 2. The Druk Gyalpo is the protector of all religions
in Bhutan. 3. It shall be the responsibility of religious institutions and
personalities to promote the spiritual heritage of the country while also
ensuring that religion remains separate from politics in Bhutan. Religious
institutions and personalities shall remain above politics. 4. The Druk Gyalpo
shall, on the recommendation of the Five Lopons, appoint a learned and
respected monk ordained in accordance with the Druk-lu, blessed with the nine
qualities of a spiritual master and accomplished in ked-dzog, as the Je Khenpo.
5. His Holiness the Je Khenpo shall, on the recommendation of the Dratshang
Lhentshog, appoint monks blessed with the nine qualities of a spiritual master
and accomplished in ked-dzog as the Five Lopons. Â (a) The Je Khenpo as
Chairman; Â (b) The Five Lopons of the Zhung Dratshang; and Â (c) The Secretary
of the Dratshang Lhentshog who is a civil servant. 7. The Zhung Dratshang and
Rabdeys shall continue to receive adequate funds and other facilities from the
State. Jewish countries. Israel is defined in several of its laws as a "Jewish
and democratic state" ("medina yehudit ve-demokratit"). However, the term
"Jewish" is a polyseme that can relate equally to the Jewish people or religion
(see: Who is a Jew?). The debate about the meaning of the term Jewish and its
legal and social applications is one of the most profound issues with which
Israeli society deals. At present, there is no specific law or official
statement establishing the Jewish "religion" as the state's religion. However,
the State of Israel supports religious institutions, particularly Orthodox
Jewish ones, and recognizes the "religious communities" as carried over from
those recognized under the British Mandate. These are: Jewish and Christian
(Eastern Orthodox, Latin Gregorian-Armenian, Armenian-Catholic, Syrian
[Catholic, Chaldean Greek Catholic Melkite, Maronite, and Syrian Orthodox). The
fact that the Muslim population was not defined as a religious community is a
vestige of the Ottoman period during which Islam was the dominant religion and
does not affect the rights of the Muslim community to practice their faith. At
the end of the period covered by this report, several of these denominations
were pending official government recognition; however, the Government has
allowed adherents of not officially recognized groups freedom to practice. In
1961, legislation gave Muslim Shari'a courts exclusive jurisdiction in matters
of personal status. Three additional religious communities have subsequently
been recognized by Israeli law â€“ the Druze (prior under Islamic
jurisdiction), the Evangelical Episcopal Church, and the BahÃ¡'Ã­. These groups
have their own religious courts as official state courts for personal status
matters (see millet system). The structure and goals of the Chief Rabbinate of
Israel are governed by Israeli law, but the law does not say explicitly that it
is a state Rabbinate. However, outspoken Israeli secularists such as Shulamit
Aloni and Uri Avnery have long maintained that it is that in practice. Non-
recognition of other streams of Judaism such as Reform Judaism and Conservative
Judaism is the cause of some controversy; rabbis belonging to these currents
are not recognized as such by state institutions and marriages performed by
them are not recognized as valid. marriage in Israel provides no provision for
civil marriage, marriage between people of different religions, marriages by
people who do not belong to one of nine recognised religious communities, or
same-sex marriages, although there is recognition of marriages performed
abroad. Ancient state religions. Egypt and Sumer. The concept of state
religions was known as long ago as the empires of Egypt and Sumer, when every
city state or people had its own god or gods. Many of the early Sumerian rulers
were priests of their patron city god. Some of the earliest semi-mythological
kings may have passed into the pantheon, like Dumuzid, and some later kings
came to be viewed as divine soon after their reigns, like Sargon the Great of
Akkad. One of the first rulers to be proclaimed a god during his actual reign
was Gudea of Lagash, followed by some later kings of Ur, such as Shulgi. Often,
the state religion was integral to the power base of the reigning government,
such as in Egypt, where Pharaohs were often thought of as embodiments of the
god Horus. Sassanid Empire. Zoroastrianism was the state religion of the
Sassanid dynasty which lasted until 651, when Persia was conquered by the
forces of Islam. However, it persisted as the state religion of the independent
state of Hyrcania until the 15th century. The tiny kingdom of Adiabene in
northern Mesopotamia converted to Judaism around 34 AD. Greek city-states. Many
of the Greek city-states also had a 'god' or 'goddess' associated with that
city. This would not be the 'only god' of the city, but the one that received
special honors. In ancient Greece the city of Athens had Athena, Sparta had
Ares, Delphi had Apollo and Artemis, Olympia had Zeus, Corinth had Poseidon and
Thebes had Demeter. Roman religion and Christianity. In Rome, the office of
"Pontifex Maximus" came to be reserved for the Emperor, who was often declared
a god posthumously, or sometimes during his reign. Failure to worship the
Emperor as a god was at times punishable by death, as the Roman government
sought to link emperor worship with loyalty to the Empire. Many Christians and
Jews were subject to persecution, torture and death in the Roman Empire,
because it was against their beliefs to worship the Emperor. In 311, Emperor
Galerius, on his deathbed, declared a religious indulgence to Christians
throughout the Roman Empire, focusing on the ending of anti-Christian
persecution. Constantine I and Licinius, the two "Augusti", by the Edict of
Milan of 313, enacted a law allowing religious freedom to everyone within the
Roman Empire. Furthermore, the Edict of Milan cited that Christians may openly
practice their religion unmolested and unrestricted, and provided that
properties taken from Christians be returned to them unconditionally. Although
the Edict of Milan allowed religious freedom throughout the Empire, it did not
abolish nor disestablish the Roman state cult (Roman polytheistic paganism).
The Edict of Milan was written in such a way as to implore the blessings of the
deity. Constantine called up the First Council of Nicaea in 325, although he
was not a baptised Christian until years later. Despite enjoying considerable
popular support, Christianity was still not the official state religion in
Rome, although it was in some neighboring states such as Armenia and Aksum.
Roman Religion (Neoplatonic Hellenism) was restored for a time by Julian the
Apostate from 361 to 363. Julian does not appear to have reinstated the
persecutions of the earlier Roman emperors. Catholic Christianity, as opposed
to Arianism and other ideologies deemed heretical, was declared to be the state
religion of the Roman Empire on 27 February 380 by the decree "De Fide
Catolica" of Emperor Theodosius I. Han Dynasty Confucianism. In China, the Han
Dynasty (206 BC â€“ 220 AD) advocated Confucianism as the "de facto" state
religion, establishing tests based on Confucian texts as an entrance
requirement into government serviceâ€”although, in fact, the "Confucianism"
advocated by the Han emperors may be more properly termed a sort of Confucian
Legalism or "State Confucianism". This sort of Confucianism continued to be
regarded by the emperors, with a few notable exceptions, as a form of state
religion from this time until the overthrow of the imperial system of
government in 1911. Note however, there is a debate over whether Confucianism
(including Neo-confucianism) is a religion or purely a philosophical system.
Modern era. Empire of Japan. From the Meiji era to the first part of the Showa
era, " Koshitsu Shinto" was established in Japan as the national religion.
According to this, the Emperor of Japan was an arahitogami, an incarnate
divinity and the offspring of goddess Amaterasu. As the Emperor was, according
to the constitution, "head of the empire" and "supreme commander of the Army
and the Navy", every Japanese citizen had to obey his will and show absolute
loyalty. States/Countries without a state religion. A state that does not
profess a state religion is known as a "Secular state". Former state churches
in British North America. Tabular summary.  this is the date of permanent legal
abolition. "Article IV. Section 10. No person within this state shall, upon any
pretense, be deprived of the inestimable privilege of worshipping God in any
manner agreeable to his own conscience, nor be compelled to attend any place of
worship contrary to his own faith and judgment; nor shall he ever be obliged to
pay tithes, taxes, or any other rate, for the building or repairing any place
of worship, or for the maintenance of any minister or ministry, contrary to
what he believes to be right, or hath voluntarily engaged. To do. No one
religious society shall ever be established in this state, in preference to
another; nor shall any person be denied the enjoyment of any civil right merely
on account of his religious principles." From 1780 Massachusetts had a system
which required every man to belong to a church, and permitted each church to
tax its members, but forbade any law requiring that it be of any particular
denomination. This was objected to, as in practice establishing the
Congregational Church, the majority denomination, and was abolished in 1833.
Until 1877 the New Hampshire Constitution required members of the State
legislature to be of the Protestant religion. The North Carolina Constitution
of 1776 disestablished the Anglican church, but until 1835 the NC Constitution
allowed only Protestants to hold public office. From 1835â€“1876 it allowed
only Christians (including Catholics) to hold public office. Article VI,
Section 8 of the current NC Constitution forbids only atheists from holding
public office. Such clauses were held by the United States Supreme Court to be
unenforceable in the 1961 case of Torcaso v. Watkins, when the court ruled
unanimously that such clauses constituted a religious test incompatible with
First and Fourteenth Amendment protections. Religious tolerance for Catholics
with an established Church of England was policy in the former Spanish Colonies
of East and West Florida while under British rule. In 1783 Peace of Paris,
which ended the American Revolutionary War, the British ceded both East and
West Florida back to Spain (see Spanish Florida). Tithes for the support of the
Anglican Church in Virginia were suspended in 1776, and never restored. 1786 is
the date of the Virginia Statute of Religious Freedom, which prohibited any
coercion to support any religious body. Non-Anglo-American colonies. In both
cases, these areas were disestablished and dissolved, yet their presences were
tolerated by the Anglo-American government, as Foreign Protestants, whose
communities were expected to observe their own ways without causing controversy
or conflict for the prevalent colonists. After the Revolution, their ethno-
religious backgrounds were chiefly sought as the most compatible non-British
Isles immigrants. State of Deseret. The State of Deseret was a provisional
state of the United States, proposed in 1849 by Mormon settlers in Salt Lake
City. The provisional state existed for slightly over two years, but attempts
to gain recognition by the United States government floundered for various
reasons. The Utah Territory which was then founded was under Mormon control,
and repeated attempts to gain statehood met resistance, in part due to concerns
over the principle of separation of church and state conflicting with the
practice of members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints of
placing their highest value on "following counsel" in virtually all matters
relating to their church-centered lives. The state of Utah was eventually
admitted to the union on 4 January 1896, after the various issues had been
resolved.
