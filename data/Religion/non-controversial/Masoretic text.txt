Masoretic Text The Masoretic Text (MT, ùï∏, or formula_1) is the authoritative
Hebrew text of the Jewish Bible. While the Masoretic Text defines the books of
the Jewish canon, it also defines the precise letter-text of these biblical
books, with their vocalization and accentuation known as the Masorah. The MT is
also widely used as the basis for translations of the Old Testament in
Protestant Bibles, and in recent years (since 1943) also for some Catholic
Bibles, although the Eastern Orthodox continue to use the Septuagint, as they
hold it to be divinely inspired. In modern times the Dead Sea Scrolls have
shown the MT to be nearly identical to some texts of the Tanakh dating from 200
BCE but different from others. The MT was primarily copied, edited and
distributed by a group of Jews known as the Masoretes between the 7th and 10th
centuries CE. Though the consonants differ little from the text generally
accepted in the early 2nd century (and also differ little from some Qumran
texts that are even older), it has numerous differences of both greater and
lesser significance when compared to (extant 4th century) manuscripts of the
Septuagint, a Greek translation (made in the 3rd to 2nd centuries BCE) of the
Hebrew Scriptures that was in popular use in Egypt and Israel and that is
believed by scholars to be the source often quoted in the New Testament. The
Hebrew word "" (, alt. ) refers to the transmission of a tradition. In a very
broad sense it can refer to the entire chain of Jewish tradition (see Oral
law), but in reference to the Masoretic Text the word "mesorah" has a very
specific meaning: the diacritic markings of the text of the Hebrew Bible and
concise marginal notes in manuscripts (and later printings) of the Hebrew Bible
which note textual details, usually about the precise spelling of words. The
oldest extant manuscripts of the Masoretic Text date from approximately the 9th
century CE, and the Aleppo Codex (once the oldest complete copy of the
Masoretic Text, but now missing its Torah section) dates from the 10th century.
Origin and transmission. The Talmud (and also Karaite mss.) states that a
standard copy of the Hebrew Bible was kept in the court of the Temple in
Jerusalem for the benefit of copyists; there were paid correctors of Biblical
books among the officers of the Temple (Talmud, tractate Ketubot 106a). This
copy is mentioned in the Aristeas Letter (¬ß 30; comp. Blau, "Studien zum
Althebr. Buchwesen", p.¬ 100); in the statements of Philo (preamble to his
"Analysis of the Political Constitution of the Jews") and in Josephus ("Contra
Ap." i. 8). Another Talmudic story, perhaps referring to an earlier time,
relates that three Torah scrolls were found in the Temple court but were at
variance with each other. The differences were then resolved by majority
decision among the three. Second Temple period. The discovery of the Dead Sea
Scrolls at Qumran, dating from c.150 BCE-75 CE, shows however that in this
period there was not always the scrupulous uniformity of text that was so
stressed in later centuries. The scrolls show numerous small variations in
orthography, both as against the later Masoretic text, and between each other.
It is also evident from the notings of corrections and of variant alternatives
that scribes felt free to choose according to their personal taste and
discretion between different readings. However, despite these variations, most
of the Qumran fragments can be classified as being closer to the Masoretic text
than to any other text group that has survived. According to Shiffman, 60% can
be classed as being of proto-Masoretic type, and a further 20% Qumran style
with bases in proto-Masoretic texts, compared to 5% proto-Samaritan type, 5%
Septuagintal type, and 10% non-aligned. Joseph Fitzmyer noted the following
regarding the findings at Qumran Cave Four in particular; "Such ancient
recensional forms of Old Testament books bear witness to an unsuspected textual
diversity that once existed; these texts merit far greater study and attention
than they have been accorded till now. Thus, the differences in the Septuagint
are no longer considered the result of a poor or tendentious attempt to
translate the Hebrew into the Greek; rather they testify to a different pre-
Christian form of the Hebrew text". On the other hand, some of the fragments
conforming most accurately to the Masoretic text were found in Cave 4. Rabbinic
period. An emphasis on minute details of words and spellings, already used
among the Pharisees as bases for argumentation, reached its height with the
example of Rabbi Akiva (d. 135 CE). The idea of a perfect text sanctified in
its consonantal base quickly spread throughout the Jewish communities via
supportive statements in Halakha, Aggada, and Jewish thought; and with it
increasingly forceful strictures that a deviation in even a single letter would
make a Torah scroll invalid. Very few manuscripts are said to have survived the
destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE. This both drastically reduced the number of
variants in circulation, and gave a new urgency that the text must be
preserved. New Greek translations were also made. Unlike the Septuagint, large-
scale deviations in sense between the Greek of Aquila and Theodotion and what
we now know as the Masoretic text are minimal. Detailed variations between
different Hebrew texts in use still clearly existed though, as witnessed by
differences between the present-day Masoretic text and versions mentioned in
the Gemara, and often even Halachic midrashim based on spelling versions which
do not exist in the current Masoretic text. (Mostly, however, these variations
are limited to whether particular words should be written plene or defectively
- i.e. whether a mater lectionis consonant to represent a particular vowel
sound should or should not be included in a particular word at a particular
point. There is no difference in meaning.) The Age of the Masoretes. The
current received text finally achieved predominance through the reputation of
the Masoretes, schools of scribes and Torah scholars working between the 7th
and 11th centuries, based primarily in the Land of Israel in the cities of
Tiberias and Jerusalem, and in Babylonia. These schools developed such prestige
for the accuracy and error-control of their copying techniques that their texts
established an authority beyond all others. Differences remained, sometimes
bolstered by systematic local differences in pronunciation and cantillation.
Every locality, following the tradition of its school, had a standard codex
embodying its readings. In Babylonia the school of Sura differed from that of
Nehardea; and similar differences existed in the schools of the Land of Israel
as against that at Tiberias, which in later times increasingly became the chief
seat of learning. In this period living tradition ceased, and the Masoretes in
preparing their codices usually followed the one school or the other,
examining, however, standard codices of other schools and noting their
differences. ben Asher and ben Naphtali. In the first half of the 10th century
Aaron ben Moses ben Asher and Moshe ben Naphtali (often just called ben Asher
and ben Naphtali) were the leading Masoretes in Tiberias. Their names have come
to symbolise the variations among Masoretes, but the differences between ben
Asher and ben Naphtali should not be exaggerated. There are hardly any
differences between them regarding the consonants, though they differ more on
vocalization and accents. Also, there were other authorities such as Rabbi
Pinchas and Moshe Moheh, and ben Asher and ben Naphtali often agree against
these others. Further, it is possible that all variations found among
manuscripts eventually came to be regarded as disagreements between these
figureheads. Ben Asher wrote a standard codex (the Aleppo Codex) embodying his
opinions. Probably ben Naphtali did too, but it has not survived. It has been
suggested that there never was an actual "ben Naphtali"; rather, the name was
chosen (based on the Bible, where Asher and Naphtali are the younger sons of
Zilpah and Bilhah) to designate any tradition different from Ben Asher's. This
is unlikely, as there exist lists of places where ben Asher and ben Naphtali
agree against other authorities. Ben Asher was the last of a distinguished
family of Masoretes extending back to the latter half of the 8th century.
Despite the rivalry of ben Naphtali and the opposition of Saadia Gaon, the most
eminent representative of the Babylonian school of criticism, ben Asher's codex
became recognized as the standard text of the Bible. See Aleppo Codex, Codex
Cairensis. The Middle Ages. The two rival authorities, ben Asher and ben
Naphtali, practically brought the Masorah to a close. Very few additions were
made by the later Masoretes, styled in the 13th and 14th centuries Na·∏≥danim,
who revised the works of the copyists, added the vowels and accents (generally
in fainter ink and with a finer pen) and frequently the Masorah. Considerable
influence on the development and spread of Masoretic literature was exercised
during the eleventh, twelfth, and 13th centuries by the Franco-German school of
Tosafists. R. Gershom, his brother Machir, Joseph ben Samuel Bonfils (Tob
'Elem) of Limoges, R. Tam (Jacob ben Me√Ør), Menahem ben Perez of Joigny, Perez
ben Elijah of Corbeil, Judah of Paris, Me√Ør Spira, and R. Me√Ør of Rothenburg
made Masoretic compilations, or additions to the subject, which are all more or
less frequently referred to in the marginal glosses of Biblical codices and in
the works of Hebrew grammarians. Many believe that the ben Asher family were
Karaites. Masorah. By long tradition, a ritual Torah scroll shall contain only
the Hebrew consonantal text - nothing may be added, nothing taken away.
However, perhaps because they were intended for personal study rather than
ritual use, the Masoretic codices provide extensive additional material, called
"masorah", to show correct pronunciation and cantillation, protect against
scribal errors, and annotate possible variants. The manuscripts thus include
vowel points, pronunciation marks and stress accents in the text, short
annotations in the side margins, and longer more extensive notes in the upper
and lower margins and collected at the end of each book. Etymology. The Hebrew
word "masorah" is taken from Ezekiel 20:37 and means originally "fetter". The
fixation of the text was considered to be in the nature of a fetter upon its
exposition. When, in the course of time, the Masorah had become a traditional
discipline, the term became connected with the verb ( = "to hand down"), and
acquired the general meaning of "tradition." Language and form. The language of
the Masoretic notes is primarily Aramaic but partly Hebrew. The Masoretic
annotations are found in various forms: (a) in separate works, e.g., the "Oklah
we-Oklah"; (b) in the form of notes written in the margins and at the end of
codices. In rare cases, the notes are written between the lines. The first word
of each Biblical book is also as a rule surrounded by notes. The latter are
called the Initial Masorah; the notes on the side margins or between the
columns are called the Small ("Masora parva" or Mp) or Inner Masorah (Masora
marginalis); and those on the lower and upper margins, the Large or Outer
Masorah ("Masora magna" or Mm[Mas.M]). The name "Large Masorah" is applied
sometimes to the lexically arranged notes at the end of the printed Bible,
usually called the Final Masorah ("Masora finalis"), or the Masoretic
Concordance. The Small Masorah consists of brief notes with reference to
marginal readings, to statistics showing the number of times a particular form
is found in Scripture, to full and defective spelling, and to abnormally
written letters. The Large Masorah is more copious in its notes. The Final
Masorah comprises all the longer rubrics for which space could not be found in
the margin of the text, and is arranged alphabetically in the form of a
concordance. The quantity of notes the marginal Masorah contains is conditioned
by the amount of vacant space on each page. In the manuscripts it varies also
with the rate at which the copyist was paid and the fanciful shape he gave to
his gloss. In most manuscripts, there are some discrepancies between the text
and the masorah, suggesting that they were copied from different sources or
that one of them has copying errors. The lack of such discrepancies in the
Aleppo Codex is one of the reasons for its importance; the scribe who copied
the notes, presumably Aaron ben Moses ben Asher, probably wrote them
originally. Numerical Masorah. In classical antiquity, copyists were paid for
their work according to the number of (lines of verse). As the prose books of
the Bible were hardly ever written in stichs, the copyists, in order to
estimate the amount of work, had to count the letters. For the Masoretic Text,
such statistical information more importantly also ensured accuracy in the
transmission of the text with the production of subsequent copies that were
done by hand. Hence the Masoretes contributed the Numerical Masorah. These
notes are traditionally categorized into two main groups: the marginal Masorah
and the final Masorah. The category of marginal Masorah is further divided into
the Masorah parva (small Masorah) in the outer side margins and the Masorah
magna (large Masorah), traditionally located at the top and bottom margins of
the text. The Masorah parva is a set of statistics in the outer side margins of
the text. Beyond simply counting the letters, the Masorah parva consists of
word-use statistics, similar documentation for expressions or certain
phraseology, observations on full or defective writing, references to the
Kethiv-Qere readings and more. These observations are also the result of a
passionate zeal to safeguard the accurate transmission of the sacred text. Even
though often cited as very exact, the masoretic "frequency notes" in the margin
of Codex Leningradiensis contain several errors. The Masorah magna, in measure,
is an expanded Masorah parva. It is not printed in BHS. The final Masorah is
located at the end of biblical books or after certain sections of the text,
such as at the end of the Torah. It contains information and statistics
regarding the number of words in a book or section, etc. Thus (Leviticus 8:23)
is the middle verse in the Pentateuch; all the names of Divinity mentioned in
connection with Abraham are holy except (Genesis 18:3); ten passages in the
Pentateuch are dotted; three times the Pentateuch has the spelling ◊ú◊ê where
the reading is ◊ú◊ï. The collation of manuscripts and the noting of their
differences furnished material for the Text-Critical Masorah. The close
relation which existed in earlier times (from the Soferim to the Amoraim
inclusive) between the teacher of tradition and the Masorete, both frequently
being united in one person, accounts for the Exegetical Masorah. Finally, the
invention and introduction of a graphic system of vocalization and accentuation
gave rise to the Grammatical Masorah. The most important of the Masoretic notes
are those that detail the Kethiv-Qere that are located in the Masorah parva in
the outside margins of BHS. Given that the Masoretes would not alter the sacred
consonantal text, the Kethiv-Qere notes were a way of "correcting" or
commenting on the text for any number of reasons (grammatical, theological,
aesthetic, etc.) deemed important by the copyist. Pratico and Van Pelt, Basics
of Biblical Hebrew, Zondervan. 2001. p406ff Fixing of the text. The earliest
labors of the Masoretes included standardizing division of the text into books,
sections, paragraphs, verses, and clauses (probably in the chronological order
here enumerated); the fixing of the orthography, pronunciation, and
cantillation; the introduction or final adoption of the square characters with
the five final letters (comp. Numbers and Numerals); some textual changes to
guard against blasphemy and the like (though these changes may pre-date the
Masoretes - see Tikkune Soferim); the enumeration of letters, words, verses,
etc., and the substitution of some words for others in public reading. Since no
additions were allowed to be made to the official text of the Bible, the early
Masoretes adopted other expedients: e.g., they marked the various divisions by
spacing, and gave indications of halakic and haggadic teachings by full or
defective spelling, abnormal forms of letters, dots, and other signs. Marginal
notes were permitted only in private copies, and the first mention of such
notes is found in the case of R. Me√Ør (c. 100-150 CE). Scribal emendations -
"Tikkune Soferim". Early rabbinic sources, from around 200 CE, mention several
passages of Scripture in which the conclusion is inevitable that the ancient
reading must have differed from that of the present text. The explanation of
this phenomenon is given in the expression ("Scripture has used euphemistic
language", i.e. to avoid anthropomorphism and anthropopathy). Rabbi Simon ben
Pazzi (3rd century) calls these readings "emendations of the Scribes" ("tikkune
Soferim"; Midrash Genesis Rabbah xlix. 7), assuming that the Scribes actually
made the changes. This view was adopted by the later Midrash and by the
majority of Masoretes. In Masoretic works these changes are ascribed to Ezra;
to Ezra and Nehemiah; to Ezra and the Soferim; or to Ezra, Nehemiah, Zechariah,
Haggai, and Baruch. All these ascriptions mean one and the same thing: that the
changes were assumed to have been made by the Men of the Great Synagogue. The
term "tikkun Soferim" (◊™◊ß◊ï◊ü ◊°◊ï◊§◊®◊ô◊ù) has been understood by different
scholars in various ways. Some regard it as a correction of Biblical language
authorized by the Soferim for homiletical purposes. Others take it to mean a
mental change made by the original writers or redactors of Scripture; i.e. the
latter shrank from putting in writing a thought which some of the readers might
expect them to express. Mikra and ittur. Among the earliest technical terms
used in connection with activities of the Scribes are the "mikra Soferim" and
"ittur Soferim." In the geonic schools, the first term was taken to signify
certain vowel-changes which were made in words in pause or after the article;
the second, the cancellation in a few passages of the "vav" conjunctive, where
it had by some been wrongly read. The objection to such an explanation is that
the first changes would fall under the general head of fixation of
pronunciation, and the second under the head of "Qere" and "Ketiv" (i.e. "What
is read" and "What is written"). Various explanations have, therefore, been
offered by ancient as well as modern scholars without, however, succeeding in
furnishing a completely satisfactory solution. Suspended letters and dotted
words. There are four words having one of their letters suspended above the
line. One of them, (Judges 18:30), is due to an alteration of the original out
of reverence for Moses; rather than say that Moses' grandson became an
idolatrous priest, a suspended letter nun¬ (¬ ◊ ¬ ) was inserted to turn Mosheh
into Menasheh (Manasseh). The origin of the other three (Psalm 80:14; Job 38:
13, 15) is doubtful. According to some, they are due to mistaken majuscular
letters; according to others, they are later insertions of originally omitted
weak consonants. In fifteen passages in the Bible, some words are stigmatized;
i.e., dots appear above the letters. (Gen 16:5, 18:9, 19:33, 33:4, 37:12, Num
3:39, 9:10, 21:30, 29:15, Deut. 29:28, 2Sam 19:20, Isaiah 44:9, Ez 41:20, 46:
22, Ps 27:13) The significance of the dots is disputed. Some hold them to be
marks of erasure; others believe them to indicate that in some collated
manuscripts the stigmatized words were missing, hence that the reading is
doubtful; still others contend that they are merely a mnemonic device to
indicate homiletical explanations which the ancients had connected with those
words; finally, some maintain that the dots were designed to guard against the
omission by copyists of text-elements which, at first glance or after
comparison with parallel passages, seemed to be superfluous. Instead of dots
some manuscripts exhibit strokes, vertical or else horizontal. The first two
explanations are unacceptable for the reason that such faulty readings would
belong to Qere and Ketiv, which, in case of doubt, the majority of manuscripts
would decide. The last two theories have equal probability. Inverted letters.
In nine passages of the Bible are found signs usually called "inverted nuns",
because they resemble the Hebrew letter nun¬ (¬ ◊ ¬ ) written in some inverted
fashion. The exact shape varies between different manuscripts and printed
editions. In many manuscripts, a reversed nun is found‚Äîreferred to as a "nun
hafucha" by the masoretes. In some earlier printed editions, they are shown as
the standard nun upside down or rotated, because the printer did not want to
bother to design a character to be used only nine times. The recent scholarly
editions of the Masoretic Text show the reversed nun as described by the
masoretes. In some manuscripts, however, other symbols are occasionally found
instead. These are sometimes referred to in rabbinical literature as
"simaniyot" (markers). The primary set of inverted nuns is found surrounding
the text of Numbers 10:35-36. The Mishna notes that this text is 85 letters
long and dotted. This demarcation of this text leads to the later use of the
inverted nun markings. Saul Lieberman demonstrated that similar markings can be
found in ancient Greek texts where they are also used to denote 'short texts'.
During the Medieval period, the inverted nuns were actually inserted into the
text of the early Rabbinic Bibles published by Bomberg in the early 16th
century. The talmud records that the markings surrounding Numbers 10:35 - 36
were thought to denote that this 85 letter text was not in its proper place.
Bar Kappara considered the Torah known to us as composed of seven volumes in
the Gemara "The seven pillars with which Wisdom built her house (Prov. 9:1) are
the seven Books of Moses". Genesis, Exodus and Leviticus and Deuteronomy as we
know them but Numbers was really three separate volumes Num 1:1 to Num 10:35
followed by Number 10:35-36 and the third text from there to the end of
Numbers. The 85 letter text is also said to be denoted because it is the model
for the least number of letters which constitute a 'text' which one would be
required to save from fire due to its holiness. History of the Masorah. The
history of the Masorah may be divided into three periods: (1) creative period,
from its beginning to the introduction of vowel-signs;)(2) reproductive period,
from the introduction of vowel-signs to the printing of the Masorah (1525); (3)
critical period, from 1525 to the present time. The materials for the history
of the first period are scattered remarks in Talmudic and Midrashic literature,
in the post-Talmudical treatises "Masseket Sefer Torah" and "Masseket Soferim",
and in a Masoretic chain of tradition found in ben Asher's "Di·∏≥du·∏≥e ha-
·π¨e'amim", ¬ß 69 and elsewhere. Critical study. Jacob ben Hayyim ibn Adonijah,
having collated a vast number of manuscripts, systematized his material and
arranged the Masorah in the second Bomberg edition of the Bible (Venice,
1524‚Äì25). Besides introducing the Masorah into the margin, he compiled at the
close of his Bible a concordance of the Masoretic glosses for which he could
not find room in a marginal form, and added an elaborate introduction ‚Äì the
first treatise on the Masorah ever produced. In spite of its numerous errors,
this work has been considered by some as the "textus receptus" of the Masorah
(W√ºrthwein 1995:39), and was used for the English translation of the Old
Testament for the King James Version of the Bible. Next to Ibn Adonijah the
critical study of the Masorah has been most advanced by Elijah Levita, who
published his famous "Massoret ha-Massoret" in 1538. The "Tiberias" of the
elder Buxtorf (1620) made Levita's researches more accessible to a Christian
audience. The eighth prolegomenon to Walton's Polyglot Bible is largely a
r√©chauff√© (reworking) of the "Tiberias". Levita compiled likewise a vast
Masoretic concordance, "Sefer ha-Zikronot", which still lies in the National
Library at Paris unpublished. The study is indebted also to R. Me√Ør b. Todros
ha-Levi (RaMaH), who, as early as the 13th century, wrote his "Sefer Massoret
Seyag la-Torah" (correct ed. Florence, 1750); to Menahem Lonzano, who composed
a treatise on the Masorah of the Pentateuch entitled "Or Torah"; and in
particular to Jedidiah Norzi, whose "Min·∏•at Shai" contains valuable Masoretic
notes based on a careful study of manuscripts. The Dead Sea Scrolls have shed
new light on the history of the Masoretic Text. Many texts found there,
especially those from Masada, are quite similar to the Masoretic Text,
suggesting that an ancestor of the Masoretic Text was indeed extant as early as
the 2nd century BCE. However, other texts, including many of those from Qumran,
differ substantially, indicating that the Masoretic Text was but one of a
diverse set of Biblical writings (Lane Fox 1991:99-106; Tov 1992:115). ¬ßAmong
the rejected books by both the Judaic and Catholic canons was found the Book of
Enoch, the Manual of Discipline or "Rule of the Community" (1QS) and "The War
of the Sons of Light Against the Sons of Darkness". (1QM). Some important
editions. There have been very many published editions of the Masoretic text;
this is a list of some of the most important.
