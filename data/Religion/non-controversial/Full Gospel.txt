Full Gospel The term Full Gospel is often used as a synonym for Pentecostalism,
a Protestant movement originating in the 19th century. Early Pentecostals saw
their teachings on baptism with the Holy Spirit, spiritual gifts, and divine
healing as a return to the doctrines and power of the Apostolic Age. Because of
this many early Pentecostals called their movement the Apostolic Faith or the
Full Gospel. This term has origins in the holiness movement. A. B. Simpson, the
founder of the Christian and Missionary Alliance, framed his core beliefs
around the "Fourfold Gospel", that Christ is Savior, Sanctifier, Healer, and
Soon Coming King. Many Pentecostals were influenced by Simpson and adopted his
Fourfold or "Foursquare" Gospel as an articulation of their beliefs. This term
is still used today in the name of the International Church of the Foursquare
Gospel. The term "Full Gospel" also refers to Romans 15,18-19, where Paul says:
"... to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed, through mighty signs and
wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round
about unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ."
