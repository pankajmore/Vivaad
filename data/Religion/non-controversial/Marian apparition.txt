Marian apparition A Marian apparition is an event in which someone believes the
Blessed Virgin Mary has supernaturally appeared to one or more people. They are
often named after the town where they were reported, or on the sobriquet given
to Mary on the occasion of the apparition. They have been interpreted in
religious terms as theophanies. Marian apparitions sometimes are reported to
recur at the same site over an extended period of time. In the majority of
Marian apparitions only a few people report having witnessed the apparition.
Exception to this include Zeitoun, and Assiut where thousands claimed to have
seen her over a period of time. Apparitions and appearances. The term
"appearance" has been used in different apparitions within a wide range of
contexts and experiences. And its use has been different with respect to Marian
apparitions and visions of Jesus Christ. In some apparitions such as Our Lady
of Lourdes or Our Lady of F√°tima an actual vision is reported, fully
resembling that of a person being present. In some of these reports the viewers
(at times children) do not initially report that they saw the Virgin Mary, but
that they saw ""a Lady"" (often but not always dressed in white) and had a
conversation with her. In these cases the viewers report experiences that
resemble the visual and verbal interaction with a person present at the site of
the apparition. In most cases, there are no clear indications as to the
auditory nature of the experience, i.e. whether the viewers heard the voices
via airwaves or an "interior" or subjective sense of communication. Yet, the
1973 messages of Our Lady of Akita, are due to Sister Agnes Katsuko Sasagawa
who had been totally deaf before 1973 (and remained deaf until 1982 when she
was cured during Sunday Mass as foretold in her messages), suggesting means of
communication other than airwaves. In some apparitions just an image is
reported, often with no verbal interaction, and no conversation. An example is
the reported apparitions at Our Lady of Assiut in which many people reported a
bright image atop a building, accompanied by photographs of the image. The
photographs at times suggest the silhouette of a statue of the Virgin Mary but
the images are usually subject to varying interpretations, and critics suggest
that they may just be due to various visual effects of unknown origin. However,
such "image-like" appearances are hardly ever reported for visions of Jesus and
Mary. In most cases these involve some form of reported communication. And
apparitions should be distinguished from interior locutions in which no visual
contact is claimed. In some cases of reported interior locutions such as those
of Father Stefano Gobbi a large amount of text is produced, but no visual
contact is claimed. Interior locutions usually do not include an auditory
component, but consist of inner voices. Interior locutions are generally not
classified as apparitions. Physical contact is hardly ever reported as part of
Marian apparitions, unlike in cases of interaction with Jesus Christ. In rare
cases a physical artifact is reported in apparitions. A well known example is
the image of Our Lady of Guadalupe, which is reported to have been miraculously
imprinted on the cloak of Saint Juan Diego. Catholic belief. According to the
doctrine of the Catholic Church, the era of public revelation ended with the
death of the last living Apostle. A Marian apparition, if deemed genuine by
Church authority, is treated as private revelation that may emphasize some
facet of the received public revelation for a specific purpose, but it can
never add anything new to the deposit of faith. The Church will confirm an
apparition as worthy of belief, but belief is never required by divine faith.
The Holy See has officially confirmed the apparitions at Guadalupe, Saint-
√âtienne-le-Laus, Paris (Rue du Bac, Miraculous Medal), La Salette, Lourdes,
F√°tima, Pontmain, Beauraing, and Banneux. As a historical pattern, Vatican
approval of apparitions seems to have followed general acceptance of a vision
by well over a century in most cases. According to Father Salvatore M. Perrella
of the Marianum Pontifical Institute in Rome, of the 295 reported apparitions
studied by the Holy See through the centuries only 12 have been approved, the
latest being the May 2008 approval of the 17th- and 18th-century apparitions of
Our Lady of Laus. Other apparitions continue to be approved at the local level,
e.g. the December, 2010 local approval of the 19th-century apparitions of Our
Lady of Good Help, the first recognized apparition in the United States. An
authentic apparition is believed not to be a subjective experience, but a real
and objective intervention of divine power. The purpose of such apparitions is
to recall and emphasize some aspect of the Christian message. The church states
that cures and other miraculous events are not the purpose of Marian
apparitions, but exist primarily to validate and draw attention to the message.
Apparitions of Mary are held as evidence of her continuing active presence in
the life of the church, through which she "cares for the brethren of her son
who still journey on earth." Not all claims of visitations are dealt with
favourably by the Roman Catholic Church. For example, claimed apparitions of
Our Lady, under the title of "Our Lady of the Roses, Mary, Help of Mothers",
Jesus Christ and various saints at Bayside, New York have not been condoned or
sanctioned in any way, nor those at the Necedah Shrine in Necedah, Wisconsin.
The behavior of Ms Veronica Lueken and Mary Ann Van Hoof, who claimed these
heavenly favors, was deemed not to compare favorably with the "quiet
pragmatism" of St. Bernadette Soubirous ‚Äî Church authorities are said to use
Bernadette as a model by which to judge all who purport to have visitations.
Indeed, both women seriously criticized the Roman Catholic Church hierarchy,
allegedly even harshly, and Mrs. Van Hoof is said to have subsequently left
Roman Catholicism for an independent local Old Catholic Church. Possibly the
best-known apparition sites are Lourdes and F√°tima Over sixty spontaneous
healings, out of thousands reported at the Lourdes Spring, have been classified
as "inexplicable" by the physicians of the Lourdes Bureau, a medical centre set
up by the Church in association with local medical institutes to assess
possible miracles. The Three Secrets of F√°tima received a great deal of
attention in the Catholic and secular press. Criteria for evaluating
apparitions. After this initial investigation, if the occurrence meets the
criteria, positive and negative, an initial cautionary permission can be
granted that states: "for the moment, there is nothing opposed to it". This
permits public participation in the devotion in regard to the alleged
apparition. Ultimately, a final judgment and determination needs to be given,
giving approval or condemnation of the event. Local diocese approval. If the
local bishop authorizes devotion inspired by an apparition to proceed based on
an initial assessment, that permission does not constitute formal approval,
which recognizes an event as being supernatural in origin. Such approval may
follow years or even centuries later. A recent example of such a delay is the
case of Our Lady of Laus, in which devotion was approved by the local diocese
in 1665, but obtained formal recognition as a supernatural event only in 2008.
Moreover, Marian apparitions often involve complications at the local diocese,
and a letter of approval or disapproval from a local bishop, does not
automatically signal approval or denial. A recent example is the apparitions of
Our Lady of Kibeho in the 1980s in Kibeho, Rwanda. In 1982 the teenagers who
saw the visions reported truly gruesome sights and said that the Virgin Mary
asked everyone to pray to prevent a terrible war. Some today regard the visions
as an ominous foreshadowing of the Rwandan Genocide of 1994, and particularly
in that specific location in 1995, where some teenagers died a decade after
their vision. The apparitions were accepted by the local bishop (accused by
many of complicity in the genocide himself), but have not been given final
approval by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. Apparitions and
statues. Marian apparitions are sometimes reported along with weeping statues
of the Virgin Mary. However, to date only one single example of a combined
weeping statue and apparition (namely Our Lady of Akita) has been approved by
the Vatican and the rest have usually been dismissed as hoaxes. Impact of
apparitions. A few cases can illustrate these items. Conversions and shrines.
By all accounts, when Juan Diego, age 57, reported the apparition of Our Lady
of Guadalupe on Tepeyac hill in Mexico in 1531, he did not receive a lot of
attention in Rome, since the Church was busy with the challenges of the
Protestant Reformation of 1521 to 1579 and perhaps very few Cardinals in Rome
had ever heard the details of Mexico and its environs. Yet, just as a large
number of people were leaving the Catholic Church in Europe as a result of the
Reformation, Our Lady of Guadalupe was instrumental in adding almost 8 million
people to the ranks of Catholics in the Americas between 1532 and 1538. The
number of Catholics in South America has grown significantly over the
centuries. Eventually with tens of millions of followers, Juan Diego had an
effect on Mariology in the Americas and beyond, and was eventually declared
venerable in 1987. Juan Diego was declared a saint in 2002. Furthermore, the
Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe on Tepeyac hill in Mexico is now the third
largest Catholic Church in the world, after Saint Peter's Basilica in Rome and
the Basilica of the National Shrine of Our Lady of Aparecida in Brazil. Recent
reported apparitions such as Medjugorje have also attracted a large following.
Societies and devotions. The Marian apparition of Our Lady of F√°tima on a
remote mountain top to three young Portuguese children in 1917 also seemed
fanciful and the local administrator initially jailed the children and
threatened that he would boil them one by one in a pot of oil. However, over
the years the effect of F√°tima has been undeniable. With over 25 million
registered Catholic members, the Blue Army of Our Lady of F√°tima (which was
approved by Pope Pius XII in 1947) is the largest Marian Society in the world.
And the message of F√°tima has inspired the spread of other devotions. An
example is Our Lady's Rosary Makers formed by Brother Sylvan Mattingly in 1949
with $25 to distribute free rosaries, based on his devotion to F√°tima. Our
Lady's Rosary Makers has since distributed hundreds of millions of free
rosaries to Catholic missions worldwide. Mariology. Marian apparitions such as
Our Lady of Lourdes (which promoted Immaculate Conception) have also influenced
the direction of Roman Catholic Mariology, as illustrated by the "ex cathedra"
exercise of Papal infallibility on the dogma of Immaculate Conception. This
also illustrated that unlike most Roman Catholic theology, which originates
from the upper levels of the Church, Mariology has quite often been driven from
the ground up by the tens of millions of Catholics with a special devotion to
the Blessed Virgin. As Marian apparitions create strong emotions among large
numbers of Roman Catholics, they lead to sensus fidelium. This strong response
among Catholics in turn influences the higher levels of the Roman Catholic
hierarchy as sensus fidei gains strength. The Vatican quotes in this context
the encyclical Fulgens Corona, where Pius XII supported such a faith. In
several Marian teachings, the "theology of the people" such as the immaculate
Conception, the profound and century-old sense of the faithful has taken
precedence over academic theology. Pilgrimages. Marian apparitions are also
responsible for tens of millions of Marian pilgrimages per year. About 5
million pilgrims visit Lourdes every year and within France only Paris has more
hotels than Lourdes. And about 10 million pilgrims visit Our Lady of Guadalupe
each year, where each mass can accommodate up to 40,000 people. Thus each
decade, just Lourdes and Guadalupe amount to over one hundred million Catholic
pilgrimages, based on Marian apparitions to two people on two remote hilltops.
The Sanctuary of Our Lady of F√°tima also attracts a large number of Roman
Catholics, and every year pilgrims fill the country road that leads to the
shrine with crowds that approach one million on May 13 and October 13, the
significant dates of Fatima apparitions. Overall, about four million pilgrims
visit the basilica every year. In Canada, millions of Americans and Canadians
have visited the national shrine of Our Lady of the Cape, in Cap-de-la-
Madeleine, Quebec, where the first pilgrimages began in 1888. Historical
feasts. A number of feasts based on historical traditions involving apparitions
are celebrated in the Roman Catholic Church. These apparitions do not
technically fall in the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith approved
category, since they generally predate the formation of the Congregation for
the Doctrine of the Faith in 1542. They are recognized based on the papal
declaration of the feast day rather than formal analysis by the Congregation
for the Doctrine of the Faith. Our Lady of the Pillar. In the year AD¬ 39,
according to tradition, the Virgin Mary appeared to Saint James the Great, in
Zaragoza, Spain. The vision is now called Our Lady of the Pillar and is the
only reported Marian apparition before her Assumption. The Basilica of Our Lady
of the Pillar was built in Zaragoza, Spain and a key piece of Roman Catholic
Marian art, the statue of "Our Lady of the Pillar", refers to this apparition.
Our Lady of the Snow. Our Lady of the Snow is based on a legend that during the
pontificate of Pope Liberius, during the night of August the 5th, snow fell on
the summit of the Esquiline Hill in Rome. Based on a vision that night, a
basilica was built in honour of Our Lady, on the spot that had been covered
with snow. The church built there is now the basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore,
and the feast was celebrated at that church for centuries on August 5 each
year. However, there was no mention of this alleged miracle in historical
records until a few hundred years later, not even by Pope Sixtus III in his
dedicatory inscription, and it may be that the legend has no historical basis.
However, in the 14th century the feast was extended to all the churches of Rome
and finally it was made a universal feast by Pope Pius V. Our Lady of
Walsingham. According to the tradition of Our Lady of Walsingham, the Virgin
Mary appeared in a vision to Richeldis de Faverches, a devout Saxon noblewoman,
in 1061 in Walsingham, England, instructing her to construct a shrine
resembling the place of the Annunciation. The shrine passed into the care of
the Canons Regular sometime between 1146 and 1174. Late in 1538, King Henry
VIII‚Äôs soldiers sacked the priory at Walsingham, killed two monks and
destroyed the shrine. In 1897 Pope Leo XIII re-established the restored 14th
century Slipper Chapel as a Roman Catholic shrine. The Holy House had been
rebuilt at the Catholic Church of the Annunciation at King's Lynn (Walsingham
was part of this Catholic parish in 1897). Today there are two shrines at
Walsingham: the Roman Catholic shrine centered on the Slipper Chapel and the
Holy House maintained by the Church of England. There are also two separate
feast days: September 24 in the Roman Catholic Church and October 15 in the
Anglican Communion. Our Lady of the Rosary. The apparition of Our Lady of the
Rosary is by tradition attributed to Saint Dominic in 1208 in the church of
Prouille, in France. According to the attribution, the Virgin Mary appeared to
Saint Dominic and introduced him to the rosary. Some sources suggest that Alan
de Rupe (rather than Saint Dominic) was the major influence on the rosary in
the 15th century, while other sources seek a middle ground to these two views.
For centuries, Dominicans became instrumental in spreading the rosary and
emphasizing the Catholic belief in the power of the rosary. In 1571 Pope Pius V
instituted "Our Lady of Victory" as an annual feast to commemorate the victory
of Lepanto, the victory being attributed to Our Lady. In 1969, Pope Paul VI
changed the name of the feast to Our Lady of the Rosary. Our Lady of Mount
Carmel. The Blessed Virgin Mary is said to have appeared to Saint Simon Stock,
who was Prior General of the Carmelite Order in the mid 13th century. The
earliest reference to the tradition of his Marian apparition, dating from the
late 14th century, states that "St. Simon was an Englishman, a man of great
holiness and devotion, who always in his prayers asked the Virgin to favor his
Order with some singular privilege. The Virgin appeared to him holding the
Brown Scapular in her hand saying, 'This is for you and yours a privilege; the
one who dies in it will be saved.'" A scapular is an apron-like garment that
forms part of the Carmelite religious habit, and in the original context the
Blessed Virgin Mary's promise was an assurance that religious who persevered in
their vocation would be saved; beginning in the latter half of the 16th century
the small devotional scapular became very popular as a sacramental. The
historicity of Saint Simon Stock's vision is disputed, and as a result today
neither the liturgy for the Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel (which originally
had no association with scapular devotion, but became strongly connected with
Saint Simon Stock's vision in the 17th century), nor that of Saint Simon Stock
make any reference to the vision of Mary or the scapular. The Brown Scapular
itself remains warmly approved and recommended by the Catholic Church. Various
devotional sources quote an interview with Lucia Santos in which she speaks
about the Brown Scapular, saying "Our Lady wants all to wear the Scapular",
especially when praying the Rosary, because "the "Rosary and Scapular" are
inseparable". Approved apparitions. A Roman Catholic approved Marian apparition
is one that has been examined by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith
either based on the criteria listed above (or internal procedures in place
before that) and has been granted approval either through the local Bishop
based on the direction of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith or
received a direct approval from the Holy See. Although a local bishop may
provide a preliminary assessment (and allow the devotion to proceed forward),
formal approval can only be provided after detailed analysis by the Holy See.
For instance, although the apparitions at Our Lady of Laus were recognized by
the local diocese in 1665, they received approval from the Congregation for the
Doctrine of the Faith centuries later, in 2008. However, a papal visit does not
amount to a formal approval. Some apparitions such as in Assiut, Egypt have
been approved by the Coptic Church and can be called "approved" but not Roman
Catholic approved. Approved by the Roman Catholic Church. Our Lady of
Guadalupe. The 1531 apparition of Our Lady of Guadalupe was reported by Saint
Juan Diego. He said he saw an early morning vision of the Virgin Mary in which
he was instructed to build an abbey on the Hill of Tepeyac in Mexico. The local
prelate did not believe his account and asked for a miraculous sign, which was
later provided as an icon of Our Lady of Guadalupe permanently imprinted on the
saint‚Äôs cloak where he had gathered roses. Over the years, Our Lady of
Guadalupe became a symbol of the Catholic faith in Mexico and the Mexican
diaspora. Our Lady of Laus. The apparitions of Our Lady of Laus between 1664
and 1718 in Saint-√âtienne-le-Laus, France to Beno√Æte Rencurel, a young
shepherdess are the first Marian apparitions approved in the 21st century by
the Roman Catholic Church. The apparitions were recognized by the diocese of
the Roman Catholic Church on September 18, 1665. They were approved by the
Vatican on May 5, 2008. Currently, the site where the apparitions took place
receives more than 120,000 pilgrims a year. Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal.
The vision of Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal is said to have appeared to
Saint Catherine Labour√© in 1830 in the convent of Rue du Bac, Paris. She
reported that one night in the chapel, the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared to her
and asked that a medallion be made to a design that she dictated. The lady
added that, "All who wear this medal will receive great graces." After spending
two years examining her claims, her priest eventually took the information to
his archbishop. The medal eventually produced came to be referred to as the
Miraculous Medal. The front of the medal displays a picture of the virgin as
she appeared to Catherine Labour√©. The design on the reverse includes the
letter M and a cross. Pope John Paul II used a slight variation of the reverse
image as his coat of arms, the Marian Cross. This is a plain cross with an M
underneath the right-hand bar, to signify the Blessed Virgin standing at the
foot of the Cross while Jesus was being crucified. Sister Justine Bisqueyburu
is said to have also had an apparition in 1840 within the same chapel at Rue du
Bac as Saint Catherine Labour√©. These visitations instituted the Green
Scapular, which involves a very simple devotion to the Immaculate Heart of Mary
and is associated with healing. The Green Scapular has its own association but
has not yet been approved by the Holy See and does not have an associated
confraternity. Our Lady of La Salette. The apparitions of Our Lady of La
Salette were reported in La Salette in France in 1846 by two shepherd children,
M√©lanie Calvat and Maximin Giraud, followed by numerous accounts of miraculous
healings. The Roman Catholic Church investigated the claims and found them
basically credible. However, in the late 19th century controversy surrounded
the claims of one of the seers, M√©lanie Calvat in a France hostile to
religion. Recent releases from the Vatican Secret Archives may have clarified
the situation to some extent, but some controversy still remains attached to
this apparition. Our Lady of Lourdes. In 1858 Saint Bernadette Soubirous was a
14-year-old shepherd girl who lived near the town of Lourdes in France. One day
she reported a vision of a miraculous Lady who identified Herself as "the
Immaculate Conception" in subsequent visions. In the second vision she was
asked to return again and she had 18 visions overall. According to Saint
Bernadette, the Lady held a string of Rosary beads and led Saint Bernadette to
the discovery of a buried spring, also requesting that the local priests build
a chapel at the site of the visions and lead holy processions there.
Eventually, a number of chapels and churches were built at Lourdes as the
Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes‚Äîwhich is now a major Catholic pilgrimage
site. One of these churches, the Basilica of St. Pius X can accommodate 25,000
people and was dedicated by the future Pope John XXIII when he was the Papal
Nuncio to France. Our Lady of Pontmain. The apparitions at Our Lady of
Pontmain, France also called Our Lady of Hope were reported in 1871 by a number
of young children. The final approval for the apparitions of Our Lady of Hope
was given in 1932 by Eugenio Cardinal Pacelli, who later became Pope Pius XII.
Our Lady of F√°tima. The visions of the Virgin Mary appearing to three shepherd
children at Our Lady of F√°tima in Portugal in 1917 were declared worthy of
belief by the Catholic Church in 1930. Five popes ‚Äî Pius XII, John XXIII,
Paul VI, John Paul II, and Benedict XVI ‚Äî have supported the F√°tima messages
as supernatural. John Paul II was particularly attached to F√°tima and credited
Our Lady of F√°tima with saving his life after he was shot in Rome on the Feast
Day of Our Lady of F√°tima in May 1981. He donated the bullet that wounded him
on that day to the Sanctuary of Our Lady of F√°tima. Benedict XVI, on May 13,
2010, prayed and gave the second Golden Rose to Our Lady of F√°tima and also
pronounced in front of more than 500,000 pilgrims a reference to the F√°tima
prophecy about the triumph of the Immaculate Heart of Mary. In 1925, eight
years after the F√°tima events, Sister L√∫cia reported another set of
apparitions, which became known as the Pontevedra apparitions. Our Lady of
Beauraing. The 33 apparitions of Our Lady of Beauraing were reported in Belgium
between November 1932 and January 1933 by five local children ranging in age
from 9 to 15 years. From 1933 to World War II, pilgrims flocked to the little
village of Beauraing. The final approbation for the apparition was granted on
July 2, 1949 under the authority of the Holy Office by the decree of Andre-
Marie Charue, Bishop of Namur, Belgium. These apparitions are also known as the
"Virgin of the Golden Heart". Our Lady of Banneux. The apparitions of Our Lady
of Banneux were reported by a young child, Mariette Beco a native of Banneux,
Belgium in the 1930s. They are also known as the Virgin of the Poor. The
apparitions were approved by the Roman Catholic Church in 1949. Beco reported
eight visions of the Blessed Virgin Mary between January 15 and March 2, 1933.
She reported seeing a Lady in White who declared herself the "Virgin of the
Poor" and told her: "Believe in me and I will believe in you". In one vision,
the Lady reportedly asked Mariette to drink from a small spring and later said
that the spring was for healing. Over time the site drew pilgrims. Today, the
small spring yields about 2,000 gallons of water a day with many reports of
miraculous healings. Our Lady of Akita. The apparitions of Our Lady of Akita
were reported in 1973 by Sister Agnes Katsuko Sasagawa in the remote area of
Yuzawadai, near the city of Akita in Japan. For several decades, Agnes Sasagawa
had encountered many health problems but her health reportedly improved after
drinking water from Lourdes. After going totally deaf, she went to live with
the nuns in the remoteness of Yuzawadai. In 1973 she reported apparitions of
the Virgin Mary, as well as stigmata and a weeping statue of the Virgin Mary
that continued to weep over the next six years on 101 occasions. According to
EWTN, up to November 2011 no ecclesiastical decree appears to exist from the
Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. However, some individuals, such as
former Ambassador of the Philippines to the Holy See, Mr. Howard Dee, have
stated that they were given private assurances by Cardinal Ratzinger of the
authenticity of Akita. "In any case, in keeping with the current norms, given
the absence of a repudiation of Bp. Ito's decision by his successors, or by
higher authority, the events of Akita continue to have ecclesiastical
approval.". Approved by a local Church ordinary. The apparitions of Our Lady of
Cuapa began on April 15, 1980, in San Francisco de Cuapa, Nicaragua. The Virgin
Mary repeatedly appeared to Bernardo Martinez, a sacristan, and according to
the visionary this began when he saw a strange light emanating from a statue of
the Virgin Mary in the parish church. In May, when walking through the fields,
he claimed that he saw a vision of the Virgin Mary, who encouraged him to pray
the rosary and promote peace saying: ""Make Peace. Don't ask Our Lord for peace
because, if you do not make it, there will be no peace"". At this time,
Nicaragua was going through a civil war. The Sandinista government was facing
armed opposition from the Contras. Bernardo Martinez claimed that the Blessed
Virgin Mary ordered him to burn bad books, which was interpreted to mean
Marxist books. The auxiliary Bishop of Managua complied with this request.
Sandinista commentators responded by describing the apparition as 'Saint Mary
of the Contras', 'Our Lady of Oliver North and Our Lady of Cuapa. On November
13, 1982, the Bishop of Juigalpa released an official statement as Bishop of
the area where the apparitions took place assuring the faithful of the
authenticity of the events. The apparitions at San Francisco de Cuapa are thus
among the few Marian apparitions approved by the Catholic Church in the
twentieth century. In 2005, Silvio Sirias wrote a novel, ""Bernardo and the
Virgin"" based on these events. The apparitions of Our Lady of Kibeho began on
November 28, 1981 in the African college of Kibeho, Rwanda. The Virgin Mary
repeatedly appeared to Alphonsine Mumureke, Nathalie Mukamazimpaka, and Marie
Claire Mukangango. The apparition identified herself in the native Rwandan
dialect as ‚ÄúNyina wa Jambo", ( "Mother of the Word"), which is synonymous
with "Mother of God.‚Äù The apparitions communicated various messages to the
schoolchildren, urging the people to love each other, and warning of an
apocalyptic vision of Rwanda descending into violence and hatred, foretelling
the 1994 Rwandan Genocide. In 2001 the Holy See released the declaration of
Bishop Misago of Gikongoro approving the apparitions. The Marian sanctuary at
Kibeho was named "Shrine of Our Lady of Sorrows" in 1992, two years before the
genocide. An estimated 500,000 pilgrims visit the site every year. The
apparitions of Our Lady of Good Success began on 2 February 1594 at the
Conceptionist Convent in Quito, Ecuador. The Virgin Mary repeatedly appeared to
Venerable Mother Mariana de Jesus Torres, identifying herself as 'Our Lady of
Good Success'. The apparition requested that a statue be made in her likeness
and made several predictions concerning a crisis in the church specifically a
fall in vocations, a lack of availability of the sacraments and a fall in moral
standards in the 20th century. The apparitions were approved by the local
Bishop, Salvador de Riber on 2 February 1611. In 1991 The Vatican granted the
canonical coronation of our Lady of Good Success as 'Queen of Quito' after
being petitioned by the Archbishop of Quito. The apparitions of Our Lady of
Good Help were reported by Adele Brise in 1859. In December 2010, Bishop David
L. Ricken of Green Bay, Wisconsin approved the apparition as worthy of belief,
as the first Marian apparition approved in the United States at the local
level. In Robinsonville (now called Champion) WI, a young Belgian immigrant
woman named Adele Brise was walking through a wooded area when she saw a
beautiful woman standing between a maple and a hemlock tree. She saw the lady
again on her way to Mass, and walked past her again. After Mass she told her
priest about the apparition, and he told her to ask the Lady "In God's name,
who are you and what do you want of me?" When Adele walked past the spot again,
the Lady was there, and Adele asked what she was told by the priest. The Lady
replied, "I am the Queen of Heaven who prays for the conversion of sinners."
She gave Adele the mission to teach the children of the area their Catechism,
which Adele did faithfully. Soon after, Adele's father built a small chapel
between the trees, and later two more churches were built on the spot before
the present brick church, built in 1942. The apparitions,attributed to Our Lady
of Good Help, were approved on December 8, 2010, by Bishop David Ricken of the
Diocese of Green Bay. Approved by the Coptic Orthodox Church. Some apparitions
have been approved by authorities of the Coptic Orthodox Church. For an
apparition to be approved, the Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church sends an
official delegation made of bishops and priests, all of whom must witness the
apparition and document miracles associated with it. Our Lady of Zeitoun. Our
Lady of Zeitoun was a mass Marian apparition that occurred in the Zeitoun
district of Cairo, Egypt, over a period of 2‚Äì3 years beginning on April 2,
1968, in the period after the six day war. It was reportedly witnessed by many
thousands of people, including Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, and
captured by newspaper photographers and Egyptian television. According to
witnesses, the Virgin Mary appeared in different forms over the Coptic Orthodox
Church of Saint Mary at Zeitoun for a period of 2‚Äì3 years. The apparitions
lasted from a few minutes up to several hours and were sometimes accompanied by
dove-shaped luminous bodies. The sick and blind are said to have been cured,
and many people converted to Christianity as a result. In a statement dated May
4, 1968, the Patriarchate of Cairo and Kyrillos VI stated that they considered
the events at Zeitoun as valid, and that they had received many reports of
immediate healings during the reported apparitions. Our Lady of Assiut. The
apparitions of Our Lady of Assiut were also mass apparitions in Assiut, Egypt
during 2000 and 2001 and many thousands of witnesses produced photographs of
them, which were reprinted in several newspapers. The reports state that during
mass, pictures hung on the wall inside the altar, which show St Mary with a
dove above her started to illuminate first, then the light from the dove in the
pictures started to flow down. The lights thereafter appeared above the church
as well and were seen by thousands of people. The Coptic church approved of the
apparitions. Approved by the Anglican Communion. Our Lady of Lourdes. The
Anglican Communion has officially recognized the apparition of Our Lady of
Lourdes and has built an Anglican Marian Shrine on the location, relatively
close the Roman Catholic shrine. In September 2008 Rowan Williams, the
Archbishop of Canterbury made a pilgrimage to Lourdes and preached at the
shrine. Our Lady of Walsingham. Father Alfred Hope Patten, appointed as the
Church of England Vicar of Walsingham in 1921, ignited Anglican interest in the
pre-Reformation pilgrimage. It was his idea to create a new statue of Our Lady
of Walsingham based on the image depicted on the seal of the medieval priory.
In 1922 the statue was set up in the Parish Church of Saint Mary and regular
pilgrimage devotion followed. From the first night that the statue was placed
there, people gathered around it to pray, asking Mary to join her prayers with
theirs. In the United States the National Shrine to Our Lady of Walsingham for
the Episcopal Church is located in Grace Episcopal Church (Sheboygan,
Wisconsin). Our Lady of Walsingham is remembered by Roman Catholics on 24
September and by Anglicans on 15 October. A parish of the Pastoral Provision
named for Our Lady of Walsingham is in Houston, Texas. A Western Rite
Antiochian Orthodox parish named for Our Lady of Walsingham is in Mesquite,
Texas. Our Lady of Yankalilla. In August 1994 an image was said to have become
visible on a wall behind the altar of a 137-year-old Anglican stone church in
Yankalilla, South Australia. The image was interpreted as an image of the
Virgin Mary's face, shoulders, and abdomen. The image supposedly depicts Mary
holding the crucified Christ in the manner of a piet√ . Her gaze is directed
toward the tabernacle below, which contains the consecrated eucharistic bread.
It is also claimed that an image of a rose appeared at the bottom of the larger
image. In December 1996, the Bishop of The Murray blessed the church as "The
Shrine of Our Lady of Yankalilla" and it has become a popular pilgrimage site
for Australian Anglicans. Apparitions with no or undocumented approval. A list
of some notable reports of Marian apparitions is provided below. The
apparitions discussed here do not have approval, and only those apparitions
listed and explained in the sections above have received either Roman Catholic
or Coptic approval, and the others shown in the table here are simply based on
legend, reports of individuals or are still awaiting approval. There are
hundreds of other reported apparitions around the world without major
references or church investigations and they can not be included in this
section, due to their lack of notability. A number of claimed apparitions sites
still not fully approved continue to gather pilgrims and become the site of
major Marian basilicas. The apparitions at these sites are often the subject of
legends. An example is Our Lady of Walsingham where according to legend the
Blessed Virgin appeared in a vision to a noblewoman in 1061 and her son built a
simple wooden structure there that later became an abbey. No details of the
content of vision have been preserved, but pilgrims continued to arrive at
Walsingham for centuries until 1st Earl of Essex destroyed it in 1538. The 1490
apparition reported by Italian peasant Benedetto Pareto regarding Our Lady of
Guardia is somewhat similar, but has a happier ending. Pareto also reported
that the Virgin Mary appeared to him and asked him to build a church atop the
mountain. Pareto at first refused, saying that he was just a poor man, but he
eventually built a small wooden structure, which in time gathered many
pilgrims. The Shrine of Our Lady of Guardia is now a thriving basilica atop
Mount Figogna, near Genoa Italy. Some major Marian basilicas and traditions are
based on legends that do not involve any specific apparitions, but sacred
objects that are assumed to have been associated with apparitions. The key
example is the Basilica of the National Shrine of Our Lady of Aparecida in
Aparecida, Brazil. It is the second-largest Catholic place of worship in the
world, second only to St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City, and the largest
Marian Church in the world, receiving over 6 million pilgrims a year. There is
no specific vision or apparition associated with Our Lady of Aparecida, and it
is based on a simple wooden statue of the Blessed Virgin (found by fishermen)
that over the centuries drew millions of pilgrims, based on its reported
healing powers. The festivals surrounding Our Lady of Chiquinquir√° in
Venezuela are based on a piece of wood that, according to legend, grew luminous
with the image of the Blessed Virgin in 1709. In the case of Our Lady of Kazan,
legend holds that the Blessed Virgin revealed the location of the precious icon
to a 10 year old girl in 1579. The Basilica of Our Lady of Good Health in
Velankanni, Tamil Nadu in southern India does, however, have a legend that
involves a number of apparitions. There is no historical record of the
apparition of Our Lady of Good Health but the oral tradition suggests that
there was an apparition to a Hindu boy in mid 16th century and later Portuguese
sailors were saved by another apparition. Also another one major Marian
apparitions in India is of Korattymuthy at Koratty in Kerala. Similarly, the
legend Our Lady of La Vang is based on an apparition to a group of Vietnamese
Catholics in the rain forest in 1798, and the site of a basilica. The Basilica
of our Our Lady of Siluva in Siluva, Lithuania is also based on a legend of an
apparition to four children in 1608, and houses a famous painting (perhaps
based on Salus Populi Romani) called "Our Lady of Siluva", usually considered
Lithuania's greatest treasure. Although both She Shan Basilica in Shanghai,
China and Our Lady of China in Donglu, near Beijing, were popular pilgrimage
sites at one time, with the arrest and imprisonment of the Catholic bishops in
the 1950s by the communists and with the establishment of the Chinese Patriotic
Catholic Association against the Vatican, these pilgrimages have slowed down.
The Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lichen, the largest church in Poland (and the 11th
largest in the world) is based on legends on the Virgin Mary appearing to
different people in the Lichen area in the early 19th century. The Sanctuary of
Our Lady of Knock in Ireland is based on a reported appearance of the Virgin
Mary along with Jesus Christ and other saints in Ireland in 1879. Between 1941
and 1988, Felisa Sistiaga reported several apparitions of the Blessed Virgin
Mary as Our Lady of Sorrows in Umbe, near Bilbao, Spain. The messages left by
Our Lady were very similar to that given in the Marian apparitions of
Garabandal. In 1945, two children - Marcelina Barroso Exp√≥sito and Afra
Br√≠gido Blanco - reported several apparitions of the Blessed Virgin Mary as
Our Lady of Sorrows near La Codosera, in the province of Badajoz, Extremadura,
Spain. A few years later, the Bishop of Badajoz gave permission for the
construction of a large Marian shrine in the place of the apparitions and one
of the visionaries, Marcelina, became a cloistered nun. On June 4, 1947, seven-
year-old Angela Volpini was grazing cattle near her hometown of Casanova
Staffora, near Oltrep√≤ Pavese in northwest Italy, when she felt someone
embrace her from behind and lift her up. Assuming it was her aunt, she turned
around and saw "a woman's face -- beautiful, sweet and unknown." The
apparitions occurred on the fourth day of every month for ten years, and many
were filmed. Ms. Volpini's father supported her, but her mother, while
believing in the apparitions, feared for the girl's life. The local priest,
Father Gianni Baget Bozzo, believed the child and formed a lifelong friendship
with her. He often compared the apparitions to those of Our Lady of Lourdes. On
his death May 8, 2009, he left one-sixth of his fortune to Volpini. People who
believe in Ms. Volpini's experiences formed a devotional organization called
"Nova Cana"‚Äîthe name invented by Ms. Volpini herself‚Äîto commemorate the
events. Between 1958 and 1962, Mathew Lashut reported several apparitions of
the Virgin Mary on a forest near Turzovka, a town in north-western Slovakia.
This apparition was predicted to come about as ‚Äúa second Lourdes" or "the
Lourdes of Slovakia‚Äù by the German Catholic mystic and stigmatic Therese
Neumann. The reported apparitions of Our Lady of Kibeho in 1982 included
exceptionally long and dramatic visions lasting eight hours. According to the
teenage visionaries, in 1982 the Virgin Mary asked everyone to pray to prevent
a terrible war. A war and genocide eventually took place at the same location
in 1995 and claimed the lives of some of visionaries. The apparitions were
accepted by the local Roman Catholic bishop, Bishop Misago, but have not been
given final approval by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. The
bishop himself went on trial for nine months on charges of involvement in the
genocide but was not convicted. The reported apparitions of Our Lady of America
in 1956 in Rome City, Indiana, did receive a positive response from the local
bishop and have been Canonically-approved by several Archbishops and Bishops,
but no decision has been rendered with regard to the supernatural origin and
characters of the reported apparitions. Pilgrims arrive daily to pray and offer
their devotion in the Our Lady Mother of Mercy Chapel, which sits on the
grounds of what is now Sylvan Springs. The fact that pilgrims continue arriving
at a reported apparition site and the fact that church figures a continent away
may be sympathetic towards the apparition does not mean that approval has been
obtained. For instance, although the Village of Pellevoisin in France does
receive pilgrims, and there is a small shrine of Our Lady of Pellevoisin in St.
Paul's church in New York, according to the University of Dayton Marian
Library, archbishops of Bourges have never pronounced on the subject of
Pellevoisin and have been very reserved on the topic. However, various
independent (and colorful) "lists of apparitions" websites declare Pellevoisin
as approved, with no clear reference for the approval. The apparitions reported
between 1945 and 1959 by Ida Peerdeman in Amsterdam as The Lady of all Nations
include a short prayer called the Amsterdam Blessing. In May 2002, Bishop Jozef
Marianus Punt of Haarlem-Amsterdam issued a letter that declared this
apparition as having a supernatural origin. However, this apparition has not
been officially approved by the Holy See, and has approval only at the local
bishop level. Between 1968 and 1976, a young boy named Jes√∫s Jos√© reported
several apparitions of the Blessed Virgin Mary as Our Lady of Graces in Onuva,
near La Puebla del R√≠o, province of Seville, Spain. In the last apparition,
the message from heaven explains that "¬´Onuva means: Land of Mercy, Land of
Mercy!¬ª". Between 1990 and 1995, two young girls - Ivetka Korcakova (born
1978) and Katka Ceselkova (born 1977) - reported several apparitions of the
Blessed Virgin Mary under the title of "The Immaculate Purity" on the Zvir
Mountain, in Litmanov√°, a village of northern Slovakia. During these religious
events, the visionaries were accompanied by many priests and now there is a
Marian shrine on the place of apparitions. Many people, not only Slovaks, make
pilgrimages to this location to celebrate the Divine Liturgy and obtain water
from a holy stream. Since 1992, some reported apparitions of the Blessed Virgin
Mary under the title of "Virgin of the Eucharist" in Manduria, south of Italy,
are also receiving many attention worldwide, in particular by the Catholic
youth. Debora Marasco, the visionary, founded a Catholic Movement for the young
people named "Manduria for Young People". A similar phenomenon with Catholic
youth is occurring near S√£o Marcos da Serra, in Algarve, Portugal, were other
reported apparitions of the Blessed Virgin Mary under the title of "Mother of
Goodness" attract, since 1999, many young people and priests to the place of
apparitions. The Holy See has never officially approved or disapproved these
apparitions. Several apparition related sites on the internet exist, often with
detailed messages that sound pious, accompanied by testimonies from local
witnesses, and even local priests and bishops. However, these representations
do not always amount to authenticity or Vatican approval. An example is the
website for the apparitions of "Our Lady of the Eucharist" in Rome since the
year 2000. The website for "Our Lady of the Eucharist" includes a clear letter
and a photo from Bishop Claudio Gatti who approved the apparition. Yet a more
detailed search of the same website produces a letter from the Congregation for
the Doctrine of the Faith reducing the said Bishop to lay rank following a
series of meetings at the Vatican on this and other matters (e.g. the Bishop's
position of marriage for priests). The Bishop now uses the title "ordained by
God" rather than Catholic Bishop. At Soufanieh, a suburb of Damascus a series
of apparitions have reportedly been observed between 1982 and 2004, without any
approval to date. As a general pattern, in most cases, formal Vatican approval
for apparitions usually requires at least a century, even if the local diocese
issues a preliminary letter permitting devotions. For instance, Our Lady of
Laus was recognized by the local bishop in 1665 but was only granted approval
by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in 2008. As current examples,
Our Lady of Kibeho have received recognition from the local diocese, but there
has been no formal approval from the Holy See. The same with the 1973
apparitions of Our Lady of Akita. Some purported Marian apparitions initiated
events that led to schism of Catholics forming their own independent churches
as a result of Rome's disapproval of them. Notable examples include the
revelations of Feliksa Koz≈Çowska between 1893 and 1918, which led to the
founding of the Mariavite and the Old Catholic Mariavite churches. Others
include the Palmarian Catholic Church, which began after a series of purported
apparitions in Palmar de Troya, while Fraternite Notre Dame, a Traditionalist
Catholic church traces its origins to apparitions that were reported in
Frechou, France, and is led by Bishop Jean Marie Kozik who was consecrated by
Vietnamese Archbishop Ngo Dinh Thuc. An apparition of Our Lady at Batim is the
supposed appearance by the Virgin Mary in the compound of Igreja de S√£o Sim√£o
e Judas (Church of Saint Simon and Jude), Batim-Ganxim in Goa. The first
sighing is purported to have been made by Iveta Gomes on the 24th September,
1994. Others have since claimed to have seen the Virgin Mary, as well as other
miracles, at this location. Though the apparition has no Episcopal approval,
the Church has not raised any objection to the gathering of people at the site,
in expression of their faith. Apparitions condemned by church authorities. Not
all reports of visions and apparitions are taken seriously by church
authorities. For instance, the messages reported by Catalina Rivas were later
found to correspond to exact pages of books written by others, and published
instructional literature for Catholic seminarians. Claimed apparitions and
miracles at Holy Love Ministries in Elyria, Ohio were denounced by local Bishop
Richard Lennon as "not supernatural in origin" and "forbid members of the
clergy of any ecclesiastical jurisdiction" to celebrate the Sacraments on the
site. He also declared "that the Confraternity of the United Hearts of Jesus
and Mary is not an approved association of the Christian faithful in the
Diocese of Cleveland and may not legitimately use the name 'Catholic' or
represent itself as a Catholic group.". The reported Garabandal apparitions
from 1961 to 1965 were examined by the local Bishop and were declared as not
having evidence of being of supernatural origin. However the apparitions were
not declared as a hoax and the possibility of future approval was left open. At
Garabandal, an apparition by Saint Michael, the Archangel was reported first,
announcing the arrival of the Virgin Mary (under the title of Our Lady of Mount
Carmel). Among recent visions, the reported apparitions of The Virgin Mary to
six children in Meƒëugorje in 1981 have received much attention despite
official condemnation by the local Bishop. The Our Lady of Meƒëugorje messages
are published and distributed worldwide and often emphasize five key elements:
Daily prayer of the Holy Rosary, Fasting on Wednesdays and Fridays, Daily
reading of the Bible, Monthly Confessions and Holy Communion. On March 17,
2010, the Vatican announced it was beginning a formal investigation of the
apparitions at Medugorje. Cardinal Camillo Ruini is to head the commission that
will study the matter. The visions at Medjugorje have been condemned by Bishop
Pavao ≈Ωaniƒá. The Bishop affirms his complete certainty that Our Lady did not
appear in Medjugorje. The Commission to investigate the apparitions has
continually underlined the theological and disciplinary difficulties posed by
the events and the messages of Medjugorje. The Holy See had not overturned the
ruling by the Bishop at this time. In 1991, the Zadar document declaired, "On
the basis of the investigations so far it can not be affirmed that one is
dealing with supernatural apparitions and revelations." Purported locutions
received by the late Veronica Lueken from 1968-1994 were declared invalid by
Bishop Francis Mugavero, then Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn.
Similarly, reports of "Our Lady of Surbiton" claiming that the Virgin Mary
appeared every day under a pine tree in England were flatly rejected by the
Vatican as a fraud. Some reported apparitions attract negative publicity at the
location of the apparition. For instance, the latter parts of the reported
messages from Gianna Talone were disapproved by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese
of Baltimore and a group of Emmitsburg, Maryland residents started a campaign
against Talone and accused her of running a cult. To date, the Holy See has let
the Talone matter rest at the local level of the archdiocese. Criticism. Some
Protestant Christians and non-Christians regard claims of Marian apparitions as
being hallucinations encouraged by superstition, and occasionally simply as
deliberate hoaxes to attract attention. Many such apparitions are reported in
economically depressed areas, attracting many pilgrims who bring trade and
money into the region. For instance, some sources dispute the very existence of
Saint Juan Diego. Some spontaneous healings reported at apparition sites such
as Lourdes are also disputed by some scientists. Other scientists have claimed
that a handful of unexplained cures have occurred; the Lourdes Medical Bureau
has recorded sixty "inexplicable" healings that match its requirements. Critics
maintain that some other healings are incomplete, leaving the sufferer with
disabilities or chronic illness, and that other claimed healings are likely to
be the relatively rare but unmiraculous spontaneous remission of illness or
injury. Such remissions might be expected to occur in a few of the large
numbers of ill (and perhaps credulous) people who visit such sites. That
viewpoint is debated by religious people and by some in the medical profession.
The Lourdes Medical Bureau claims that it will not review cases of claimed
healing involving illnesses known sometimes to go into remission by themselves,
or incomplete healings, or those that take place gradually. although it counts
cases of tumors, which are remissible. Gallery of apparition-based Marian
churches. Marian apparitions, and sacred objects related to them, have led to
the construction of some of the largest Roman Catholic Marian churches.
