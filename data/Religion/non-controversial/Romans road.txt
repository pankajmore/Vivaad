Epistle to the Romans The Epistle to the Romans, often shortened to Romans, is
the sixth book in the New Testament. Biblical scholars agree that it was
composed by the Apostle Paul to explain that salvation is offered through the
gospel of Jesus Christ. It is by far the longest of the Pauline epistles, and
is considered his "most important theological legacy". General presentation.
According to Jesuit scholar Joseph Fitzmyer, the book, "overwhelms the reader
by the density and sublimity of the topic with which it deals, the gospel of
the justification and salvation of Jew and Greek alike by the grace of God
through faith in Jesus Christ, revealing the uprightness and love of God the
father." N. T. Wright notes that Romans is Authorship. According to traditional
scholarly consensus, Paul authored the Epistle to the Romans. Only few scholars
have argued against Paul's authorship. Dating. The letter was most probably
written while Paul was in Roman Corinth, and probably while he was staying in
the house of Gaius and transcribed by Tertius his amanuensis. There are a
number of reasons Corinth is most plausible. Paul was about to travel to
Jerusalem on writing the letter, which matches Acts where it is reported that
Paul stayed for three months in Greece. This probably implies Corinth as it was
the location of Paul‚Äôs greatest missionary success in Greece. Additionally
Phoebe was a deacon of the church in Cenchreae, a port to the east of Corinth,
and would have been able to convey the letter to Rome after passing through
Corinth and taking a ship from Corinth‚Äôs west port. Erastus, mentioned in ,
also lived in Corinth being the city's commissioner for public works and city
treasurer at various times, again indicating that the letter was written in
Corinth. The precise time at which it was written is not mentioned in the
epistle, but it was obviously written when the collection for Jerusalem had
been assembled and Paul was about to "go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the
saints", that is, at the close of his second visit to Greece, during the winter
preceding his last visit to that city. The majority of scholars writing on
Romans propose the letter was written in late 55/early 56 or late 56/early 57.
Early 58 and early 55 both have some support, while German New Testament
scholar Gerd L√ºdemann argues for a date as early as 51/52 (or 54/55) following
on from Knox who proposed 53/54. L√ºdemann is the only serious challenge to the
consensus of mid to late 50s. Context of Romans in Paul's life. For ten years
before writing the letter (approx. 47-57), Paul had traveled around the
territories bordering the Aegean Sea evangelising. Churches had been planted in
the Roman provinces of Galatia, Macedonia, Achaia and Asia. Paul, considering
his task complete, wanted to preach the gospel in Spain, where he would not
"build upon another man‚Äôs foundation". This allowed him to visit Rome on the
way, a long time ambition of his. The letter to the Romans, in part, prepares
them and gives reasons for his visit. In addition to Paul‚Äôs geographic
location, his religious views are important. First, Paul was a Hellenistic Jew
with a Pharisaic background (see Gamaliel), integral to his identity, see Paul
of Tarsus and Judaism for details. His concern for his people is one part of
the dialogue and runs throughout the letter. Second, the other side of the
dialogue is Paul‚Äôs conversion and calling to follow Christ in the early 30s.
The Church in Rome. At this time, the Jews made up a substantial number in
Rome, and their synagogues, frequented by many, enabled the Gentiles to become
acquainted with the story of Jesus of Nazareth. Consequently, a church composed
of both Jews and Gentiles was formed at Rome. According to Irenaeus, a 2nd
century Church Father, the church at Rome was founded directly by the apostles
Peter and Paul. However, many modern scholars disagree with Irenaeus, holding
that while little is known of the circumstances of the church's founding, it
was not founded by Paul. Many of the brethren went out to meet Paul on his
approach to Rome. There is evidence that Christians were then in Rome in
considerable numbers and probably had more than one place of meeting. Jews were
expelled from Rome because of Christian disturbances around AD 49 by the edict
of Claudius. The conflict developed because Jewish Christians and Jews argued
with one another over the validity of Jesus as the Messiah, see also Rejection
of Jesus. Both Jews and Jewish Christians were expelled as a result of their
infighting. The majority of people left in the Christian church at Rome would
have been Gentile Christians. These gentile churches developed along a
different trajectory from the Christian circles that grew out of Jewish
synagogues. Claudius died around the year AD 54, and his successor, Emperor
Nero, allowed the Jews back into Rome, but then, after the Great Fire of Rome
of 64, persecuted the Christians. Gentile Christians may have developed a
dislike of or looked down on Jews (see also Antisemitism and Responsibility for
the death of Jesus), because they theologically rationalized that Jews were no
longer God's people. Fitzmyer argues that with the return of the Jews to Rome
in 54 new conflict arose between the Gentile Christians and the Jewish
Christians who had formerly been expelled. Historians question whether the
Roman government distinguished between Christians and Jews prior to Nerva's
modification of the Fiscus Judaicus in 96 (Jews paid the tax, Christians did
not). The Roman church would have to accept that the gospel was for the "Jew
first and also to the Greek." Style. A. Deissmann, "Light from the Ancient
East, 2nd ed" (London: Hodder & Stoughton, 1927), 218, 220 Joseph Fitzmyer
argues, from evidence put forth by Stirewalt, that the style of Romans is an
"essay-letter." Philip Melanchthon, a writer during the Reformation, suggested
that Romans was "caput et summa universae doctrinae christianae" ("a summary of
all Christian doctrine"). While some scholars attempt to suggest, like
Melanchthon, that it is a type of theological treatise, this view largely
ignores chapters 14 and 15 of Romans. There are also many "noteworthy elements"
missing from Romans that are included in other areas of the Pauline corpus. The
breakdown of Romans as a treatise began with F.C. Baur in 1836 when he
suggested "this letter had to be interpreted according to the historical
circumstances in which Paul wrote it." Paul sometimes uses a style of writing
common in his time called a "diatribe". He appears to be responding to a
"heckler", and the letter is structured as a series of arguments. In the flow
of the letter, Paul shifts his arguments, sometimes addressing the Jewish
members of the church, sometimes the Gentile membership and sometimes the
church as a whole. Purposes of writing. The main purpose of the epistle to the
Romans is given by Paul in , where he reveals that he is set apart by God for
the purpose of preaching the Gospel, which he explains. He wishes to impart to
the Roman readers a gift of encouragement and assurance in all that God has
freely given them (see ; ). To review the current scholarly viewpoints on the
purpose of Romans, along with a bibliography, see "Dictionary of Paul and His
Letters". For a 16th century "Lollard" reformer view, reference can be made to
the work of Tyndale's New Testament, edited by David Daniel (Yale University
Press, London and New Haven, 1989), 223 Content. This essay-letter composed by
Paul was written to a specific audience at a specific time; to understand it,
the situations of both Paul and the recipients must be understood. Introduction
(1:1‚Äì15). The introduction provides some general notes about Paul. He
introduces here and introductory notes about the gospel he wishes to preach to
the church at Rome. Jesus' human line stems from David. Paul, however, does not
limit his ministry to Jews. Paul's goal is that the gentiles would also hear
the gospel. He commends the Romans for their faith. Paul also speaks of the
past obstacles that have blocked his coming to Rome earlier. Unashamed (1:
16‚Äì17). Paul's announcement that he is not "ashamed" ("epaisc√∫nomai") of his
gospel because it holds power ("d√∫namis"). These two verses form a backdrop
for the rest of the book. First, we note that Paul is unashamed of his love for
this gospel that he preaches about Jesus Christ. He also notes that he is
speaking to the "Jew first." There is significance to this, but much of it is
scholarly conjecture as the relationship of Paul of Tarsus and Judaism is still
debated. We are hard-pressed to find an answer to such a question without
knowing more about the audience in question. Wayne Brindle argues, based on
Paul's former writings against the Judaizers in Galatians and 2¬ Corinthians,
that rumors had probably spread about Paul totally negating the Jewish
existence in a Christian world, see also Antinomianism in the New Testament and
Supersessionism. Paul may have used the "Jew first" approach to counter such a
view. The judgment of God (1:18‚Äì32). Paul now begins into the main thrust of
his letter. He begins by suggesting that humans have taken up ungodliness and
wickedness for which there will be wrath from God. People have taken God's
invisible image and made him into an idol. Paul draws heavily here from the
Wisdom of Solomon. He condemns unnatural sexual behavior and warns that such
behavior will result in a depraved body and mind and says that people who do
such things (including murder and wickedness ) are worthy of death. Paul stands
firmly against the idol worship system which was common in Rome. He also goes
on to say that a righteousness from God has made itself known apart from the
law, to which the law and prophets testify, and this righteousness from God
comes through faith in Jesus to all who believe. () Paul's warning of
hypocrites (2:1‚Äì4). On the traditional Protestant interpretation, Paul here
calls out Jews who are condemning others for not following the law when they
themselves are also not following the law. Stanley Stowers, however, has argued
on rhetorical grounds that Paul is in these verses not addressing a Jew at all
but rather an easily recognizable caricature of the typical boastful person
(·ΩÅ ·ºÄŒªŒ±Œ∂œâŒΩ). Stowers writes, "There is absolutely no justification for
reading as Paul's attack on 'the hypocrisy of the Jew.' No one in the first
century would have identified "ho alazon" with Judaism. That popular
interpretation depends upon anachronistically reading later Christian
characterizations of Jews as 'hypocritical Pharisees'". See also Anti-Judaism.
Assurance of salvation (5‚Äì11). In chapters five through eight, Paul argues
that believers can be assured of their hope in salvation, having been freed
from the bondage of sin. Paul teaches that through faith, the faithful have
been joined with Jesus and freed from sin. Believers should celebrate in the
assurance of salvation. This promise is open to everyone since everyone has
sinned, save the one who paid for all of them. In Paul addresses the
faithfulness of God to Israel, where he says that God has been faithful to His
promise. Paul hopes that all of Israel will come to realize the truth since he
himself was also an Israelite, and had in the past been a persecutor of Early
Christians. In Paul talks about how the nation of Israel has been cast away,
and the conditions under which Israel will be God's chosen nation again: when
Israel returns to its faith, sets aside its unbelief. Transformation of
believers (12‚Äì15:13). In , Paul says that humans are under the law while we
live: "Know ye not‚Ä¶that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he
liveth?" However, Jesus' death on the cross makes believers dead to the law (,
"Wherefore, my brethren, ye are also become dead to the law by the body of
Christ"), according to an antinomistic interpretation. From chapter 12 through
the first part of chapter 15, Paul outlines how the Gospel transforms believers
and the behaviour that results from such a transformation. He goes on to
describe how believers should live: not under the law, but under the grace of
God, see Law and grace. If believers live in obedience to God, study the
scriptures, (and share them with others) and love everybody, believers are not
going to need to sin. As Paul says in , "love (·ºÄŒ≥Œ¨œÄŒ∑) worketh no ill to
his neighbor: therefore love is the fulfilling of law". The fragment in dealing
with obedience to earthly powers is considered by some, for example James
Kallas, to be a gloss incorporated later. See also the Great Commandment () and
Christianity and politics. Concluding verses (15:14‚Äì16:27). The concluding
verses contain a description of his travel plans, personal greetings and
salutations. One-third of the twenty-one Christians identified in the greetings
are women, some of whom played an important role in the early church at Rome.
Additionally, none of these Christians answer to the name Peter, although
according to the Catholic storyline, he had been ruling as Pope in Rome for
about 25 years. Possibly related was the Incident at Antioch between Paul and
Peter. Hermeneutics. Catholic interpretation. But by your hard and impenitent
heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath when God's
righteous judgment will be revealed. For he will render to every man according
to his works: to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor
and immortality, he will give eternal life; but for those who are factious and
do not obey the truth, but obey wickedness, there will be wrath and fury. There
will be tribulation and distress for every human being who does evil, the Jew
first and also the Greek, but glory and honor and peace for every one who does
good, the Jew first and also the Greek. For God shows no partiality. The gospel
warned us, "Be on the watch for the last day, the day when the Son of Man will
come," because it will spell disaster for those it finds secure as they are now
‚Äì secure for the wrong reasons, I mean, secure in the pleasures of this
world, when they ought to be secure only when they have "dominated this world's
lusts". The apostle certainly prepares us for that future life in words of
which I also reminded you on that occasion. Let us not expect security while we
are on pilgrimage. When we do find ourselves wanting it, what we are looking
for is bodily sluggishness rather than personal security. Protestant
interpretation. They also point out that in , Paul says that God will reward
those who follow the law and then goes on to say that "no one" follows the law
perfectly (see also Sermon on the Mount: Interpretation) Martin Luther
described Paul's letter to the Romans as the "most important piece in the New
Testament. It is purest Gospel. It is well worth a Christian's while not only
to memorize it word for word but also to occupy himself with it daily, as
though it were the daily bread of the soul". Luther controversially added the
word "alone" ("allein" in German) to so that it read: "thus, we hold, then,
that man is justified without doing the works of the law, "alone" through
faith". but Luther defended his translation by maintaining that the adverb
"alone" was required both by idiomatic German and Paul's intended meaning. This
is a ""literalist view"" rather than an literal view of the Bible. The "Romans
Road" refers to a set of scriptures from Romans that Christian evangelists use
to present a clear and simple case for personal salvation for each person. They
are: Romans 3:23, Romans 6:23, Romans 5:8, Romans 10:9-10, Romans 10:13, and
Revelation 3:20. Romans has been at the forefront of several major movements in
Protestantism. Martin Luther's lectures on Romans in 1515‚Äì1516 probably
coincided with the development of his criticism of Roman Catholicism which led
to the 95 Theses of 1517. In 1738, while hearing Luther's Preface to the
Epistle to the Romans read at St. Botolph Church on Aldersgate Street in
London, John Wesley famously felt his heart "strangely warmed", a conversion
experience which is often seen as the beginning of Methodism. In 1919 Karl
Barth's commentary on Romans, "The Epistle to the Romans", was the publication
which is widely seen as the beginning of neo-orthodoxy. External links.
