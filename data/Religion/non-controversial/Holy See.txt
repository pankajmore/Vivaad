Holy See The Holy See (, ) is the episcopal jurisdiction of the Catholic Church
in Rome. The primacy of Rome makes its bishop the worldwide leader of the
church, commonly known as the Pope. Since Rome is the preeminent episcopal see
of the Church, it contains the central government of the church, including
various agencies essential to administration. Diplomatically, the Holy See acts
and speaks for the whole Roman Catholic Church. It is also recognized by other
subjects of international law as a sovereign entity, headed by the Pope, with
which diplomatic relations can be maintained." Often incorrectly referred to as
"the Vatican", the Holy See is not the same entity as the Vatican City State,
which came into existence only in 1929; the Holy See, the episcopal see of
Rome, dates back to early Christian times. Ambassadors are officially
accredited not to the Vatican City State but to "the Holy See", and papal
representatives to states and international organizations are recognized as
representing the Holy See, not the Vatican City State. Though all episcopal
sees may be considered "holy", the expression "the Holy See" (without further
specification) is normally used in international relations (and in the canon
law of the Roman Catholic Church) to refer to the See of Rome viewed as the
central government of the Roman Catholic Church. The British Foreign and
Commonwealth Office speaks of Vatican City as the "capital" of the Holy See,
although it compares the legal personality of the Holy See to that of the Crown
in Christian monarchies and declares that the Holy See and the state of Vatican
City are two international identities. It also distinguishes between the
employees of the Holy See (2,750 working in the Roman Curia with another 333
working in the Holy See's diplomatic missions abroad) and the 1,909 employees
of the state. The British Ambassador to the Holy See uses more precise
language, saying that the Holy See "is not the same as the Vatican City State.
â€¦ (It) is the universal government of the Catholic Church and "operates from"
the Vatican City State." This agrees exactly with the expression used by the
website of the United States Department of State, in giving information on both
the Holy See and the Vatican City State: it too says that the Holy See
"operates from the Vatican City State". Organisation. The Pope governs the
Catholic Church through the Roman Curia. The Roman Curia consists of a complex
of offices that administer church affairs at the highest level, including the
Secretariat of State, nine Congregations, three Tribunals, eleven Pontifical
Councils, and seven Pontifical Commissions. The Secretariat of State, under the
Cardinal Secretary of State, directs and coordinates the Curia. The incumbent,
Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, is the See's equivalent of a prime minister.
Archbishop Dominique Mamberti, Secretary of the Section for Relations with
States of the Secretariat of State, acts as the Holy See's minister of foreign
affairs. Bertone and Mamberti were named in their respective roles by Pope
Benedict XVI in September 2006. The Secretariat of State is the only body of
the Curia that is situated within Vatican City. The others are in buildings in
different parts of Rome that have extraterritorial rights similar to those of
embassies. Among the most active of the major Curial institutions are the
Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, which oversees the Catholic
Church's doctrine; the Congregation for Bishops, which coordinates the
appointment of bishops worldwide; the Congregation for the Evangelization of
Peoples, which oversees all missionary activities; and the Pontifical Council
for Justice and Peace, which deals with international peace and social issues.
Three tribunals exercise judicial power. The Roman Rota handles normal judicial
appeals, the most numerous being those that concern alleged nullity of
marriage. The Apostolic Signatura is the supreme appellate and administrative
court concerning decisions even of the Roman Rota and administrative decisions
of ecclesiastical superiors (bishops and superiors of religious institutes),
such as closing a parish or removing someone from office. It also oversees the
work of other ecclesiastical tribunals at all levels. The Apostolic
Penitentiary deals not with external judgments or decrees, but with matters of
conscience, granting absolutions from censures, dispensations, commutations,
validations, condonations, and other favours; it also grants indulgences. The
Prefecture for the Economic Affairs of the Holy See coordinates the finances of
the Holy See departments and supervises the administration of all offices,
whatever be their degree of autonomy, that manage these finances. The most
important of these is the Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See.
The Prefecture of the Papal Household is responsible for the organization of
the papal household, audiences, and ceremonies (apart from the strictly
liturgical part). The Holy See does not dissolve upon a Pope's death or
resignation. It instead operates under a different set of laws "sede vacante".
During this interregnum, the heads of the dicasteries of the Roman Curia (such
as the prefects of congregations) cease immediately to hold office, the only
exceptions being the Major Penitentiary, who continues his important role
regarding absolutions and dispensations, and the Camerlengo of the Holy Roman
Church, who administers the temporalities ("i.e.", properties and finances) of
the See of St. Peter during this period. The government of the See, and
therefore of the Catholic Church, then falls to the College of Cardinals. Canon
law prohibits the College and the Camerlengo from introducing any innovations
or novelties in the government of the Church during this period. In 2001, the
Holy See had a revenue of 422.098Â billion Italian lire (about 202Â million USD
at the time), and a net income of 17.720Â billion Italian lire (about
8Â million USD). Status in international law. The Holy See has been recognised,
both in state practise and in the writing of modern legal scholars, as a
subject of public international law, with rights and duties analogous to those
of States. Although the Holy See, as distinct from the Vatican City State, does
not fulfil the long-established criteria in international law of
statehoodâ€”having a permanent population, a defined territory, a stable
government and the capacity to enter into relations with other statesâ€”its
possession of full legal personality in international law is shown by the fact
that it maintains diplomatic relations with 179 states, that it is a "member-
state" in various intergovernmental international organizations, and that it
is: "respected by the international community of sovereign States and treated
as a subject of international law having the capacity to engage in diplomatic
relations and to enter into binding agreements with one, several, or many
states under international law that are largely geared to establish and
preserving peace in the world." Diplomacy. Since medieval times the episcopal
see of Rome has been recognized as a sovereign entity. The Holy See (not the
State of Vatican City) maintains formal diplomatic relations with 179 sovereign
states, and also with the European Union, and the Sovereign Military Order of
Malta, as well as having relations of a special character with the Palestine
Liberation Organization; 69 of the diplomatic missions accredited to the Holy
See are situated in Rome. The Holy See maintains 180 permanent diplomatic
missions abroad, of which 74 are non-residential, so that many of its 106
concrete missions are accredited to two or more countries or international
organizations. The diplomatic activities of the Holy See are directed by the
Secretariat of State (headed by the Cardinal Secretary of State), through the
Section for Relations with States. There are 15 internationally recognized
states with which the Holy See does not have relations. The Holy See is the
only European subject of international law that has official diplomatic
relations with the Republic of China (Taiwan). The Holy See is a member of
various International organizations and groups including the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), International Telecommunication Union, the
Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), the Organization
for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The Holy See is also a permanent observer in
various international organizations, including the United Nations General
Assembly, the Council of Europe, UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization), the World Trade Organization (WTO), and the Food
and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Military and police. Though, like various
European powers, earlier Popes recruited Swiss mercenaries as part of an army,
the Pontifical Swiss Guard was founded by Pope Julius II on 22 January 1506 as
the personal bodyguard of the Pope and continues to fulfil that function. It is
listed in the Annuario Pontificio under "Holy See", not under "State of Vatican
City". At the end of 2005, the Guard had 134 members. Recruitment is arranged
by a special agreement between the Holy See and Switzerland. All recruits must
be Catholic, unmarried males with Swiss citizenship who have completed their
basic training with the Swiss Army with certificates of good conduct, be
between the ages of 19 and 30, and be at least 175Â cm (5Â ft 9 in) in height.
Members are armed with small arms and the traditional halberd (also called the
Swiss voulge), and trained in bodyguarding tactics. Relationship with the
Vatican City and other territories. The Holy See participates as an observer in
AU, Arab League, Council of Europe, OAS, IOM, and in the UN and its agencies
FAO, ILO, UNCTAD, UNEP, UNESCO, UN-HABITAT, UNHCR, UNIDO, UNWTO, WFP, WHO,
WIPO. It participates as a guest in NAM, and as a full member in IAEA, OPCW,
OSCE. Although the Holy See is closely associated with the Vatican City, the
independent territory over which the Holy See is sovereign, the two entities
are separate and distinct. After the Italian takeover of the Papal States in
1870, the Holy See had no territorial sovereignty. In spite of some uncertainty
among jurists as to whether it could continue to act as an independent
personality in international matters, the Holy See continued in fact to
exercise the right to send and receive diplomatic representatives, maintaining
relations with states that included the major powers of Russia, Prussia and
Austria-Hungary. Where, in accordance with the decision of the 1815 Congress of
Vienna, the Nuncio was not only a member of the Diplomatic Corps but its Dean,
this arrangement continued to be accepted by the other ambassadors. In the
course of the 59 years during which the Holy See held no territorial
sovereignty, the number of states that had diplomatic relations with it, which
had been reduced to 16, actually increased to 29. The State of the Vatican City
was created by the Lateran Treaty in 1929 to "ensure the absolute and visible
independence of the Holy See" and "to guarantee to it an indisputable
sovereignty in international affairs" (quotations from the treaty). Archbishop
Jean-Louis Tauran, the Holy See's former Secretary for Relations with States,
said that the Vatican City is a "minuscule support-state that guarantees the
spiritual freedom of the Pope with the minimum territory". The Holy See, not
the Vatican City, maintains diplomatic relations with states. Foreign embassies
are accredited to the Holy See, not to the Vatican City, and it is the Holy See
that establishes treaties and concordats with other sovereign entities. When
necessary, the Holy See will enter a treaty on behalf of the Vatican City.
Under the terms of the Lateran Treaty, the Holy See has extraterritorial
authority over 23 sites in Rome and five Italian sites outside of Rome,
including the Pontifical Palace at Castel Gandolfo. The same authority is
extended under international law over the Apostolic Nunciature of the Holy See
in a foreign country. Coat of arms. As indicated in Coats of arms of the Holy
See and Vatican City, the difference between the two coats of arms is that the
arms of the Holy See have the gold key in bend and the silver key in bend
sinister (as also in the sede vacante coat of arms and in the external
ornaments of the papal coats of arms of individual popes), while the reversed
arrangement of the keys was chosen for the arms of the newly founded Vatican
City State in 1929. "Holy See" and "Apostolic See". Every episcopal see is
considered holy. In Greek, the adjective "holy" or "sacred" () is constantly
applied to all such sees as a matter of course. In the West, the adjective is
not commonly added, but it does form part of an official title of two sees: as
well as Rome, the Bishopric of Mainz (the former Archbishopric of Mainz), which
was also of electoral and primatial rank, bears the title of "the Holy See of
Mainz" (Latin: "Sancta Sedes Moguntina"). The term "see" comes from the Latin
word "sedes", meaning "seat", which refers to the Episcopal throne (cathedra).
The term "Apostolic See" can refer to any see founded by one of the Apostles,
but, when used with the definite article, it is used in the Catholic Church to
refer specifically to the see of the Bishop of Rome, whom that Church sees as
successor of Saint Peter, the Prince of the Apostles.
