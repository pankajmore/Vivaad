Siddur A siddur (; plural ×¡×“×•×¨×™× siddurim) is a Jewish prayer book,
containing a set order of daily prayers. This article discusses how some of
these prayers evolved, and how the "siddur", as it is known today has
developed. A separate article, Jewish prayer, discusses the prayers that appear
in the "siddur", and when they are said. History of the siddur. The earliest
parts of Jewish prayer book are the "Shema Yisrael" ("Hear O Israel")
(Deuteronomy 6:4 "et seq"), and the Priestly Blessing (Numbers 6:24-26), which
are in the Torah. A set of eighteen (currently nineteen) blessings called the
"Shemoneh Esreh" or the "Amidah" (Hebrew, "standing "), is traditionally
ascribed to the Great Assembly in the time of Ezra, at the end of the Biblical
period. The name "Shemoneh Esreh", literally "eighteen", is an historical
anachronism, since it now contains nineteen blessings. It was only near the end
of the Second Temple period that the eighteen prayers of the weekday Amidah
became standardized. Even at that time their precise wording and order was not
yet fixed, and varied from locale to locale. Many modern scholars believe that
parts of the Amidah came from the Hebrew apocryphal work Ben Sira. According to
the Talmud, soon after the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem a formal
version of the Amidah was adopted at a rabbinical council in Yavne, under the
leadership of Rabban Gamaliel II and his colleagues. However, the precise
wording was still left open. The order, general ideas, opening and closing
lines were fixed. Most of the wording was left to the individual reader. It was
not until several centuries later that the prayers began to be formally fixed.
By the Middle Ages the texts of the prayers were nearly fixed, and in the form
in which they are still used today. The siddur was printed by Soncino in Italy
as early as 1486, though a siddur was first mass-distributed only in 1865 . The
siddur began appearing in the vernacular as early as 1538. The first -
unauthorized - English translation, by Gamaliel ben Pedahzur (a pseudonym),
appeared in London in 1738; a different translation was released in the United
States in 1837. Creating the siddur. Readings from the Torah (five books of
Moses) and the Nevi'im ("Prophets") form part of the prayer services. To this
framework various Jewish sages added, from time to time, various prayers, and,
for festivals especially, numerous hymns. The earliest existing codification of
the prayerbook was drawn up by Rav Amram Gaon of Sura, Babylon, about 850 CE.
Half a century later Rav Saadia Gaon, also of Sura, composed a siddur, in which
the rubrical matter is in Arabic. These were the basis of Simcha ben Samuel's
Machzor Vitry (11th century France), which was based on the ideas of his
teacher, Rashi. Another formulation of the prayers was that appended by
Maimonides to the laws of prayer in his Mishneh Torah: this forms the basis of
the Yemenite liturgy, and has had some influence on other rites. From this
point forward all Jewish prayerbooks had the same basic order and contents. Two
authoritative versions of the Ashkenazi siddur were those of Shabbetai Sofer in
the 16th century and Seligman Baer in the 19th century; siddurim have also been
published reflecting the views of Jacob Emden and the Vilna Gaon. Different
Jewish rites. There are differences among, amongst others, the Sephardic
(including Spanish and Portuguese), Teimani (Yemenite), Chasidic, Ashkenazic
(German-Polish), BenÃ© Roma or Italkim and Romaniote (Greek, once extending to
Turkey and perhaps the southern Italian peninsula) liturgies. Most of these are
slight differences in the wording of the prayers; for instance, Oriental
Sephardic and some Hasidic prayer books state "×—× × ×• ×××ª×š ×—×›××”
×‘×™× ×” ×•×“×¢×ª", "Graciously bestow upon us from You wisdom ("á¸¥ochmah"),
understanding ("binah") and knowledge ("daat")", in allusion to the Kabbalistic
sefirot of those names, while the Nusach Ashkenaz, as well as Western Sephardic
and other Hasidic versions retain the older wording "×—× × ×• ×××ª×š ×“×¢×”
×‘×™× ×” ×•×”×©×›×œ", "Graciously bestow upon us from You knowledge,
understanding, and reason". In some cases, however, the order of the
preparation for the Amidah is drastically different, reflecting the different
halakhic and kabbalistic formulae that the various scholars relied on in
assembling their siddurim, as well as the minhagim, or customs, or their
locales. Some forms of the Sephardi rite are considered to be very overtly
kabbalistic, depending on how far they reflect the ritual of Isaac Luria. This
is partly because the Tetragrammaton frequently appears with varying vowel
points beneath the letters (unpronounced, but to be meditated upon) and
different Names of God appear in small print within the final hei (×”) of the
Tetragrammaton. In some editions, there is a Psalm in the preparations for the
Amidah that is printed in the outline of a menorah, and the worshipper
meditates on this shape as he recites the psalm. The Ashkenazi rite is more
common than the Sephardi rite in America. While Nusach Ashkenaz does contain
some kabbalistic elements, such as acrostics and allusions to the sefirot ("To
You, God, is the greatness and the might [gevurah, and the glory longevity
[netzach..." etc.), these are not easily seen unless the reader is already
initiated. It is notable that although many other traditions avoid using the
poem "Anim Zemiroth" on the Sabbath, for fear that its holiness would be less
appreciated due to the frequency of the Sabbath, the poem is usually sung by
Ashkenazi congregations before concluding the Sabbath Musaf service with the
daily psalm. The ark is opened for the duration of the song. Hasidim, though
usually ethnically Ashkenazi, usually use liturgies with varying degrees of
Sephardic influence, such as Nusach Sefard and Nusach Ari, in order to follow
the order of the prayers set by Rabbi Isaac Luria, often called "Ari HaKadosh",
or "The Holy Lion". Although the Ari himself was born Ashkenazi, he borrowed
many elements from Sephardi and other traditions, since he felt that they
followed Kabbalah and Halacha more faithfully. The Ari did not publish any
siddur, but orally transmitted his particular usages to his students with
interpretations and certain meditations. Many siddurim containing some form of
the Sephardic rite together with the usages of the Ari were published, both by
actual Sephardic communities and for the use of Hasidim and other Ashkenazim
interested in Kabbalah. In 1803, Rabbi Schneur Zalman of Liadi compiled an
authoritative siddur from the sixty siddurim that he checked for compliance
with Hebrew grammar, Jewish law, and Kabbalah: this is what is known today as
the "Nusach Ari", and is used by Lubavitch Hasidim. Those that use Nusach HaAri
claim that it is an all-encompassing nusach that is valid for any Jew, no
matter what his ancestral tribe or identity, a view attributed to the Maggid of
Mezeritch. The Mahzor of each rite is distinguished by hymns ("piyyutim")
composed by authors ("payyetanim"). The most important writers are Yose ben
Yoseh, probably in the 6th century, chiefly known for his compositions for Yom
Kippur; Eleazar Kalir, the founder of the payyetanic style, perhaps in the 7th
century; Saadia Gaon; and the Spanish school, consisting of Joseph ibn Abitur
(died in 970), ibn Gabirol, Isaac Gayyath, Moses ibn Ezra, Abraham ibn Ezra and
Judah ha-Levi, Moses ben Nahman (Nahmanides) and Isaac Luria. In the case of
Nusach HaAri, however, many of these High Holiday piyyutim are absent: the
older piyyutim were not present in the Sephardic rite, on which Nusach HaAri
was based, and the followers of the Ari removed the piyyutim composed by the
Spanish school. Complete versus weekday siddurim. Some siddurim have only
prayers for weekdays; others have prayers for weekdays and Shabbat (Jewish
Sabbath). Many have prayers for weekdays, Shabbat, and the three Biblical
festivals, Sukkot (the feast of Tabernacles), Shavuot (the feast of weeks) and
Pesach (Passover). The latter are referred to as a "Siddur Shalem" ("complete
siddur"). Variations and additions on holidays. There are many additional
liturgical variations and additions to the siddur for the "Yamim Noraim" (The
"Days of Awe"; High Holy Days, i.e. "Rosh HaShanah" and "Yom Kippur"). As such,
a special siddur has developed for just this period, known as a "mahzor" (also:
"machzor"). The "mahzor" contains not only the basic liturgy, but also many
"piyutim", Hebrew liturgical poems. Sometimes the term "mahzor" is also used
for the prayer books for the three pilgrim festivals, Pesach, Shavuot and
Sukkot. Popular siddurim. Below are listed many popular siddurim used by
