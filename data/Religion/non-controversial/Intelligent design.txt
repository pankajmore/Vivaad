Intelligent design Intelligent design (ID) is a form of creationism promulgated
by the Discovery Institute. The Institute defines it as the proposition that
"certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an
intelligent cause, not an undirected process such as natural selection." It is
a contemporary adaptation of the traditional teleological argument for the
existence of God, presented by its advocates as "an evidence-based scientific
theory about life's origins" rather than "a religious-based idea". The leading
proponents of intelligent design are associated with the Discovery Institute, a
politically conservative think tank, and believe the designer to be the
Christian deity. ID seeks to redefine science in a fundamental way that would
invoke supernatural explanations, an approach its proponents describe as
theistic realism or theistic science. It puts forward a number of arguments,
the most prominent of which are irreducible complexity and specified
complexity, in support of the existence of a designer. The scientific community
rejects the extension of science to include supernatural explanations in favor
of continued acceptance of methodological naturalism, and has rejected both
irreducible complexity and specified complexity for a wide range of conceptual
and factual flaws. The vast majority of the scientific community labels
intelligent design as pseudoscience and identifies it as a religious, rather
than scientific, viewpoint. It is rejected by mainstream science because it
lacks empirical support, supplies no tentative hypotheses, and resolves to
describe natural history in terms of scientifically untestable supernatural
causes. Intelligent design was developed by a group of American creationists
who revised their argument in the creation–evolution controversy to
circumvent court rulings such as the United States Supreme Court "Edwards v.
Aguillard" ruling, which barred the teaching of "Creation Science" in public
schools as breaching the separation of church and state. The first publication
of the phrase "intelligent design" in its present use as an alternative term
for creationism was in "Of Pandas and People", a 1989 textbook intended for
high-school biology classes. From the mid-1990s, intelligent design proponents
were supported by the Discovery Institute, which, together with its Center for
Science and Culture, planned and funded the "intelligent design movement". They
advocated inclusion of intelligent design in public school biology curricula,
leading to the 2005 "Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District" trial, where
U.S. District Judge John E. Jones III ruled that intelligent design is not
science, that it "cannot uncouple itself from its creationist, and thus
religious, antecedents", and that the school district's promotion of it
therefore violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S.
Constitution. History. Origin of the concept. The teleological argument, also
known as the design argument, is one of three basic religious arguments for the
existence of God which have been advanced for centuries (the others being the
ontological argument and the cosmological argument). In the 13th century Thomas
Aquinas argued that natural things act to achieve the best result, and as they
cannot do this without intelligence, an intelligent being must exist, setting
the goal and providing direction, and this being is God. The version formulated
in 1802 by the theologian William Paley used the watchmaker analogy to argue
that complexity and adaptation in nature demonstrated God's benevolent and
perfect design, for the good of humans. Paley's natural theology strongly
influenced scientists of the time, including Charles Darwin, who began with the
assumption that God had designed nature and were open to a deistic
interpretation that this design was implemented by laws. While Darwin's natural
selection explained complexity and adaptation without the need for a designer,
he was still inclined to think that everything resulted from designed laws, .
by which Nature's God shaped life. Intelligent design has Paley's religious
argument from design at its centre, but unlike Paley's openness to deistic
design through God given laws, the point of intelligent design is to seek
scientific confirmation of repeated miraculous interventions in the history of
life. By 1910 evolution was not a topic of major religious controversy in
America, but in the 1920s Fundamentalist Christianity engaged in the
Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy took up opposition to evolution, and
effectively suspended teaching of evolution in U.S. public schools. In the
1960s, after evolution was reintroduced into the curriculum, Young Earth
creationists promoted Creation Science as "an alternative scientific
explanation of the world in which we live", which frequently invoked the design
argument to explain complexity in nature. These explanations prefigured the
intelligent arguments of irreducible complexity, even featuring the bacterial
flagellum. Attempts to introduce this in schools led to court rulings that
Creation Science is religious in nature, and thus cannot be taught in public
school science classrooms. Intelligent design is also presented as science
invoking Paley's religious argument from design. It shares other arguments with
Creation Science but differs in avoiding overt literal Biblical references such
as the age of the Earth and Noah's Flood. Philosopher Barbara Forrest writes
that the intelligent design movement began in 1984 with the publication by Jon
A. Buell's the Foundation for Thought and Ethics of "The Mystery of Life's
Origin" by Charles B. Thaxton, a chemist and creationist. Thaxton held a
conference in 1988, "Sources of Information Content in DNA", which attracted
creationists such as Stephen C. Meyer. In March 1986, a review by Meyer used
information theory to suggest that messages transmitted by DNA in the cell show
"specified complexity" specified by intelligence, and must have originated with
an intelligent agent. In November of that year Thaxton described his reasoning
as a more sophisticated form of Paley's argument from design. At the "Sources
of Information Content in DNA" conference in 1988 he said that his intelligent
cause view was compatible with both metaphysical naturalism and
supernaturalism. Intelligent design avoids identifying or naming the
intelligent designer—it merely states that one (or more) must exist—but
leaders of the movement have said the designer is the Christian God. While
intelligent design proponents have pointed out examples, they have failed to
show that these usages had any influence on those who instigated the
intelligent design movement. The phrase did appear in explicitly creationist
writings such as "The Natural Limits to Biological Change" published in 1984 by
Lester and Bohlin. The creationist author A. E. Wilder-Smith has been cited as
an influence by intelligent design proponents, and in a 1968 publication he
argued that the mammary glands in whales could not have arisen by chance
mutations, but were more plausibly the work of "an intelligent nipple
designer". However, the first place that the term was systematically used,
defined in a glossary and claimed to be other than creationism was in the 1989
textbook "Of Pandas and People". "Of Pandas and People". The modern use of the
words "intelligent design" as a term intended to describe a field of inquiry
began after the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in the case of
"Edwards v. Aguillard" (1987) that creationism is unconstitutional in public
school science curricula. A Discovery Institute report says that Charles
Thaxton, editor of "Of Pandas and People", had picked the phrase up from a NASA
scientist, and thought "That's just what I need, it's a good engineering term".
In drafts of the book over one hundred uses of the root word "creation", such
as "creationism" and "Creation Science", were changed, almost without
exception, to "intelligent design", while "creationists" was changed to "design
proponents" or, in one instance, "cdesign proponentsists". and in December
decided to use the label "intelligent design" for his new creationist movement.
Stephen C. Meyer was at the conference, and later recalled that "the term came
up". "Of Pandas and People" was published in 1989, and was the first book to
make frequent use of the phrases "intelligent design", "design proponents", and
"design theory", thus representing the beginning of the modern "intelligent
design" movement. "Intelligent design" was the most prominent of around fifteen
new terms it introduced as a new lexicon of creationist terminology to oppose
evolution without using religious language. It was the first place where the
phrase "intelligent design" appeared in its present use, as stated both by its
publisher Jon Buell, and by William A. Dembski in his expert witness report.
The National Center for Science Education has criticized the book for
presenting all of the basic arguments of intelligent design proponents and
being actively promoted for use in public schools before any research had been
done to support these arguments. Although presented as a scientific textbook,
Philosopher of science Michael Ruse considers the contents "worthless and
dishonest". An ACLU lawyer described it as a political tool aimed at students
who did not "know science or understand the controversy over evolution and
creationism." One of the authors of the science framework used by California
Schools, Kevin Padian, condemned it for its "sub-text", "intolerance for honest
science" and "incompetence". Concepts. Irreducible complexity. The term
"irreducible complexity" was introduced by biochemist Michael Behe in his 1996
book "Darwin's Black Box", though he had already described the concept in his
contributions to the 1993 revised edition of "Of Pandas and People". Behe
defines it as "a single system which is composed of several well-matched
interacting parts that contribute to the basic function, wherein the removal of
any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning". Behe
uses the analogy of a mousetrap to illustrate this concept. A mousetrap
consists of several interacting pieces—the base, the catch, the spring and
the hammer—all of which must be in place for the mousetrap to work. Removal
of any one piece destroys the function of the mousetrap. Intelligent design
advocates assert that natural selection could not create irreducibly complex
systems, because the selectable function is present only when all parts are
assembled. Behe argued that irreducibly complex biological mechanisms include
the bacterial flagellum of "E. coli", the blood clotting cascade, cilia, and
the adaptive immune system. Critics point out that the irreducible complexity
argument assumes that the necessary parts of a system have always been
necessary and therefore could not have been added sequentially. They argue that
something that is at first merely advantageous can later become necessary as
other components change. Furthermore, they argue, evolution often proceeds by
altering preexisting parts or by removing them from a system, rather than by
adding them. This is sometimes called the "scaffolding objection" by an analogy
with scaffolding, which can support an "irreducibly complex" building until it
is complete and able to stand on its own. Behe has acknowledged using "sloppy
prose", and that his "argument against Darwinism does not add up to a logical
proof". Irreducible complexity has remained a popular argument among advocates
of intelligent design; in the Dover trial, the court held that "Professor
Behe's claim for irreducible complexity has been refuted in peer-reviewed
research papers and has been rejected by the scientific community at large".
Specified complexity. In 1986 Charles Thaxton, a physical chemist and
creationist, used the term "specified complexity" from information theory when
claiming that messages transmitted by DNA in the cell were specified by
intelligence, and must have originated with an intelligent agent. The
intelligent design concept of "specified complexity" was developed in the 1990s
by mathematician, philosopher, and theologian William Dembski. Dembski,
Research Professor of Philosophy and Director of the Center for Cultural
Engagement at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, states that when
something exhibits specified complexity (i.e., is both complex and "specified",
simultaneously), one can infer that it was produced by an intelligent cause
(i.e., that it was designed) rather than being the result of natural processes.
He provides the following examples: "A single letter of the alphabet is
specified without being complex. A long sentence of random letters is complex
without being specified. A Shakespearean sonnet is both complex and specified".
He states that details of living things can be similarly characterized,
especially the "patterns" of molecular sequences in functional biological
molecules such as DNA. Dembski defines complex specified information (CSI) as
anything with a less than 1 in 10150 chance of occurring by (natural) chance.
Critics say that this renders the argument a tautology: complex specified
information cannot occur naturally because Dembski has defined it thus, so the
real question becomes whether or not CSI actually exists in nature. The
conceptual soundness of Dembski's specified complexity/CSI argument has been
widely discredited by the scientific and mathematical communities. Specified
complexity has yet to be shown to have wide applications in other fields, as
Dembski asserts. John Wilkins and Wesley Elsberry characterize Dembski's
"explanatory filter" as "eliminative", because it eliminates explanations
sequentially: first regularity, then chance, finally defaulting to design. They
argue that this procedure is flawed as a model for scientific inference because
the asymmetric way it treats the different possible explanations renders it
prone to making false conclusions. Richard Dawkins, another critic of
intelligent design, argues in "The God Delusion" that allowing for an
intelligent designer to account for unlikely complexity only postpones the
problem, as such a designer would need to be at least as complex. Other
scientists have argued that evolution through selection is better able to
explain the observed complexity, as is evident from the use of selective
evolution to design certain electronic, aeronautic and automotive systems that
are considered problems too complex for human "intelligent designers". Fine-
tuned Universe. Intelligent design proponents have also occasionally appealed
to broader teleological arguments outside of biology, most notably an argument
based on the fine-tuning of universal constants that make matter and life
possible and which are argued not to be solely attributable to chance. These
include the values of fundamental physical constants, the relative strength of
nuclear forces, electromagnetism, and gravity between fundamental particles, as
well as the ratios of masses of such particles. Intelligent design proponent
and Center for Science and Culture fellow Guillermo Gonzalez argues that if any
of these values were even slightly different, the universe would be
dramatically different, making it impossible for many chemical elements and
features of the Universe, such as galaxies, to form. Thus, proponents argue, an
intelligent designer of life was needed to ensure that the requisite features
were present to achieve that particular outcome. Scientists have generally
responded that these arguments are poorly supported by existing evidence.
Victor J. Stenger and other critics say both intelligent design and the weak
form of the anthropic principle are essentially a tautology; in his view, these
arguments amount to the claim that life is able to exist because the Universe
is able to support life. The claim of the improbability of a life-supporting
universe has also been criticized as an argument by lack of imagination for
assuming no other forms of life are possible. Life as we know it might not
exist if things were different, but a different sort of life might exist in its
place. A number of critics also suggest that many of the stated variables
appear to be interconnected and that calculations made by mathematicians and
physicists suggest that the emergence of a universe similar to ours is quite
probable. Intelligent designer. Intelligent design arguments are formulated in
secular terms and intentionally avoid identifying the intelligent agent (or
agents) they posit. Although they do not state that God is the designer, the
designer is often implicitly hypothesized to have intervened in a way that only
a god could intervene. Dembski, in "The Design Inference", speculates that an
alien culture could fulfill these requirements. "Of Pandas and People" proposes
that SETI illustrates an appeal to intelligent design in science. In 2000,
philosopher of science Robert T. Pennock suggested the Raëlian UFO religion as
a real-life example of an extraterrestrial intelligent designer view that "make
many of the same bad arguments against evolutionary theory as creationists".
The authoritative description of intelligent design, however, explicitly states
that the "Universe" displays features of having been designed. Acknowledging
the paradox, Dembski concludes that "no intelligent agent who is strictly
physical could have presided over the origin of the universe or the origin of
life". The leading proponents have made statements to their supporters that
they believe the designer to be the Christian God, to the exclusion of all
other religions. Beyond the debate over whether intelligent design is
scientific, a number of critics argue that existing evidence makes the design
hypothesis appear unlikely, irrespective of its status in the world of science.
For example, Jerry Coyne asks why a designer would "give us a pathway for
making vitamin C, but then destroy it by disabling one of its enzymes" (see
pseudogene) and why he or she would not "stock oceanic islands with reptiles,
mammals, amphibians, and freshwater fish, despite the suitability of such
islands for these species". Coyne also points to the fact that "the flora and
fauna on those islands resemble that of the nearest mainland, even when the
environments are very different" as evidence that species were not placed there
by a designer. Previously, in "Darwin's Black Box", Behe had argued that we are
simply incapable of understanding the designer's motives, so such questions
cannot be answered definitively. Odd designs could, for example, "have been
placed there by the designer ... for artistic reasons, to show off, for some
as-yet undetectable practical purpose, or for some unguessable reason". Coyne
responds that in light of the evidence, "either life resulted not from
intelligent design, but from evolution; or the intelligent designer is a cosmic
prankster who designed everything to make it look as though it had evolved".
Intelligent design proponents such as Paul Nelson avoid the problem of poor
design in nature by insisting that we have simply failed to understand the
perfection of the design. Behe cites Paley as his inspiration, but he differs
from Paley's expectation of a perfect Creation and proposes that designers do
not necessarily produce the best design they can. Behe suggests that, like a
parent not wanting to spoil a child with extravagant toys, the designer can
have multiple motives for not giving priority to excellence in engineering. He
says that "the argument for imperfection critically depends on a psychoanalysis
of the unidentified designer. Yet the reasons that a designer would or would
not do anything are virtually impossible to know unless the designer tells you
specifically what those reasons are." This reliance on inexplicable motives of
the designer makes intelligent design scientifically untestable. Phillip E.
Johnson puts forward a core definition that the designer creates for a purpose,
giving the example that in his view AIDS was created to punish immorality and
was not caused by HIV, but such motives cannot be tested by scientific methods.
Asserting the need for a designer of complexity also raises the question "What
designed the designer?" Intelligent design proponents say that the question is
irrelevant to or outside the scope of intelligent design. Richard Wein counters
that the unanswered questions an explanation creates "must be balanced against
the improvements in our understanding which the explanation provides. Invoking
an unexplained being to explain the origin of other beings (ourselves) is
little more than question-begging. The new question raised by the explanation
is as problematic as the question which the explanation purports to answer".
Richard Dawkins sees the assertion that the designer does not need to be
explained, not as a contribution to knowledge, but as a thought-terminating
cliché. In the absence of observable, measurable evidence, the very question
"What designed the designer?" leads to an infinite regression from which
intelligent design proponents can only escape by resorting to religious
creationism or logical contradiction. Movement. [[Image:The Creation of
Adam.jpg|thumb|left|The Discovery Institute's Center for the Renewal of Science
and Culture used banners based on "The Creation of Adam" from the Sistine
Chapel. Later it used a less religious image, then was renamed the Center for
Science and Culture.]] The intelligent design movement is a direct outgrowth of
the creationism of the 1980s. The scientific and academic communities, along
with a U.S. federal court, view intelligent design as either a form of
creationism or as a direct descendant that is closely intertwined with
traditional creationism; and several authors explicitly refer to it as
"intelligent design creationism". The movement is headquartered in the Center
for Science and Culture (CSC), established in 1996 as the creationist wing of
the Discovery Institute to promote a religious agenda calling for broad social,
academic and political changes. The Discovery Institute's intelligent design
campaigns have been staged primarily in the United States, although efforts
have been made in other countries to promote intelligent design. Leaders of the
movement say intelligent design exposes the limitations of scientific orthodoxy
and of the secular philosophy of naturalism. Intelligent design proponents
allege that science should not be limited to naturalism and should not demand
the adoption of a naturalistic philosophy that dismisses out-of-hand any
explanation that includes a supernatural cause. The overall goal of the
movement is to "defeat materialist world view" represented by the theory of
evolution in favor of "a science consonant with Christian and theistic
convictions". Phillip E. Johnson stated that the goal of intelligent design is
to cast creationism as a scientific concept. All leading intelligent design
proponents are fellows or staff of the Discovery Institute and its Center for
Science and Culture. Nearly all intelligent design concepts and the associated
movement are the products of the Discovery Institute, which guides the movement
and follows its wedge strategy while conducting its Teach the Controversy
campaign and their other related programs. Leading intelligent design
proponents have made conflicting statements regarding intelligent design. In
statements directed at the general public, they say intelligent design is not
religious; when addressing conservative Christian supporters, they state that
intelligent design has its foundation in the Bible. Recognizing the need for
support, the institute affirms its Christian, evangelistic orientation:
"Alongside a focus on influential opinion-makers, we also seek to build up a
popular base of support among our natural constituency, namely, Christians. We
will do this primarily through apologetics seminars. We intend these to
encourage and equip believers with new scientific evidences that support the
faith, as well as to 'popularize' our ideas in the broader culture." Barbara
Forrest, an expert who has written extensively on the movement, describes this
as being due to the Discovery Institute's obfuscating its agenda as a matter of
policy. She has written that the movement's "activities betray an aggressive,
systematic agenda for promoting not only intelligent design creationism, but
the religious world-view that undergirds it". Religion and leading proponents.
Although arguments for intelligent design are formulated in secular terms and
intentionally avoid positing the identity of the designer, the majority of
principal intelligent design advocates are publicly religious Christians who
have stated that, in their view, the designer proposed in intelligent design is
the Christian conception of God. Stuart Burgess, Phillip E. Johnson, William
Dembski, and Stephen C. Meyer are evangelical Protestants; Michael Behe is a
Roman Catholic; and Jonathan Wells is a member of the Unification Church. Non-
Christian proponents include David Klinghoffer, who is Jewish, Michael Denton,
who is agnostic, and Muzaffar Iqbal, a Pakistani Muslim. Phillip E. Johnson has
stated that cultivating ambiguity by employing secular language in arguments
that are carefully crafted to avoid overtones of theistic creationism is a
necessary first step for ultimately reintroducing the Christian concept of God
as the designer. Johnson explicitly calls for intelligent design proponents to
obfuscate their religious motivations so as to avoid having intelligent design
identified "as just another way of packaging the Christian evangelical
message". Johnson emphasizes that "the first thing that has to be done is to
get the Bible out of the discussion"; "after we have separated materialist
prejudice from scientific fact [...] only then can 'biblical issues' be
discussed". The strategy of deliberately disguising the religious intent of
intelligent design has been described by William Dembski in "The Design
Inference". In this work Dembski lists a god or an "alien life force" as two
possible options for the identity of the designer; however, in his book
"Intelligent Design: The Bridge Between Science and Theology", Dembski states
that "Christ is indispensable to any scientific theory, even if its
practitioners don't have a clue about him. The pragmatics of a scientific
theory can, to be sure, be pursued without recourse to Christ. But the
conceptual soundness of the theory can in the end only be located in Christ."
Dembski also stated, "ID is part of God's general revelation [...] Not only
does intelligent design rid us of this ideology (materialism), which suffocates
the human spirit, but, in my personal experience, I've found that it opens the
path for people to come to Christ". Both Johnson and Dembski cite the Bible's
Gospel of John as the foundation of intelligent design. Barbara Forrest
contends such statements reveal that leading proponents see intelligent design
as essentially religious in nature, not merely a scientific concept that has
implications with which their personal religious beliefs happen to coincide.
She writes that the leading proponents of intelligent design are closely allied
with the ultra-conservative Christian Reconstructionism movement. She lists
connections of (current and former) Discovery Institute Fellows Phillip
Johnson, Charles Thaxton, Michael Behe, Richard Weikart, Jonathan Wells and
Francis Beckwith to leading Christian Reconstructionist organizations, and the
extent of the funding provided the Institute by Howard Ahmanson Jr., a leading
figure in the Reconstructionist movement. Reaction from other creationist
groups. Not all creationist organizations have embraced the intelligent design
movement. According to Thomas Dixon, "Religious leaders have come out against
ID too. An open letter affirming the compatibility of Christian faith and the
teaching of evolution, first produced in response to controversies in Wisconsin
in 2004, has now been signed by over ten thousand clergy from different
Christian denominations across America. In 2006, the director of the Vatican
Observatory, the Jesuit astronomer George Coyne, condemned ID as a kind of
'crude creationism' which reduced God to a mere engineer." Hugh Ross of Reasons
to Believe, a proponent of Old Earth creationism, believes that the efforts of
intelligent design proponents to divorce the concept from Biblical Christianity
make its hypothesis too vague. In 2002 he wrote: "Winning the argument for
design without identifying the designer yields, at best, a sketchy origins
model. Such a model makes little if any positive impact on the community of
scientists and other scholars… The time is right for a direct approach, a
single leap into the origins fray. Introducing a biblically based,
scientifically verifiable creation model represents such a leap." Likewise, two
of the most prominent Young Earth creationism organizations in the world have
attempted to distinguish their views from intelligent design. Henry M. Morris
of the Institute for Creation Research (ICR) wrote, in 1999, that ID, "even if
well-meaning and effectively articulated, will not work! It has often been
tried in the past and has failed, and it will fail today. The reason it won't
work is because it is not the Biblical method." According to Morris: "The
evidence of intelligent design… must be either followed by or accompanied by
a sound presentation of true Biblical creationism if it is to be meaningful and
lasting." In 2002, Carl Wieland, then of Answers in Genesis (AiG), criticized
design advocates who, though well-intentioned, "left the Bible out of it" and
thereby unwittingly aided and abetted the modern rejection of the Bible.
Wieland explained that "AiG's major 'strategy' is to boldly, but humbly, call
the church back to its Biblical foundations… we neither count ourselves a
part of this movement nor campaign against it." Reaction from the scientific
community. The unequivocal consensus in the scientific community is that
intelligent design is not science and has no place in a science curriculum. The
U.S. National Academy of Sciences has stated that "creationism, intelligent
design, and other claims of supernatural intervention in the origin of life or
of species are not science because they are not testable by the methods of
science." The U.S. National Science Teachers Association and the American
Association for the Advancement of Science have termed it pseudoscience. Others
in the scientific community have denounced its tactics, accusing the ID
movement of manufacturing false attacks against evolution, of engaging in
misinformation and misrepresentation about science, and marginalizing those who
teach it. More recently, in September 2012, Bill Nye ("The Science Guy") warned
that creationist views threaten science education and innovations in The United
States. Polls. Several surveys were conducted prior to the December 2005
decision in "Kitzmiller v. Dover", which sought to determine the level of
support for intelligent design among certain groups. According to a 2005 Harris
poll, 10% of adults in the United States viewed human beings as "so complex
that they required a powerful force or intelligent being to help create them".
Although Zogby polls commissioned by the Discovery Institute show more support,
these polls suffer from considerable flaws, such as having a very low response
rate (248 out of 16,000), being conducted on behalf of an organization with an
expressed interest in the outcome of the poll, and containing leading
questions. A series of Gallup polls in the United States from 1982 through 2008
on "Evolution, Creationism, Intelligent Design" found support for "human beings
have developed over millions of years from less advanced formed of life, but
God guided the process" of between 35% and 40%, support for "God created human
beings in pretty much their present form at one time within the last 10,000
years or so" varied from 43% to 47%, and support for "human beings have
developed over millions of years from less advanced formed of life, but God had
no part in the process" varied from 9% to 14%. The polls also noted answers to
a series of more detailed questions. Film. The film "" sparked further
controversy in 2008. This documentary film, hosted by Ben Stein, presents
allegations that the mainstream science establishment, in a conspiracy to keep
God out of science laboratories and classrooms, suppresses academics who
believe they see evidence of intelligent design in nature or criticize evidence
of evolution. The film includes interviews with scientists and academics who
were misled into taking part by misrepresentation of the topic and title of the
film. Michael Shermer describes his experience of being repeatedly asked the
same question without context as "surreal". Review screenings were restricted
to churches and Christian groups, and at a special pre-release showing one of
the interviewees, PZ Myers, was refused admission. The production company,
Premise Media, also has helped finance some religious films such as "The
Passion of the Christ". The Anti-Defamation League denounced the film's
allegation that evolutionary theory influenced The Holocaust. Criticism.
Scientific criticism. Advocates of intelligent design seek to keep God and the
Bible out of the discussion, and present intelligent design in the language of
science as though it were a scientific hypothesis. For a theory to qualify as
scientific, violates the principle of parsimony, is not scientifically useful,
is not falsifiable, is not empirically testable, and is not correctable,
dynamic, provisional or progressive. by eliminating "methodological naturalism"
from science and replacing it with what the leader of the intelligent design
movement, Phillip E. Johnson, calls "theistic realism". Intelligent design
proponents argue that naturalistic explanations fail to explain certain
phenomena and that supernatural explanations provide a very simple and
intuitive explanation for the origins of life and the universe. Many
intelligent design followers believe that "Scientism" is itself a religion that
promotes secularism and materialism in an attempt to erase theism from public
life, and they view their work in the promotion of intelligent design as a way
to return religion to a central role in education and other public spheres. The
failure to follow the procedures of scientific discourse and the failure to
submit work to the scientific community that withstands scrutiny have weighed
against intelligent design being accepted as valid science. The intelligent
design movement has not published a properly peer-reviewed article supporting
ID in a scientific journal, and has failed to publish supporting peer-reviewed
research or data. The only article published in a peer-reviewed scientific
journal that made a case for intelligent design was quickly withdrawn by the
publisher for having circumvented the journal's peer-review standards. The
Discovery Institute says that a number of intelligent design articles have been
published in peer-reviewed journals, but critics, largely members of the
scientific community, reject this claim and state intelligent design proponents
have set up their own journals with peer review that lack impartiality and
rigor, consisting entirely of intelligent design supporters. Further criticism
stems from the fact that the phrase "intelligent" design makes use of an
assumption of the quality of an observable intelligence, a concept that has no
scientific consensus definition. William Dembski, for example, has written that
"Intelligence leaves behind a characteristic signature". The characteristics of
intelligence are assumed by intelligent design proponents to be observable
without specifying what the criteria for the measurement of intelligence should
be. Critics say that the design detection methods proposed by intelligent
design proponents are radically different from conventional design detection,
undermining the key elements that make it possible as legitimate science.
Intelligent design proponents, they say, are proposing both searching for a
designer without knowing anything about that designer's abilities, parameters,
or intentions (which scientists do know when searching for the results of human
intelligence), as well as denying the very distinction between natural/
artificial design that allows scientists to compare complex designed artifacts
against the background of the sorts of complexity found in nature. Among a
significant proportion of the general public in the United States, the major
concern is whether conventional evolutionary biology is compatible with belief
in God and in the Bible, and how this issue is taught in schools. The Discovery
Institute's "Teach the Controversy" campaign promotes intelligent design while
attempting to discredit evolution in United States public high school science
courses. The scientific community and science education organizations have
replied that there is no scientific controversy regarding the validity of
evolution and that the controversy exists solely in terms of religion and
politics. Arguments from ignorance. Eugenie Scott, along with Glenn Branch and
other critics, has argued that many points raised by intelligent design
proponents are arguments from ignorance. In the argument from ignorance, a lack
of evidence for one view is erroneously argued to constitute proof of the
correctness of another view. Scott and Branch say that intelligent design is an
argument from ignorance because it relies on a lack of knowledge for its
conclusion: lacking a natural explanation for certain specific aspects of
evolution, we assume intelligent cause. They contend most scientists would
reply that the unexplained is not unexplainable, and that "we don't know yet"
is a more appropriate response than invoking a cause outside science.
Particularly, Michael Behe's demands for ever more detailed explanations of the
historical evolution of molecular systems seem to assume a false dichotomy,
where either evolution or design is the proper explanation, and any perceived
failure of evolution becomes a victory for design. Scott and Branch also
contend that the supposedly novel contributions proposed by intelligent design
proponents have not served as the basis for any productive scientific research.
In his conclusion to the Kitzmiller trial, Judge Jones wrote that "ID is at
bottom premised upon a false dichotomy, namely, that to the extent evolutionary
theory is discredited, ID is confirmed." This same argument had been put
forward to support creation science at the "McLean v. Arkansas" trial which
found it was "contrived dualism", the false premise of a "two-model approach".
Behe's argument of irreducible complexity puts forward negative arguments
against evolution but does not make any positive scientific case for
intelligent design. It fails to allow for scientific explanations continuing to
be found, as has been the case with several examples previously put forward as
supposed cases of irreducible complexity. Theological issues. The insistence of
intelligent design on repeated miraculous interventions rather than designed
laws raises theological difficulties for those who believe that God's design
must be perfect and should not need such changes. The claim to be scientific
implies that science can test religion, and the problem of evil raises the
issue of a lack of miraculous intervention to reduce suffering. Intelligent
design proponents avoid the problem of poor design in nature by insisting that
we have simply failed to understand the perfection of the design, or by
proposing that designers do not necessarily produce the best design they can,
and may have unknowable motives for their actions. God of the gaps. A God-of-
the-gaps argument is the theological version of an argument from ignorance. A
key feature of this type of argument is that it merely answers outstanding
questions with explanations (often supernatural) that are unverifiable and
ultimately themselves subject to unanswerable questions. Historians of science
observe that the astronomy of the earliest civilizations, although astonishing
and incorporating mathematical constructions far in excess of any practical
value, proved to be misdirected and of little importance to the development of
science because they failed to inquire more carefully into the mechanisms that
drove the heavenly bodies across the sky. It was the Greek civilization that
first practised science, although not yet a mathematically-oriented
experimental science, but nevertheless an attempt to rationalize the world of
natural experience without recourse to divine intervention. In this
historically motivated definition of science any appeal to an intelligent
creator is explicitly excluded for the paralysing effect it may have on the
scientific progress. Kitzmiller trial. "Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School
District" was the first direct challenge brought in the United States federal
courts against a public school district that required the presentation of
intelligent design as an alternative to evolution. The plaintiffs successfully
argued that intelligent design is a form of creationism, and that the school
board policy thus violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to
the United States Constitution. Eleven parents of students in Dover,
Pennsylvania, sued the Dover Area School District over a statement that the
school board required be read aloud in ninth-grade science classes when
evolution was taught. The plaintiffs were represented by the American Civil
Liberties Union (ACLU), Americans United for Separation of Church and State
(AU) and Pepper Hamilton LLP. The National Center for Science Education (NCSE)
acted as consultants for the plaintiffs. The defendants were represented by the
Thomas More Law Center. The suit was tried in a bench trial from September 26
to November 4, 2005, before Judge John E. Jones III. Ken Miller, Kevin Padian,
Brian Alters, Robert Pennock, Barbara Forrest and John Haught served as expert
witnesses for the plaintiffs. Michael Behe, Steve Fuller and Scott Minnich
served as expert witnesses for the defense. On December 20, 2005, Judge Jones
issued his 139-page findings of fact and decision, the Dover mandate was
unconstitutional, and barring intelligent design from being taught in
Pennsylvania's Middle District public school science classrooms. The eight
Dover school board members who voted for the intelligent design requirement
were all defeated in a November 8, 2005, election by challengers who opposed
the teaching of intelligent design in a science class, and the current school
board president stated that the board does not intend to appeal the ruling.
"Moreover, ID's backers have sought to avoid the scientific scrutiny which we
have now determined that it cannot withstand by advocating that the
controversy, but not ID itself, should be taught in science class. This tactic
is at best disingenuous, and at worst a ." Reaction. , .   Newspapers have
noted with interest that the judge is "a Republican and a churchgoer".
Subsequently, the decision has been examined in a search for flaws and
conclusions, partly by intelligent design supporters aiming to avoid future
defeats in court. In the Spring of 2007 the University of Montana Law review
published three articles. In the first, David K. DeWolf, John G. West and Casey
Luskin, all of the Discovery Institute, argued that intelligent design is a
valid scientific theory, the Jones court should not have addressed the question
of whether it was a scientific theory, and that the Kitzmiller decision will
have no effect at all on the development and adoption of intelligent design as
an alternative to standard evolutionary theory. In the second Peter Irons
responded, arguing that the decision was extremely well reasoned and spells the
death knell for the intelligent design efforts to introduce creationism in
public schools, while in the third, DeWolf et al. answer the points made by
Irons. However, fear of a similar lawsuit has resulted in other school boards
abandoning intelligent design "teach the controversy" proposals. In April 2010,
the American Academy of Religion issued "Guidelines for Teaching About Religion
in K-12 Public Schools in the United States", which included guidance that
Creation Science or intelligent design should not be taught in science classes,
as "Creation science and intelligent design represent worldviews that fall
outside of the realm of science that is defined as (and limited to) a method of
inquiry based on gathering observable and measurable evidence subject to
specific principles of reasoning." However, they, as well as other "worldviews
that focus on speculation regarding the origins of life represent another
important and relevant form of human inquiry that is appropriately studied in
literature or social sciences courses. Such study, however, must include a
diversity of worldviews representing a variety of religious and philosophical
perspectives and must avoid privileging one view as more legitimate than
others." Status outside the United States. Europe. In June 2007 the Council of
Europe's "Committee on Culture, Science and Education" issued a report, "The
dangers of creationism in education", which states "Creationism in any of its
forms, such as 'intelligent design', is not based on facts, does not use any
scientific reasoning and its contents are pathetically inadequate for science
classes." In describing the dangers posed to education by teaching creationism,
it described intelligent design as "anti-science" and involving "blatant
scientific fraud" and "intellectual deception" that "blurs the nature,
objectives and limits of science" and links it and other forms of creationism
to denialism. On October 4, 2007, the Council of Europe's Parliamentary
Assembly approved a resolution stating that schools should "resist presentation
of creationist ideas in any discipline other than religion", including
"intelligent design", which it described as "the latest, more refined version
of creationism", "presented in a more subtle way". The resolution emphasises
that the aim of the report is not to question or to fight a belief, but to
"warn against certain tendencies to pass off a belief as science". In the
United Kingdom, public education includes Religious Education as a compulsory
subject, and there are many faith schools that teach the ethos of particular
denominations. When it was revealed that a group called Truth in Science had
distributed DVDs produced by the Discovery Institute affiliate Illustra Media
featuring Discovery Institute fellows making the case for design in nature, and
claimed they were being used by 59 schools, the Department for Education and
Skills (DfES) stated that "Neither creationism nor intelligent design are
taught as a subject in schools, and are not specified in the science
curriculum" (part of the National Curriculum, which does not apply to
independent schools or to education in Scotland). The DfES subsequently stated
that "Intelligent design is not a recognised scientific theory; therefore, it
is not included in the science curriculum", but left the way open for it to be
explored in religious education in relation to different beliefs, as part of a
syllabus set by a local Standing Advisory Council on Religious Education. In
2006 the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority produced a Religious Education
model unit in which pupils can learn about religious and nonreligious views
about creationism, intelligent design and evolution by natural selection. On
June 25, 2007, the UK Government responded to an e-petition by saying that
creationism and intelligent design should not be taught as science, though
teachers would be expected to answer pupils' questions within the standard
framework of established scientific theories. Detailed government "Creationism
teaching guidance" for schools in England was published on September 18, 2007.
It states that "Intelligent design lies wholly outside of science", has no
underpinning scientific principles, or explanations, and is not accepted by the
science community as a whole. Though it should not be taught as science,
"questions about creationism and intelligent design which arise in science
lessons, for example, as a result of media coverage, could provide the
opportunity to explain or explore why they are not considered to be scientific
theories and, in the right context, why evolution is considered to be a
scientific theory". However, "Teachers of subjects such as RE, history or
citizenship may deal with creationism and intelligent design in their lessons".
The British Centre for Science Education lobbying group has the goal of
"countering creationism within the UK" and has been involved in government
lobbying in the UK in this regard. Northern Ireland's Department for Education
says that the curriculum provides an opportunity for alternative theories to be
taught. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP)—which has links to fundamentalist
Christianity—has been campaigning to have intelligent design taught in
science classes. A DUP former Member of Parliament, David Simpson, has sought
assurances from the education minister that pupils will not lose marks if they
give creationist or intelligent design answers to science questions.* In 2007,
Lisburn city council voted in favor of a DUP recommendation to write to post-
primary schools asking what their plans are to develop teaching material in
relation to "creation, intelligent design and other theories of origin". Plans
by Dutch Education Minister Maria van der Hoeven to "stimulate an academic
debate" on the subject in 2005 caused a severe public backlash. After the 2007
elections she was succeeded by Ronald Plasterk, described as a "molecular
geneticist, staunch atheist and opponent of intelligent design". As a reaction
on this situation in the Netherlands, in Belgium the President of the Flemish
Catholic Educational Board (VSKO) Mieke Van Hecke declared that: "Catholic
scientists already accepted the theory of evolution for a long time and that
intelligent design and creationism doesn't belong in Flemish Catholic schools.
It's not the tasks of the politics to introduce new ideas, that's task and goal
of science." Relation to Islam. Muzaffar Iqbal, a notable Muslim in Canada,
signed the "Scientific Dissent" list of the Discovery Institute. Ideas similar
to intelligent design have been considered respected intellectual options among
Muslims, and in Turkey many intelligent design books have been translated. In
Istanbul in 2007, public meetings promoting intelligent design were sponsored
by the local government, and David Berlinski of the Discovery Institute was the
keynote speaker at a meeting in May 2007. Relation to ISKCON. In 2010 the
ISKCON Bhaktivedanta Book Trust published an intelligent design book titled
"Rethinking Darwin: A Vedic Study of Darwinism and Intelligent Design" chapters
included contributions from intelligent design advocates William Dembski,
Jonathan Wells and Michael Behe as well as from Hindu creationists Leif A.
Jansen and Michael Cremo. Australia. The status of intelligent design in
Australia is somewhat similar to that in the UK (see Education in Australia).
When the former Australian Federal Education Minister, Brendan Nelson, raised
the notion of intelligent design being taught in science classes, the public
outcry caused the minister to quickly concede that the correct forum for
intelligent design, if it were to be taught, is in religious or philosophy
classes. The Australian chapter of Campus Crusade for Christ distributed a DVD
of the Discovery Institute's documentary "Unlocking the Mystery of Life" to
Australian secondary schools. The head of one of Australia's leading private
schools supported use of the DVD in the classroom at the discretion of teachers
and principals.
