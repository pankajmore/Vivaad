Shrines to the Virgin Mary In the culture and practice of some Christian
churches - mainly, but not solely, the Roman Catholic Church - a Shrine to the
Virgin Mary (or Marian shrine) is a shrine marking an apparition or other
miracle ascribed to the Blessed Virgin Mary, or a site on which is centered a
historically strong Marian devotion. Such locales are often the destination of
pilgrimages Some of the largest shrines are due to reported Marian apparitions
to young and simple people on remote hilltops that had hardly been heard of
prior to the reported apparition. The case of Saint Juan Diego's reported
vision of Our Lady of Guadalupe in 1531 is similar to the case of Saint
Bernadette Soubirous's vision in 1858 of Our Lady of Lourdes. Both saints
reported a miraculous Lady on a hilltop who asked them to request that the
local priests build a chapel at the site of the vision. Both visions included a
reference to roses and led to large churches being built at the sites. Like Our
Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico, Our Lady of Lourdes is a major Catholic symbol in
France. Both visionaries were eventually declared saints. The number of
pilgrims who visit some of these shrines every year can be significant. E.g.
Lourdes with a population of around 15,000 people, receives about 5,000,000
pilgrims every year and within France only Paris has more hotel rooms than
Lourdes. Over 1,000,000 pilgrims visit the Black Madonna statue in the Chapel
of Grace in Altötting, Germany every year, where for more than 500 years
miracles have been attributed to praying to the Virgin Mary at that shrine.
