Trinity The Christian doctrine of the Trinity defines God as three divine
persons or "hypostases": the Father, the Son (Jesus Christ), and the Holy
Spirit. The three persons are distinct yet coexist in unity, and are co-equal,
co-eternal and consubstantial. Put another way, the three persons of the
Trinity are of one being or "ousia". The Trinity is considered to be a mystery
of Christian faith. According to this doctrine, there is only one God in three
persons. Each person is God, whole and entire. They are distinct from one
another in their relations of origin: as the Fourth Lateran Council declared,
"it is the Father who generates, the Son who is begotten, and the Holy Spirit
who proceeds". While distinct in their relations with one another, they are one
in all else. The whole work of creation and grace is a single operation common
to all three divine persons, who at the same time operate according to their
unique properties, so that all things are from the Father, through the Son and
in the Holy Spirit. Trinitarianism (one deity in three persons) contrasts with
nontrinitarian positions which include Binitarianism (one deity in two persons,
or two deities), Unitarianism (one deity in one person, analogous to Jewish
interpretation of the Shema and Muslim belief in Tawhid), Oneness
Pentecostalism or Modalism (one deity manifested in three separate aspects),
and social trinitarianism (three deities in three persons). Etymology. The
English word "Trinity" is derived from Latin "Trinitas", meaning "the number
three, a triad". This abstract noun is formed from the adjective "trinus"
(three each, threefold, triple), as the word "unitas" is the abstract noun
formed from "unus" (one). The corresponding word in Greek is "", meaning "a set
of three" or "the number three".  Tertullian, a Latin theologian who wrote in
the early 3rd century, is credited with using the words "Trinity", "person" and
"substance" to explain that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are "one in
essence‚Äînot one in Person". About a century later, in 325, the First Council
of Nicaea established the doctrine of the Trinity as orthodoxy and adopted the
Nicene Creed, which described Christ as "God of God, Light of Light, very God
of very God, begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father".
Personhood. In the Trinity doctrine, each "person" is understood as having the
identical essence or nature, not merely similar natures. The being of Christ
can be said to have dominated theological discussions and councils of the
church until the 7th century, and resulted in the Nicene and Constantinopolitan
creeds, the Ephesine Formula of 431, the Christological statement of the
Epistola Dogmatica of Leo I to Flavianus, and the condemnation of Monothelism
in the Sixth Ecumenical Council (680‚Äì681). From these councils, the following
christological doctrines were condemned as heresies: Ebionism, Docetism,
Basilidianism, Alogism or Artemonism, Patripassianism, Sabellianism, Arianism,
Apollinarianism, Nestorianism, Eutychianism, Monophysitism, and Monothelitism.
Since the beginning of the 3rd century the doctrine of the Trinity has been
stated as "the one God exists in three Persons and one substance, Father, Son,
and Holy Spirit." "Trinitarianism", belief in the Trinity, is a mark of Roman
Catholicism, Eastern and Oriental Orthodoxy as well as of the "mainstream
traditions" arising from the Protestant Reformation, such as Anglicanism,
Baptist, Methodism, Lutheranism and Presbyterianism. "The Oxford Dictionary of
the Christian Church" describes the Trinity as "the central dogma of Christian
theology". References used from Scripture. Although the New Testament does not
use the word "Œ§œÅŒπŒ¨œÇ" (Trinity) nor explicitly teach it, it provided the
material upon which the doctrine of the Trinity was formulated. Reflection by
early Christians on passages such as the Great Commission: "Go therefore and
make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of
the Son and of the Holy Spirit" and Paul the Apostle's blessing: "The grace of
the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit
be with you all," while at the same time the Jewish Shema Yisrael: "Hear, O
Israel: the Lord our God, the Lord is one." led the early Christians to
question how the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are "one". Later, the diverse
references to God, Jesus, and the Spirit found in the New Testament were
systematized into a Trinity‚Äîone God subsisting in three persons and one
substance‚Äîto combat heretical tendencies of how the three are related and to
defend the church against charges of worshiping two or three gods. In addition,
the Old Testament has also been interpreted as foreshadowing the Trinity, by
referring to God's word, his spirit, and Wisdom, as well as narratives such as
the appearance of the three men to Abraham. However, it is generally agreed
that it would go beyond the intention and spirit of the Old Testament to
correlate these notions directly with later Trinitarian doctrine. Some scholars
dispute the authenticity of the Trinity and argue that the doctrine is the
result of "later theological interpretations of Christ's nature and function."
The concept was expressed in early writings from the beginning of the 2nd
century forward, and other scholars hold that the way the New Testament
repeatedly speaks of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit is such as to
"compel a trinitarian understanding of God". References to Father, Son, and
Holy Spirit. Some biblical verses specifically reference the Father, Son, and
Holy Spirit as distinct entities in a single narrative. While trinitarians
interpret these passages as support for the notion of a Trinity, because these
verses speak of distinct entities mentioned by name, and not of a Trinity, non-
trinitarians also appeal to these verses in support of their argument that a
Trinity was not envisioned at the time of their authorship. Some verses also
reference the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as part of a single formula, which
trinitarians view as support of a Trinity, though not explicitly stated. Non-
trinitarians argue that because these verses are conclusions to their
respective books, they may be later trinitarian formulaic additions to the
original works, which were added after the doctrine of the Trinity had begun to
be debated and accepted as dogmatic. Comma Johanneum. In addition to these, ,
which is found in the King James Version and the Douay-Rheims (it is a reading
attested in the Textus Receptus, the Clementine Vulgate, and in a minority of
manuscripts of the Byzantine text-type, but not in any of the Alexandrian
manuscripts), and is absent from most modern English translations (the NASB and
NKJV are exceptions), states: "For there are three that bear record in heaven,
the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one." However,
this Comma Johanneum is not considered to be part of the genuine text. It is
not included in the official Latin text of the Roman Catholic Church, nor in
Vulgate manuscripts earlier than about AD 800. Jerome, the author of the
Vulgate, seems not to have known the text. The earliest undoubted reference to
it is by 4th-century Priscillian, but some hold that it was referred to by 3rd-
century Cyprian. It is commonly found in Latin manuscripts other than the
earliest, but is absent from the Greek manuscripts except for a few late
examples, where the passage appears to have been back-translated from the
Latin. Erasmus, the compiler of the "Textus Receptus", on which the King James
Version was based, noticed that the passage was not found in any of the Greek
manuscripts at his disposal and refused to include it until presented with a
manuscript containing it, while still suspecting, as is now agreed, that the
phrase was a gloss. Jesus as God. As opposed to the Synoptic Gospels, the
Gospel of John has been seen as aimed at emphasizing Jesus' divinity,
presenting Jesus as the Logos, pre-existent and divine, from its first words,
"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was
God." John also portrays Jesus as the creator of the universe, such that
"without him was not any thing made that was made." The Gospel of John ends
with Thomas's apparent confession of faith to Jesus, "My Lord and my God!"
There is no significant tendency among modern scholars to deny that John 1:
1 and John 20:28 identify Jesus with God. Other passages of John's Gospel
interpreted in this sense include, "Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham
was, I am.", "I and the Father are one.", "...the Father is in me and I am in
the Father.", and "...he was even calling God his own Father, making himself
equal with God." John is also seen to identify Jesus as the Lord whom Isaiah
saw, while other texts are also understood as referring to Jesus as God. There
are also a few possible biblical supports for the Trinity found in the Synoptic
Gospels. The Gospel of Matthew, for example, quotes Jesus as saying, "all
things have been handed over to me by my Father". This is similar to John, who
wrote that Jesus said, "All that the Father has is mine". These verses have
been quoted to defend the omnipotence of Christ, having all power, as well as
the omniscience of Christ, having all wisdom. Expressions also in the Pauline
epistles have been interpreted as attributing divinity to Jesus. They include:
"For by him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and
invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things were
created by him and for him" and "For in Christ all the fullness of the Deity
lives in bodily form", and in Paul the Apostle's claim to have been "sent not
from men nor by man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father". In the prophet
records his vision of "one like a son of man, coming with the clouds of
heaven", who "was given authority, glory and sovereign power; all peoples,
nations and men of every language worshiped him" (v. 14). Christians believe
that worship is only properly given to God, and that considering other Bible
passages this "son of man" can be identified as the second person of the
Trinity. Parallels may be drawn between Daniel's vision and Jesus' words to the
Jewish high priest that in the future those assembled would see "the son of Man
sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of
heaven." Jesus was immediately accused of blasphemy, as at other times when he
had identified his unity with the Father. Christians also believe that John saw
the resurrected, glorified Jesus and described him as "One like the Son of
man." Some believe the Trinity was also introduced in the Old Testament book of
Isaiah written around 700 years before Jesus, copies of which were preserved
from 300 years before Jesus in the Dead Sea Scrolls. prophesies "For unto us a
Child is born, Unto us a Son is given; And the government will be upon his
shoulder. And his name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,
Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace." Thus a son who will be born at a
particular point in history who is called "Mighty God". Some non-Trinitarians
argue that this passage would also imply that Jesus is the Father, the first
person in the Trinity. However, Trinitarians contend that Jesus is the second
person in the Trinity, and he is called "Everlasting Father" because of his
role as Creator of men, as well as his oneness with, and likeness to, the first
person of the Trinity. Another possible biblical demonstration of the deity of
Jesus comes from the biblical scholar Granville Sharp who noted the
construction of a particular Greek idiom, which is now called Granville Sharp's
rule. According to the rule, when two nouns that are personal, singular, and
not proper names are connected in a TSKS pattern
(The‚ÄîSubstantive‚ÄîKai‚ÄîSubstantive, where 'kai' is Greek for 'and') then
the two nouns refer to the same person. Passages like and fit this pattern.
Therefore, when Paul says: "The great God and savior, Jesus Christ" he is
grammatically identifying Jesus Christ as the great God. Proper nouns are not
used in this phrase. In his review of over 1,000 years of Greek literature,
Christopher Wordsworth confirmed that early church Fathers had this same
understanding of the text. An opposing view of the Granville Sharp rule,
however, argues that in Matthew 21:12 Jesus ‚Äòcast out all those that were
selling and buying in the temple,‚Äô (œÑŒø·Ω∫œÇ œÄœâŒªŒø·ø¶ŒΩœÑŒ±œÇ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂
·ºÄŒ≥ŒøœÅŒ¨Œ∂ŒøŒΩœÑŒ±œÇ). So, too, in Mark 11:15, the two classes are made
distinct by the insertion of œÑŒøœçœÇ before ·ºÄŒ≥ŒøœÅŒ¨Œ∂ŒøŒΩœÑŒ±œÇ. Because
of this, they argue that no one can reasonably suppose that the same persons
are here described as both selling and buying, yet they fit within the
Granville Sharp rule's construction. Therefore, according to this view, there
is biblical evidence to distinguish between "the great God" and "our Saviour,
Jesus Christ" in Titus 2:13, and by extension, 2 Peter 1:1. However, unlike 2
Peter 1:1 and Titus 2:13, Matthew 21:12 and Mark 11:15 do not fit Sharp's rule,
since they use plural participles, not singular personal nouns. Some have
suggested that John presents a hierarchy when he quotes Jesus as saying, "The
Father is greater than I", a statement which was appealed to by non-trinitarian
groups such as Arianism. However, Church Fathers such as Augustine of Hippo
argued this statement was to be understood as Jesus speaking in the form of a
man. Others have suggested that passages in the Synoptic Gospels contradict the
Trinity. For example, the Agnoetae sect argued that Jesus himself denied
omniscience, when he said "but of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no,
not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father". However,
the Church Fathers reasoned that, in the Bible, "to know" can sometimes mean
"to reveal". For example, Augustine of Hippo argued that when Deuteronomy 13:
3 said "the LORD your God is testing you, to know whether you love the LORD
your God with all your heart", "to know" here meant "to reveal". So too, Mark
13:32 could be saying that the Father alone "reveals" that day, but Jesus
himself could know the day as well. This is supported by passages that seem to
argue that Jesus did know all things, such as, "He said to him the third time,
'Simon, son of John, do you love me?' Peter was grieved because he said to him
the third time, 'Do you love me?' and he said to him, 'Lord, you know
everything; you know that I love you.' Jesus said to him, 'Feed my sheep.'"
Holy Spirit as God. As the Arian controversy was dwindling down, the debate
moved from the deity of Jesus Christ to the equality of the Holy Spirit with
the Father and Son. On one hand, the Pneumatomachi sect declared that the Holy
Spirit was an inferior person to the Father and Son. On the other hand, the
Cappadocian Fathers argued that the Holy Spirit was an equal person to the
Father and Son. Although the main text used in defense of the deity of the Holy
Spirit was Matthew 28:19, Cappadocian Fathers such as Basil the Great argued
from other verses such as "But Peter said, 'Ananias, why has Satan filled your
heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back for yourself part of the
proceeds of the land? While it remained unsold, did it not remain your own? And
after it was sold, was it not at your disposal? Why is it that you have
contrived this deed in your heart? You have not lied to men but to God.'"
Another passage the Cappadocian Fathers quoted from was "By the word of the
Lord the heavens were made, and by the breath of his mouth all their host."
According to their understanding, because "breath" and "spirit" in Hebrew are
both "◊®◊ï÷º◊ó÷∑" ("ruach"), Psalm 33:6 is revealing the roles of the Son and
Holy Spirit as co-creators. And since, according to them, because the holy God
can only create holy beings such as the angels, the Son and Holy Spirit must be
God. Yet another argument from the Cappadocian Fathers to prove that the Holy
Spirit is of the same nature as the Father and Son comes from "For who knows a
person's thoughts except the spirit of that person, which is in him? So also no
one comprehends the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God." They reasoned
that this passage proves that the Holy Spirit has the same relationship to God
as the spirit within us has to us. The Cappadocian Fathers also quoted, "Do you
not know that you are God's temple and that God's Spirit dwells in you?" and
reasoned that it would be blasphemous for an inferior being to take up
residence in a temple of God, thus proving that the Holy Spirit is equal with
the Father and the Son. They also combined "the servant does not know what his
master is doing" with 1 Corinthians 2:11 in an attempt to show that the Holy
Spirit is not the slave of God, and therefore his equal. The Pneumatomachi
contradicted the Cappadocian Fathers by quoting, "Are they not all ministering
spirits sent out to serve for the sake of those who are to inherit salvation?",
in effect arguing that the Holy Spirit is no different than other created
angelic spirits. The Church Fathers disagreed, saying that the Holy Spirit is
greater than the angels, since the Holy Spirit is the one who grants the
foreknowledge for prophecy so that the angels could announce events to come.
Claims of Old Testament prefigurations. Genesis 18‚Äì19 have been interpreted
by Christians as a Trinitarian text. The narrative has the Lord appearing to
Abraham, who was visited by three men. Then in , "the two angels" visited Lot
at Sodom. The interplay between Abraham on the one hand, and the Lord/three
men/the two angels on the other was an intriguing text for those who believed
in a single God in three persons. Justin Martyr, and John Calvin similarly,
interpreted it such that Abraham was visited by God, who was accompanied by two
angels. Justin supposed that the god who visited Abraham was distinguishable
from the god who remains in the heavens, but was nevertheless identified as the
(monotheistic) god. Justin appropriated the god who visited Abraham to Jesus,
the second person of the Trinity. Augustine, in contrast, held that the three
visitors to Abraham were the three persons of the Trinity. He saw no indication
that the visitors were unequal, as would be the case in Justin's reading. Then
in , two of the visitors were addressed by Lot in the singular: "Lot said to
them, 'Not so, my lord. Augustine saw that Lot could address them as one
because they had a single substance, despite the plurality of persons. Some
Christians see indications in the Old Testament of a plurality and unity in
God, an idea that is rejected by Judaism. According to Swedenborg, the three
angels which appeared to Abraham do represent the Trinity, but a Trinity of one
being: the Divine Itself, the Divine Human and the Divine Proceeding. That one
being is represented is indicated by the fact that they are referred to in the
singular as Jehovah and Lord. The reason why only two of the angels went to
visit Sodom and Gomorrah is that they represent the Divine Human and the Divine
Proceeding, and to those aspects of the Divine belongs judgment, as Jesus
declared that all judgment was entrusted by the Father to the Son . The three
angels did indeed appear to Abraham as three men, but they are only a symbolic
representation of the Trinity, which should not be taken literally as three
distinct persons. In the Old Testament, Swedenborg finds the earliest direct
reference to a Trine in the Divinity in the account of Moses' encounter with
the Lord in Exodus which states, "And Jehovah passed by upon his face, and
called, Jehovah, Jehovah, a God merciful and gracious." Some Christians
interpret the theophanies or appearances of the Angel of the Lord as
revelations of a person distinct from God, who is nonetheless called God. This
interpretation is found in Christianity as early as Justin Martyr and Melito of
Sardis, and reflects ideas that were already present in Philo. The Old
Testament theophanies were thus seen as Christophanies, each a "preincarnate
appearance of the Messiah". History. Ignatius of Antioch is seen providing
early support for the Trinity around 110, exhorting obedience to "Christ, and
to the Father, and to the Spirit." Justin Martyr (AD 100‚Äìca.165) also writes,
"in the name of God, the Father and Lord of the universe, and of our Saviour
Jesus Christ, and of the Holy Spirit." However, the first of the early church
fathers recorded as actually using the word Trinity was Theophilus of Antioch
writing in the late second century. He defines the Trinity as God, His Word
(Logos) and His Wisdom (Sophia) in the context of a discussion of the first
three days of creation. The first defence of the doctrine of the Trinity was in
the early third century by the early church father Tertullian. He explicitly
defined the Trinity as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit and defended the
Trinitarian theology against the "Praxean" heresy. Although there is much
debate as to whether the beliefs of the Apostles were merely articulated and
explained in the Trinitarian Creeds, or were corrupted and replaced with new
beliefs, all scholars recognize that the Creeds themselves were created in
reaction to disagreements over the nature of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
These controversies, however, were great and many, and took some centuries to
be resolved. Of these controversies, the most significant developments were
articulated in the first four centuries by the Church Fathers in reaction to
Adoptionism, Sabellianism, and Arianism. Adoptionism was the belief that Jesus
was an ordinary man, born of Joseph and Mary, who became the Christ and Son of
God at his baptism. In 269, the Synods of Antioch condemned Paul of Samosata
for his Adoptionist theology, and also condemned the term "homoousios"
(·ΩÅŒºŒøŒøœçœÉŒπŒøœÇ, "of the same being") in the sense he used it.
Sabellianism taught that the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are aspects of how
humanity has interacted with or experienced God. In the role of the Father, God
is the provider and creator of all. In the role of the Son, God is manifested
in the flesh as a human to bring about the salvation of mankind. In the role of
the Holy Spirit, God manifests himself from heaven through his actions on the
earth and within the lives of Christians. This view was rejected as heresy by
the Ecumenical Councils. Arianism, which was coming into prominence during the
4th century along with Trinitarianism, taught that the Father came before the
Son, and that the Son was a distinct being from the Holy Spirit. In 325, the
Council of Nicaea adopted the term "homoousios" to define the relationship
between the Father and the Son that from then on was seen as the hallmark of
orthodoxy. This was further developed into the formula "three persons, one
being". Saint Athanasius, who was a participant in the Council, stated that the
bishops were forced to use this terminology, which is not found in Scripture,
because the Biblical phrases that they would have preferred to use were claimed
by the Arians to be capable of being interpreted in what the bishops considered
to be a heretical sense. They therefore "commandeered the non-scriptural term
"homoousios" to safeguard the essential relation of the Son to the Father that
had been denied by Arius." Moreover, the meanings of "ousia" and "hypostasis"
overlapped then, so that "hypostasis" for some meant "essence" and for others
"person". Athanasius of Alexandria (293‚Äì373) helped to separate the terms.
The Confession of the Council of Nicaea said little about the Holy Spirit. The
doctrine of the divinity and personality of the Holy Spirit was developed by
Athanasius in the last decades of his life. He defended and refined the Nicene
formula. By the end of the 4th century, under the leadership of Basil of
Caesarea, Gregory of Nyssa, and Gregory of Nazianzus (the Cappadocian Fathers),
the doctrine had reached substantially its current form. The Ante-Nicene
Fathers, although likely foreign to the specifics of Trinitarian theology
because they were not defined until the 4th century, nevertheless affirmed
Christ's deity and referenced "Father, Son and Holy Spirit". Trinitarians view
these as elements of the codified doctrine. By the end of the 4th century, as a
result of controversies concerning the proper sense in which to apply to God,
Christ and the Holy Spirit terms such as "person", "nature", "essence", and
"substance", the doctrine of the Trinity took the form that has since been
maintained in all the historic confessions of Christianity. Theology. Baptism
as the beginning lesson. Baptism is generally conferred with the Trinitarian
formula, "in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit."
Trinitarians identify this name with the Christian faith into which baptism is
an initiation, as seen for example in the statement of Basil the Great
(330‚Äì379): "We are bound to be baptized in the terms we have received, and to
profess faith in the terms in which we have been baptized." "This is the Faith
of our baptism", the First Council of Constantinople also says (382), "that
teaches us to believe in the Name of the Father, of the Son and of the Holy
Spirit. According to this Faith there is one Godhead, Power, and Being of the
Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit." Those who place great emphasis on
the baptisms in Acts often likewise question the authenticity of in its present
form. A. Ploughman, apparently following F. C. Conybeare, has questioned the
authenticity of , but most scholars of New Testament textual criticism accept
the authenticity of the passage, since there are no variant manuscripts
regarding the formula, and the extant form of the passage is attested in the
Didache and other patristic works of the 1st and 2nd centuries: Ignatius,
Tertullian, Hippolytus, Cyprian, and Gregory Thaumaturgus. The Acts of the
Apostles only mentions believers being baptized "in the name of Jesus Christ"
and "in the name of the Lord Jesus." There are no biblical references to
baptism in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit outside
of , nor references, biblical or patristic, to baptism in the name of (the
Lord) Jesus (Christ) outside the Acts of the Apostles. In the synoptic Gospels
the baptism of Jesus is often interpreted as a manifestation of all three
persons of the Trinity: "And when Jesus was baptized, he went up immediately
from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened and he saw the spirit of
God descending like a dove, and alighting on him; and lo, a voice from heaven,
saying, 'This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased. One God. In the
Trinitarian view, the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost share the one
essence, substance or being. The central and crucial affirmation of Christian
faith is that there is one savior, God, and one salvation, manifest in Jesus
Christ, to which there is access only because of the Holy Spirit. The God of
the Old Testament is still the same as the God of the New. In Christianity,
statements about a single God are intended to distinguish the Hebraic
understanding from the polytheistic view, which see divine power as shared by
several beings, beings which can and do disagree and have conflicts with each
other. God in three persons. In Trinitarian doctrine, God exists as three
"persons" or "hypostases", but is one being, that is, has but a single divine
nature. Chalcedonians‚ÄîRoman Catholics, Orthodox Christians, and
Protestants‚Äîhold that, in addition, the second person of the Trinity‚ÄîGod
the Son, Jesus‚Äîassumed human nature, so that he has two natures (and hence
two wills), and is really and fully both true God and true human. In the
Oriental Orthodox theology, the Chalcedonian formulation is rejected in favor
of the position of the 3rd ecumenical council that the union of the two
natures, though unconfused, births a third nature: redeemed humanity, the new
creation, following Christology of St Cyril of Alexandria and the formula
"ŒºŒØŒ± œÜœçœÉŒπœÇ œÑŒø·ø¶ Œ∏ŒµŒø·ø¶ ŒªœåŒ≥ŒøœÖ œÉŒµœÉŒ±œÅŒ∫œâŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒ∑" ‚Äì
Jesus Christ being really and fully both true God and true human. This doctrine
is not to be confused with monophysitism which is condemned by the Oriental
Orthodox churches. The members of the Trinity are said to be co-equal and co-
eternal, one in essence, nature, power, action, and will. As stated in the
Athanasian Creed, the Father is uncreated, the Son is uncreated, and the Holy
Spirit is uncreated, and all three are eternal with no beginning. It has been
stated that because three persons exist in God as one unity, "The Father and
the Son and the Holy Spirit" are not three different names for different parts
of God but one name for God, because the Father can not be divided from the Son
or the Holy Spirit from the Son. God has always loved, and there has always
existed perfectly harmonious communion between the three persons of the
Trinity. One consequence of this teaching is that God could not have created
man to have "someone to talk to" or "to love": God "already" enjoyed personal
communion; being perfect, he did not create man because of a lack or inadequacy
he had. Another consequence, according to Rev. Fr. Thomas Hopko, an Eastern
Orthodox theologian, is that if God were not a Trinity, he could not have loved
prior to creating other beings on whom to bestow his love. Thus God says, "Let
"us" make man in "our" image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish
of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth,
and over all the creatures that move along the ground. So God created man in
his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created
them." For Trinitarians, emphasis in Genesis 1:26 is on the plurality in the
Deity, and in 1:27 on the unity of the divine Essence. A possible
interpretation of Genesis 1:26 is that God's relationships in the Trinity are
mirrored in man by the ideal relationship between husband and wife, two persons
becoming one flesh, as described in Eve's creation later in the next chapter.
Mutually indwelling. A useful explanation of the relationship of the distinct
divine persons is called "perichoresis", from Greek "going around",
"envelopment". This concept refers for its basis to , where Jesus is
instructing the disciples concerning the meaning of his departure. His going to
the Father, he says, is for their sake; so that he might come to them when the
"other comforter" is given to them. Then, he says, his disciples will dwell in
him, as he dwells in the Father, and the Father dwells in him, and the Father
will dwell in them. This is so, according to the theory of perichoresis,
because the persons of the Trinity "reciprocally contain one another, so that
one permanently envelopes and is permanently enveloped by, the other whom he
yet envelopes". (Hilary of Poitiers, "Concerning the Trinity" 3:1). This co-
indwelling may also be helpful in illustrating the Trinitarian conception of
salvation. The first doctrinal benefit is that it effectively excludes the idea
that God has parts. Trinitarians assert that God is a simple, not an aggregate,
being. The second doctrinal benefit is that it harmonizes well with the
doctrine that the Christian's union with the Son in his humanity brings him
into union with one who contains in himself, in St. Paul's words, "all the
fullness of deity" and not a part. ("See also: Theosis"). Perichoresis provides
an intuitive figure of what this might mean. The Son, the eternal Word, is from
all eternity the dwelling place of God; he is the "Father's house", just as the
Son dwells in the Father and the Spirit; so that, when the Spirit is "given",
then it happens as Jesus said, "I will not leave you as orphans; for I will
come to you." Some forms of human union are considered to be not identical but
analogous to the Trinitarian concept, as found for example in Jesus' words
about marriage: "For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and
cleave to his wife; And they twain shall be one flesh: so then they are no more
twain, but one flesh." According to the words of Jesus, married persons are in
some sense no longer two, but joined into one. Therefore, Orthodox theologians
also see the marriage relationship as an image, or "icon" of the Trinity,
relationships of communion in which, in the words of St. Paul, participants are
"members one of another". As with marriage, the unity of the church with Christ
is similarly considered in some sense analogous to the unity of the Trinity,
following the prayer of Jesus to the Father, for the church, that "they may be
one, even as we are one". Eternal generation and procession. Trinitarianism
affirms that the Son is "begotten" (or "generated") of the Father and that the
Spirit "proceeds" from the Father, but the Father is "neither begotten nor
proceeds". The argument over whether the Spirit proceeds from the Father alone,
or from the Father and the Son, was one of the catalysts of the Great Schism,
in this case concerning the Western addition of the Filioque clause to the
Nicene Creed. The Roman Catholic Church teaches that, in the sense of the Latin
verb "procedere" (which does not have to indicate ultimate origin and is
therefore compatible with proceeding "through"), but not in that of the Greek
verb ·ºêŒ∫œÄŒøœÅŒµœçŒµœÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ (which implies ultimate origin), the Spirit
"proceeds" from the Father and the Son (see Filioque), and the Eastern Orthodox
Church, which teaches that the Spirit "proceeds" from the Father alone, has
made no statement on the claim of a difference in meaning between the two
words, one Greek and one Latin, both of which are translated as "proceeds".
This language is often considered difficult because, if used regarding humans
or other created things, it would imply time and change; when used here, no
beginning, change in being, or process within time is intended and is excluded.
The Son is generated ("born" or "begotten"), and the Spirit proceeds,
eternally. Augustine of Hippo explains, "Thy years are one day, and Thy day is
not daily, but today; because Thy today yields not to tomorrow, for neither
does it follow yesterday. Thy today is eternity; therefore Thou begat the Co-
eternal, to whom Thou saidst, 'This day have I begotten Thee." Son begotten,
not created. Because the Son is begotten, not made, the substance of his person
is that of the deity. The creation is brought into being through the Son, but
the Son himself is not part of it except through his incarnation. The church
fathers used several analogies to express this thought. St. Irenaeus of Lyons
was the final major theologian of the 2nd century. He writes, "the Father is
God, and the Son is God, for whatever is begotten of God is God." (Compare
Spinoza's philosophy of God.) Extending the analogy, it might be said,
similarly, that whatever is generated (procreated) of humans is human. Thus,
given that humanity is, in the words of the Bible, "created in the image and
likeness of God", an analogy can be drawn between the Divine Essence and human
nature, between the Divine Persons and human persons. However, given the fall,
this analogy is far from perfect, even though, like the Divine Persons, human
persons are characterized by being "loci of relationship". For Trinitarian
Christians, this analogy is important with regard to the Church, which St. Paul
calls "the body of Christ" and whose members are, because they are "members of
Christ", also "members one of another". However, an attempt to explain the
mystery to some extent must break down, and has limited usefulness, being
designed, not so much to fully explain the Trinity, but to point to the
experience of communion with the Triune God within the church as the Body of
Christ. The difference between those who believe in the Trinity and those who
do not, is not an issue of understanding the mystery. The difference is
primarily one of belief concerning the personal identity of Christ. It is a
difference in conception of the salvation connected with Christ that drives all
reactions, either favorable or unfavorable, to the doctrine of the Holy
Trinity. As it is, the doctrine of the Trinity is directly tied up with
Christology. Economic and ontological Trinity. The ancient Nicene theologians
argued that everything the Trinity does is done by Father, Son, and Spirit
working in unity with one will. The three persons of the Trinity always work
inseparably, for their work is always the work of the one God. Because of this
unity of will, the Trinity cannot involve the eternal subordination of the Son
to the Father. Eternal subordination can only exist if the Son's will is at
least conceivably different from the Father's. But Nicene orthodoxy says it is
not. The Son's will cannot be different from the Father's because it is the
Father's. They have but one will as they have but one being. Otherwise they
would not be one God. If there were relations of command and obedience between
the Father and the Son, there would be no Trinity at all but rather three gods.
On this point St. Basil observes "When then He says, 'I have not spoken of
myself,' and again, 'As the Father said unto me, so I speak,' and 'The word
which ye hear is not mine, but Father's which sent me,' and in another place,
'As the Father gave me commandment, even so I do,' it is not because He lacks
deliberate purpose or power of initiation, nor yet because He has to wait for
the preconcerted key-note, that he employs language of this kind. His object is
to make it plain that His own will is connected in indissoluble union with the
Father. Do not then let us understand by what is called a 'commandment' a
peremptory mandate delivered by organs of speech, and giving orders to the Son,
as to a subordinate, concerning what He ought to do. Let us rather, in a sense
befitting the Godhead, perceive a transmission of will, like the reflexion of
an object in a mirror, passing without note of time from Father to Son.." In
explaining why the Bible speaks of the Son as being subordinate to the Father,
the great theologian Athanasius argued that scripture gives a "double account"
of the son of God‚Äîone of his temporal and voluntary subordination in the
incarnation, and the other of his eternal divine status. For Athanasius, the
Son is eternally one in being with the Father, temporally and voluntarily
subordinate in his incarnate ministry. Such human traits, he argued, were not
to be read back into the eternal Trinity. Like Athanasius, the Cappadocian
Fathers also insisted there was no economic inequality present within the
Trinity. As Basil wrote: "We perceive the operation of the Father, Son, and
Holy Spirit to be one and the same, in no respect showing differences or
variation; from this identity of operation we necessarily infer the unity of
nature." Augustine also rejected an economic hierarchy within the Trinity. He
claimed that the three persons of the Trinity "share the inseparable equality
one substance present in divine unity". Because the three persons are one in
their inner life, this means that for Augustine their works in the world are
one. For this reason, it is an impossibility for Augustine to speak of the
Father commanding and the Son obeying as if there could be a conflict of wills
within the eternal Trinity. John Calvin also spoke at length about the doctrine
of the Trinity. Like Athanasius and Augustine before him, he concluded that
prescribed how scripture was to be read correctly. For him the Son's obedience
is limited to the incarnation and is indicative of his true humanity assumed
for human salvation. Much of this work is summed up in the Athanasian Creed.
This creed stresses the unity of the Trinity and the equality of the persons.
It ascribes equal divinity, majesty, and authority to all three persons. All
three are said to be "almighty" and "Lord" (no subordination in authority;
"none is before or after another" (no hierarchical ordering); and "none is
greater, or less than another" (no subordination in being or nature). Thus,
since the divine persons of the Trinity act with one will, there is no
possibility of hierarchy-inequality in the Trinity. Catholic theologian Karl
Rahner went so far as to say:K. Rahner, "The Trinity" (Herder & Herder:1970)
p.22 Since the 1980s, some evangelical theologians have come to the conclusion
that the members of the Trinity may be economically unequal while remaining
ontologically equal. This theory was put forward by George W. Knight III in his
1977 book The New Testament Teaching on the Role Relationship of Men and Women,
states that the Son of God is eternally subordinated in authority to God the
Father. This conclusion was used to support the main thesis of his book: that
women are permanently subordinated in authority to their husbands in the home
and to male leaders in the church, despite being ontologically equal.
Subscribers to this theory insist that the Father has the role of giving
commands and the Son has the role of obeying them. Orthodox, Roman Catholic,
Anglican, and Protestant distinctions. The Western (Roman Catholic) tradition
is more prone to make positive statements concerning the relationship of
persons in the Trinity. Explanations of the Trinity are not the same thing as
the doctrine; nevertheless, the Augustinian West is inclined to think in
philosophical terms concerning the rationality of God's being, and is prone on
this basis to be more open than the East to seek philosophical formulations
which make the doctrine more intelligible, while recognizing that these
formulations are only analogies. Eastern Christianity, for its part, correlates
ecclesiology and Trinitarian doctrine, and seeks to understand the doctrine of
the Trinity via the experience of the Church, which it understands to be "an
icon of the Trinity". Therefore, when St. Paul writes concerning Christians
that all are "members one of another", Eastern Christians in turn understand
this as also applying to the Divine Persons. The principal disagreement between
Western and Eastern Christianity on the Trinity has been the relationship of
the Holy Spirit with the other two hypostases. The original credal formulation
of the Council of Constantinople was that the Holy Spirit proceeds "from the
Father". While this phrase is still used unaltered both in the Eastern
Churches, including the Eastern Catholic Churches, and, when the Nicene Creed
is recited in Greek, in the Latin Church, it became customary in the Latin-
speaking Church, beginning with the provincial Third Council of Toledo in 589,
to add "and the Son" (Latin "Filioque"). Although this insertion into the Creed
was explicitly vetoed by Pope Leo III, it was finally used in a Papal Mass by
Pope Benedict VIII in 1014, thus completing its spread throughout Western
Christianity. The Eastern Orthodox Churches object to it on ecclesiological and
theological grounds, holding that "from the Father" means "from the Father
alone", while in the West belief that the Holy Spirit "proceeds", in the Latin
(and English) meaning of this word, "from the Father and the Son" had already
been dogmatically declared to be orthodox faith in 447 by Pope Leo I, the Pope
whose Tome was approved at the Council of Chalcedon, and Pope Leo III, who
opposed insertion of the phrase into the Nicene Creed, "affirmed the orthodoxy
of the term "Filioque", and approved its use in catechesis and personal
professions of faith". The 1978 Anglican Lambeth Conference requested:Lambeth
Conference Resolutions from 1978. Accessed May 24, 2009. None of the member
Churches has implemented this request; but the Church of England, while keeping
the phrase in the Creed recited in its own services, presents in its Common
Worship series of service books a text of the creed without it for use "on
suitable ecumenical occasions". Most Protestant groups that use the creed also
include the Filioque clause. However, the issue is usually not controversial
among them because their conception is often less exact than is discussed above
(exceptions being the Presbyterian Westminster Confession 2:3, the London
Baptist Confession 2:3, and the Lutheran Augsburg Confession 1:1‚Äì6, which
specifically address those issues). The clause is often understood by
Protestants to mean that the Spirit is sent from the Father, by the Son, a
conception which is not controversial in either Catholicism or Eastern
Orthodoxy. A representative view of Protestant Trinitarian theology is more
difficult to provide, given the diverse and decentralized nature of the various
Protestant churches. Questions of logical coherency. In Christian tradition the
Trinity is a mystery of faith revealed in scripture, beyond human
understanding. Theological explanations thus tend to lack or avoid a logical or
philosophical foundation. In his explanation of the doctrine of the Trinity,
Augustine pointed out that Jesus spoke in similitudes and would later reveal
the Father more plainly. Despite his lengthy exposition to explain the Trinity
in light of scripture, Augustine states that an explanation is beyond human
language, and that the definition of the Trinity as three persons is but a
similitude needed in order to express it. Augustine concludes that one must
believe before one understands, and that the Trinity must remain unknown. After
this conclusion Augustine then attempted to describe analogies of the Trinity
in love itself and in the mind of man. Hilary of Poitiers stressed that as God
is infinite, eternal and omnipresent, his true nature is unfathomable, and that
"words cannot describe Him." He notes that scripture states no one knows the
Father except the Son. As to how the Son could be begotten, and yet not be
created, he admits that it is a mystery, and confesses his ignorance at
understanding it, for the Son had not yet made revelation concerning this
matter. When Jesus said that He and His Father are one, he interprets it as one
nature, but two persons. Again it is a mystery: "There cannot be one Person
only, for He speaks not of Himself; and, conversely, They cannot be separate
and divided when the One speaks through the voice of the Other. These words are
the revelation of the mystery of Their unity." Because they share one nature
the doctrine is "guiltless of ditheism." "op. cit.", Q. 30, Art. 1. How does
Aquinas answer this objection? He redefines the word "person" as "a relation
subsisting in the Divine nature." Thus properties found in God, such as
goodness and wisdom, are distinguishable, but subsist together as one. But then
Aquinas comes to the question, Why three? And, three what? To the first
question, he answers because scripture says so (quoting the dubious Comma
Johanneum), and to the second question, he answers "three persons" falling into
circular reasoning. In contrast to Joachim of Fiore's historicization of the
Trinity, there have been recent philosophical attempts to defend the logical
coherency of Trinity by men such as Peter Geach. Regarding the formulation
suggested by Geach, not all philosophers would agree with its logical
coherency. Geach suggested that "a coherent statement of the doctrine is
possible on the assumption that identity is "always relative to a sortal term".
The Canadian philosopher-theologian, Bernard Lonergan, has demonstrated by
analogy with the operations of the human subject (the psychological analogy)
the logical coherency of the Trinity. It is chiefly in his work "The Triune
God: Systematics" that he draws on his abstract phenomenology to show this
logical inner coherency in the Trinity doctrine. He sees himself as doing
nothing more than standing in the tradition of Augustine and Aquinas on this
issue and not based on the Bible. Art. The Trinity is most commonly seen in
Christian art with the Spirit represented by a dove, as specified in the Gospel
accounts of the Baptism of Christ; he is nearly always shown with wings
outspread. However depictions using three human figures appear occasionally in
most periods of art. The Father and the Son are usually differentiated by age,
and later by dress, but this too is not always the case. The usual depiction of
the Father as an older man with a white beard may derive from the biblical
Ancient of Days, which is often cited in defense of this sometimes
controversial representation. However, in Eastern Orthodoxy the Ancient of Days
is usually understood to be God the Son, not God the Father (see below)‚Äîearly
Byzantine images show Christ as the Ancient of Days, but this iconography
became rare. When the Father is depicted in art, he is sometimes shown with a
halo shaped like an equilateral triangle, instead of a circle. The Son is often
shown at the Father's right hand. He may be represented by a symbol‚Äîtypically
the Lamb or a cross‚Äîor on a crucifix, so that the Father is the only human
figure shown at full size. In early medieval art, the Father may be represented
by a hand appearing from a cloud in a blessing gesture, for example in scenes
of the Baptism of Christ. Later, in the West, the "Throne of Mercy" (or "Throne
of Grace") became a common depiction. In this style, the Father (sometimes
seated on a throne) is shown supporting either a crucifix or, later, a slumped
crucified Son, similar to the Piet√  (this type is distinguished in German as
the "Not Gottes") in his outstretched arms, while the Dove hovers above or in
between them. This subject continued to be popular until the 18th century at
least. By the end of the 15th century, larger representations, other than the
Throne of Mercy, became effectively standardised, showing an older figure in
plain robes for the Father, Christ with his torso partly bare to display the
wounds of his Passion, and the dove above or around them. In earlier
representations both Father, especially, and Son often wear elaborate robes and
crowns. Sometimes the Father alone wears a crown, or even a papal tiara.
Eastern Orthodox tradition. cf. And Isaiah the prophet says in his fortieth
chapter: "To whom have ye likened the Lord? and with what likeness have ye made
a similitude of Him? Has not the artificier of wood made an image, or the
goldsmiths, having melted gold, gilt it over, and made it a similitude?" In
like manner the Apostle Paul says in Acts "Forasmuch then as we are the
offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold or
silver or stone, graven by art of man's imagination." And John Damascene says:
"But furthermore, who can make a similitude of the invisible, incorporeal,
uncircumscribed and undepictable God? It is, then, uttermost insanity and
impiety to give a form to the Godhead" ("Orthodox Faith", 4:16). In like manner
St. Gregory the Dialogist prohibits this. For this reason we should only form
an understanding in the mind of Sabaoth, which is the Godhead, and of that
birth before the ages of the Only-Begotten-Son from the Father, but we should
never, in any wise depict these in icons, for this, indeed, is impossible. And
the Holy Spirit is not in essence a dove, but in essence he is God, and "No man
hath seen God", as John the Theologian and Evangelist bears witness and this is
so even though, at the Jordan at Christ's holy Baptism the Holy Spirit appeared
in the likeness of a dove. For this reason, it is fitting on this occasion only
to depict the Holy Spirit in the likeness of a dove. But in any other place
those who have intelligence will not depict the Holy Spirit in the likeness of
a dove. For on Mount Tabor, He appeared as a cloud and, at another time, in
other ways. Furthermore, Sabaoth is the name not only of the Father, but of the
Holy Trinity. According to Dionysios the Areopagite, Lord Sabaoth, translated
from the Jewish tongue, means "Lord of Hosts". This Lord of Hosts is the Holy
Trinity, Father, Son and Holy Spirit. And although Daniel the prophet says that
he beheld the Ancient of Days sitting on a throne, this should not be
understood to refer to the Father, but to the Son, Who at His second coming
will judge every nation at the dreadful Judgment. Oriental Orthodox traditions.
The Coptic Orthodox Church never depicts God the Father in art although he may
be identified by an area of brightness within art such as the heavenly glow at
the top of some icons of the baptism of the Lord Jesus Christ. In contrast, the
Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church has many ancient icons depicting the Holy
Trinity as three distinct Persons. These icons often depict all Three Persons
sitting upon a single throne to signify unity. The Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo
Church follows the same practice. Scenes. Only a few of the standard scenes in
Christian art normally included a representation of the Trinity. The accounts
in the Gospels of the Baptism of Christ were considered to show all three
persons as present with a separate role. Sometimes the other two persons are
shown at the top of a crucifixion. The Coronation of the Virgin, a popular
subject in the West, often included the whole Trinity. But many subjects, such
as Christ in Majesty or the Last Judgement, which might be thought to require
depiction of the deity in the most amplified form, only show Christ. There is a
rare subject where the persons of the Trinity make the decision to incarnate
Christ, or "God sending out the Son". Even more rarely, the Angel of the
Annunciation is shown being given the mission. Less common types of depiction.
Especially in the 15th century, and in the less public form of illuminated
manuscripts, there was experimentation with many solutions to the issues of
depicting the three persons of the Trinity. The depiction of the Trinity as
three "identical" persons is rare, because each Person of the Trinity is
considered to have distinct attributes. Nonetheless, the earliest known
depiction of God the Father as a human figure, on the 4th century Dogmatic
Sarcophagus, shows the Trinity as three similar bearded men creating Eve from
Adam, probably with the intention of affirming the consubstantiality recently
made dogma in the Nicene Creed. There are many similar sarcophagi, and
occasional images at intervals until a revival of the iconography in the 15th
century. Even rarer is the depiction of the Trinity as a single anthropoid
figure with three faces (Latin "Vultus Trifrons"), because the Trinity is
defined as three persons in one Godhead, not one Person with three attributes
(this would imply Modalism, which is defined as heresy in traditional Christian
orthodoxy). Such "Cerberus" depictions of the Trinity as three faces on one
head were mainly made among Catholics during the 15th to 17th centuries, but
were condemned after the Catholic Council of Trent, and again by Pope Urban
VIII in 1628, and many existing images were destroyed. The Trinity may also be
represented abstractly by symbols, such as the triangle (or three triangles
joined together), trefoil or the triquetra‚Äîor a combination of these.
Sometimes a halo is incorporated into these symbols. The use of such symbols
are often found not only in painting but also in needlework on tapestries,
vestments and antependia, in metalwork and in architectural details. Gallery.

www.ucanews.com/diocesan-directory/html/dps-pr_malolos_parish.html].  Non-
orthodoxy. Non-orthodox views of the Christian trinitarian God have also been
suggested by process theologians like Lewis S. Ford, who endorse the entitative
view of God as timeless and eternal concrescence, but interpret the
Whiteheadian natures of God (primordial nature, consequent nature, and
superjective nature) in a trinitarian way. Other process theologians like
Joseph A. Bracken consider the three divines persons, each understood in the
Neo-Whiteheadian societal view of God sensu Charles Hartshorne and David Ray
Griffin, as constituting a primordial field of divine activity.
Nontrinitarianism. Some Christian traditions either reject the doctrine of the
Trinity or consider it unimportant. Persons and groups espousing this position
generally do not refer to themselves as "Nontrinitarians". They can vary in
both their reasons for rejecting traditional teaching on the Trinity, and in
the way they describe God. Groups. History. Since Trinitarianism is central to
so much of Catholic and Orthodox church doctrine, Christian nontrinitarians
were mostly groups that existed before the Nicene Creed was codified in 325 or
are groups that developed after the Protestant Reformation, when many church
doctrines came into question. In the early centuries of Christian history
Adoptionists, Arians, Ebionites, some Gnostics, Marcionites, and others held
nontrinitarian beliefs. The Council of Nicaea professed the divinity of Jesus,
and the Council of Chalcedon made a declaration on the issue of the
relationship between Jesus' divine and human natures, against Monophysitism
("one nature only"), a belief that did not deny his divinity. Miaphysitism
("one nature") and monothelitism ("one will") were other attempts to explain
this relationship, while upholding Trinitarianism. During more than a thousand
years of Trinitarian orthodoxy, formal nontrinitarianism, i.e., a doctrine held
by a church, group, or movement, was rare, existing, for example, as a belief
among the Cathars, a Christian dualist heresy in W. Europe in the 13th‚Äì14th
centuries. The Cathars were a serious threat to the authority of the Catholic
Church especially in southern France Albigenses and northern Italy, until they
were suppressed. They were forced into secrecy by a war between the nobles of
the north and south of France, the northern nobles were supported by a crusade
authorized by the Catholic Church. The Protestant Reformation of the 16th
century also brought tradition into question. At first, nontrinitarians were
executed (such as Servetus), or forced to keep their beliefs secret (such as
Isaac Newton). The eventual establishment of religious freedom, however,
allowed nontrinitarians to more easily preach their beliefs, and the 19th
century saw the establishment of several nontrinitarian groups in North America
and elsewhere. These include the Church of God (7th day) ‚Äì Salem Conference,
the Christadelphians, the Jehovah's Witnesses, and Unitarians groups. Some
Messianic groups are also nontrinitarian. Servetus heavily influenced the
theology of Emanuel Swedenborg; the church founded on his writings is a small
but influential nontrinitarian movement. Some groups espousing Binitarianism
such as the Living Church of God claim that Binitarianism was the majority view
of those that professed Christ in the 2nd century. 20th century nontrinitarian
movements include Iglesia ni Cristo, Most Holy Church of God in Christ Jesus,
and the Unification Church. Nontrinitarian groups differ from one another in
their views of Jesus Christ, depicting him variously as a divine being second
only to God the Father (e.g., Jehovah's Witnesses), as Yahweh of the Old
Testament in human form (Modalism), as God (but not eternally God), as Son of
God but inferior to the Father (versus co-equal), as a prophet, or simply as a
holy man. Modalism. Footnote in the cited text him all things were created, in
heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or
rulers or authorities; all things were created through him and for him. And he
is before all things, and in him all things hold together. And he is the head
of the body, the church. He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that
in everything he might be preeminent. For in him all the fullness of God was
pleased to dwell, and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether
on earth or in heaven, making peace by the blood of his cross. Jesus answered:
"Don't you know me, Philip, even after I have been among you such a long time?
Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, 'Show us the
Father'? A notable modern adherent of Modalism is T.D. Jakes Baptismal formula.
When criticized by Trinitarian believers who cite the Great Commission in as
being the biblical affirmation of "in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy
Spirit" baptismal formula, Oneness adherents point to the singular sense of
that phrase, and argue that if the passage was really supporting what the
Trinitarians propose, it would have said the "Names" in the plural instead of
""Name"". Oneness Scholars then state that the passage is referring to "The
Name", in other words, "Jesus", and they point to passages like as being the
correct baptismal formula. Oneness believers view "Father", "Son" and "Holy
Spirit" as "titles" or "forms", reflecting different manifestations of the one
true God. Apostolic Christians also point out that there is no passage that
appears to confirm Matthew 28:19 as being the correct baptismal formula (going
against the scriptural requirement of "two witnesses" to establish a verdict),
while all the other passages in the Gospels and Acts point to "in the Name of
Jesus" as the correct form. They also state that Jesus was not only referencing
Water Baptism, but also the long term "baptism in thought, word, and deed" (2
Corinthians 10:5 and ) that all believers undergo as they mature in the Word.
Unitarianism. Unitarianism is a form of Christian theology holding that God is
only one person, in contrast to the doctrine of the Trinity (God as three
persons in one), and that God is a separate being from Jesus Christ. It is a
specific type of nontrinitarian theology and resembles strictly monotheistic
conceptions of God upheld in Judaism and Islam. Some confusion has resulted
because the term "unitarianism" (uncapitalized) has sometimes been used
informally to describe any Christology (i.e., understanding of Jesus Christ)
that denies the Trinity or believes that only the Father of Jesus (and not
Jesus himself) is God. Mere denial of the Trinity, however, is more commonly
called nontrinitarianism. Recently some religious groups have adopted the term
"biblical unitarianism" to describe their theology, but they hold to a
conservative form of nontrinitarianism, which rejects many of the teachings of
liberal Unitarianism. So, too, Unitarianism does not accept the Godhood of
Jesus, and therefore does not include Modalist belief systems which do‚Äîfor
example, Oneness Pentecostalism, United Pentecostal Church International and
the True Jesus Church‚Äîthat maintain that Jesus is God as a single person.
Binitarianism. George Johnson, a proponent of Binitarianism, argues that Jesus
is the God of the Old Testament, distinct from the God who is called the
Ancient of Days in , and that the Holy Spirit is not a person. Islam. Zia H.
Shah, a Muslim, interprets the Christian doctrine of the Trinity as saying that
"the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are three complete and separate Gods and are
yet one at the same time", a thought that he describes as absurd and
incompatible with monotheism. Al-Quran says: Surely, disbelievers are those who
said: "Allah is the third of the three (in a Trinity)." But there is no Allah
(god) (none who has the right to be worshipped) but One Allah (God -Allah). And
if they cease not from what they say, verily, a painful torment will befall on
the disbelievers among them. Judaism. Cher-El L. Hagensick says that the
Trinity doctrine owes more of its Triune philosophy to pagan Egyptian and Stoic
sources, and that the word Trinity was formulated 100 years after the
crucifixion by Tertullian: "The word ‚Äòtrinity‚Äô was not coined until
Tertullian, more than 100 years "after" Christ's death, and the key words
(meaning substance) from the Nicene debate, homousia and ousia, are not
biblical, but from Stoic thought. Nowhere in the Bible is the Trinity
mentioned." In other words, the writer says, the early church began to slowly
include pagan Greek philosophy that was not taught in the Bible. Scholars also
criticize efforts to introduce plurality into God's names in the Old Testament:
"Enough has been said to show that a great majority of the most learned authors
in the ‚Äòorthodox‚Äô body who have treated of the subject acknowledge that the
argument drawn from the plural forms of Hebrew nouns applied to Deity are
totally invalid, in support either of a Trinity or any plurality of Persons in
the Godhead. To deduce a plurality in God from a Hebrew idiom is impossible.
The argument for plurality in God seems never to have been thought of before
the time of Peter Lombard, a puerile writer who lived in the twelfth century"-
John Wilson Mormonism. In Mormonism, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are three
individual members of a heavenly council, perfectly united in purpose and will,
but nevertheless separate and distinct individuals, a view sometimes called
social trinitarianism. An April 1830 revelation to Joseph Smith, for instance,
affirms that they "are one God, infinite and eternal, without end". This belief
that God the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost are physically distinct beings
is in contrast to most denominations of Christianity which continue to uphold
the doctrine of the relationship of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost in
the terms recorded in creeds, such as the Nicene Creed, which were formulated
as part of the Arian controversy. Mormons claim to draw their understanding of
the Godhead from teachings of the Bible, but also draw from teachings of the
Book of Mormon and revelations given to modern prophets and apostles. One of
the most influential accounts of the Godhead comes from the prophet Joseph
Smith, Jr., who claimed to have actually seen God the Father and Jesus Christ
in his First Vision, and recounted seeing "two personages", one of which
referred to the other as His "Beloved Son." Still, Mormons do cite Biblical
script to support their position that God the Father, Jesus Christ and the Holy
Ghost are actually three distinct beings. Daniel C. Peterson of Brigham Young
University states that "uniquely Mormon scriptural texts assert the unity of
Father, Son and Holy Ghost at least as strongly as the Bible does." Jehovah's
Witnesses. Jehovah's Witnesses reject trinitarianism. According to their
belief, Jehovah is the only true God, and Jesus Christ is the son of Jehovah.
The holy spirit is considered to be God's active force and not a person.
Christian Science. Christian Science explicitly denies the deity of Jesus and
has therefore always been non-Trinitarian, for which reason the term is of
little significance within its core texts, though Mary Baker Eddy did adopt it
on occasion for discussion of a wider spiritual unity with God which
characterized "all" mankind rather than Jesus alone, as in her statement that
"The Trinity in Christian Science is found in the unity of God, Christ, and the
Holy Ghost or‚Äî"God the Father-Mother; Christ the spiritual idea of sonship;
divine Science or the Holy Comforter." Its elements thus united but distinct in
essential identity, this Trinity indicated "the intelligent relation of God to
man and the universe".
