Tallit A tallit () (talet in Sephardic Hebrew and Ladino) (tallis, in
Ashkenazic Hebrew and Yiddish) pl. tallitot (talleisim, tallism, in Ashkenazic
Hebrew and Yiddish) is a Jewish prayer shawl. The tallit is worn over the outer
clothes during the morning prayers (Shacharit) and worn during all prayers on
Yom Kippur. The tallit has special twined and knotted fringes known as
"tzitzit" attached to its four corners. Most traditional tallitot are made of
wool. Tallitot are often first worn by children on their Bar Mitzvahs. In
orthodox, Ashkenazi circles, a Tallit is customarily presented to a groom
before marriage as part of the dowry. Biblical commandment. The Bible does not
command wearing of a unique prayer shawl or tallit. Instead, it presumes that
people wore a garment of some type to cover themselves and instructs them to
add fringes (tzitzit) to the 4 corners of these (Numbers 15:38, Deuteronomy 22:
12). These passages do not specify tying particular types or numbers of knots
in the fringes. Nor do they specify a gender division between men and women, or
between native Israelite/Hebrew people and those assimilated by them. The exact
customs regarding the tying of the tzitzit and the format of the tallit are
post-Biblical and rabbinical and can vary between various Jewish communities.
Encyclopaedia Judaica, describes the prayer shawl as "a rectangular mantle that
looked like a blanket and was worn by men in ancient times". Also, it "is
usually white and made either of wool, cotton, or silk". The tallit can be made
of any materials except a mixture of wool and linen. Usually, the mixture of
wool and linen - a combination known as shatnez - is specifically forbidden by
the Torah. In the case of Talit however, this is a Rabbinic prohibition,
because biblically, the mixture might be allowed for a Talit during the daytime
(however at nighttime there would be a transgression on behalf of the wearer).
Most traditional tallitot are made of wool. According to the biblical
commandment, a blue (Hebrew ◊™◊õ◊ú◊™, tekhelet, t…ôk¬∑ƒÅ'¬∑leth) thread (Hebrew
◊§◊™◊ô◊ú "p…ôthiyl") known as "tekhelet" itself, is included in the tzitzit.
Pronunciation. In Modern Hebrew the word is pronounced , with the stress on the
final syllable. In Yiddish it is , with the stress on the first syllable. The
plural of "tallit" in Hebrew is "tallitot", pronounced . The Yiddish plural is
"taleisim," pronounced . Etymology and origin. Tallit is an Aramaic word from
the root tll ◊ò◊ú◊ú meaning cover. Tallit literally means cloak or sheet but in
Talmudic times already referred to the Jewish prayer shawl. The tallit is
similar to the Roman pallium worn today by senior Roman Catholic priests, the
Roman toga and the Arab keffiyeh. The tallit or other similar garment is
suitable for the climate in West Asia: typically the days are hot and the
tallit can be draped around the body and head to provide cover from the sun or
just bunched up on the shoulders for later evening use; the evenings can be
dramatically cool and the tallit could be draped around the neck and shoulders
like a scarf to provide warmth. Customs. In some Jewish communities a tallit is
given as a gift by a father to a son, a father-in-law to a son-in-law, or a
teacher to a student. It might be purchased to mark a special occasion, such as
a wedding or a bar/bat mitzvah. Many parents purchase a tallit for their
children at the age of 13, together with tefillin. In the egalitarian, Reform
and Conservative movements, it is common for both men and women to wear a
tallit. While many worshipers bring their own tallit to synagogue, there is
usually a rack of shawls for the use of visitors and guests. At Jewish wedding
ceremonies, a tallit is often used as a "chuppah" or wedding canopy. The tallit
is traditionally draped over the shoulders, but during prayer, some cover their
head with it. In the Talmudic and post-Talmudic periods the tefillin were worn
by rabbis and scholars all day, and a special tallit was worn at prayer; hence
they put on the tefillin before the tallit, as appears in the order given in
"Seder Rabbi Amram Gaon" (p.¬ 2a) and in the Zohar. In modern practice, the
opposite order is considered more "correct". Based on the Talmudic principle of
"tadir v'she'ayno tadir, tadir kodem" (◊™◊ì◊ô◊® ◊ï◊©◊ê◊ô◊ ◊ï ◊™◊ì◊ô◊®, ◊™◊ì◊ô◊®
◊ß◊ï◊ì◊ù: lit., frequent and infrequent, frequent first), when one performs
more than one mitzva at a time, those that are performed more frequently should
be performed first. While the tallit is worn daily, tefillin are not worn on
"Shabbat" and holidays. The Kabbalists considered the tallit as a special
garment for the service of God, intended, in connection with the tefillin, to
inspire awe and reverence for God at prayer. The tallit is worn by worshipers
at the morning prayer on weekdays, "Shabbat", and holy days; by the hazzan
(cantor) at every prayer while before the ark; and by the reader of Torah, as
well as by all other functionaries during the Torah service. History. The use
of the tallit begins in the Biblical period around 1800 BCE. The ancient Jewish
tallit design was different than that known today. Originally it was a large
white rectangular garment with tzitzyot in each corner and was used as a
garment, bed sheet, and burial shroud. In the book "The Ancient Jewish Shroud
At Turin" by John N. Lupia (Regina Caeli Press, 2010; ISBN 978-0-9826739-0-4)
Lupia shows the historical development of the tallit when its design began to
change during the second half of the first century CE and began to take on the
forms known today beginning around 1000 CE. The long tradition of a single
orthodox form of the tallit became modified in a more culturally diverse
atmosphere and continued to change throughout time until it became permuted and
shortened in length as the kitel, tallit katan, tallit gadol, and the more
common tallit prayer shawl form know today. Weddings. In many Sephardic
communities, the groom traditionally wears a tallit under the chuppah (wedding
canopy). In Ashkenazi communities, a more widespread custom is that the groom
wears a kittel. Burials. In the Diaspora, Jews are buried in a plain, wooden
casket. The corpse is collected from the place of death (home, hospital, etc.)
by the "chevra kadisha" (burial committee). After a ritual washing of the body,
the body of men is dressed in a "kittel" and then a "tallit". One of the
"tzitzit" is then cut off. In the Land of Israel, burial is without a casket,
and the "kittel" and "tallit" are the only coverings for the corpse. Women are
buried in white shrouds only. Additional occasions. In addition to the morning
prayers of weekdays, Shabbat and holidays, a tallit is also worn for "Selichos"
in Ashkenazic communities by the prayer leader, even though it is still night.
A tallit is also worn at night on Yom Kippur, from Kol Nidre, which begins
during the daylight hours until after the evening (Ma'ariv) service. Types of
tallitot. Tallit katan. The tallit katan ("small tallit") is a fringed garment
traditionally worn either under or over one‚Äôs clothing by Jewish males. It is
a poncho-like garment with a hole for the head and special twined and knotted
fringes known as tzitzit attached to its four corners. The requirements
regarding the fabric and fringes of a "tallit katan" are the same as that of a
"tallit gadol". Generally a "tallit katan" is made of wool or cotton. Although
Sephardi halakha generally maintains a distinct preference for a woolen garment
as per the ruling of the Shulchan Aruch, among Ashkenazim customs are split,
with the Rema ruling that all garment types are acceptable. Whilst the Mishnah
Berurah and Rabbi Moshe Feinstein recommend wearing a woolen garment in
accordance with the Shulchan Aruch's ruling, the Chazon Ish was known to wear
cotton, in accordance with the ruling of the Vilna Gaon. This was also the
practice of Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik, and that of German Jewry historically.
While all four cornered garments are required to have "tzitzit", the custom of
specially wearing a "tallit katan" is based on a verse in which exhorts Jews to
"rememberof all the commandments of the Lord." Wearing a "tallit kattan" is not
mandated in Biblical law, but in Rabbinic law the practice is strongly
encouraged for men, and often considered obligatory or a binding custom. The
tallit katan is also known as "arba kanfot" (Yiddish/Ashkenazic Hebrew: "arba
kanfos"), literally "four corners" or "tzitzit". Tallit gadol. The "tallit
gadol" (traditionally known as "tall√©t gedolah" amongst Sephardim), or "large"
"tallit", is worn over one's clothing resting on the shoulders. This is the
"prayer shawl" that is worn during the morning services in synagogue by all
male participants, and in many communities by the leader of the afternoon and
evening prayers as well. The "tallit gadol" is usually woven of wool ‚Äî
especially amongst Ashkenazim. Some Spanish and Portuguese Jews use silk
"tallitot". The Portuguese Jewish community in The Netherlands has the
tradition of decorating the corners of the Tallit. Today some tallitot are made
of polyester and cotton. "Tallitot" may be of any colour but are usually white
with black, blue or white stripes along the edge. Sizes of tallitot vary, and
are a matter of custom and preference. Some are large enough to cover the whole
body while others hang around the shoulders, the former being more common
amongst Orthodox Jews, the latter among Conservative, Reform and other
denominations. The neckband of the tallit, sometimes woven of silver or gold
thread, is called the "atarah". The "tallit gadol" is often kept in a dedicated
pouch or cloth bag, which can be quite simple or ornately decorated. The tallit
gadol is typically either all white, white with black stripes, white with blue
stripes, or white with twelve-colored stripes. The all-white and black-and-
white varieties have traditionally been the commonest, with the blue-and-white
variety becoming increasingly prevalent in recent years among non-Orthodox Jews
on account of the association of blue and white with the State of Israel. The
all-white variety is customary among Sepharadic communities, whereas among
Ashkenazic communities the tendency is toward white tallitot with black
stripes. One explanation for the significance of the black stripes is that
their black color symbolizes the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem and the
exile of the Jews from the land of Israel. In many Jewish communities, the
tallit is worn in the synagogue by all men and boys over bar mitzvah age (and
in some communities even younger). Aside from German Jews and Oberlander Jews,
men in most Ashkenazi communities (which comprise the majority of Jews today)
start wearing the tallit after their wedding. Women. According to the Talmud,
and subsequently modern non-egalitarian denominations (Orthodox), Women are not
obligated to wear a "tallit", since they are not bound to perform positive
mitzvot which are time-specific, and the obligation to wear a "tallit" only
applies by day. Many early authorities did permit women to wear a "tallit",
such as Isaac ibn Ghiyyat (b. 1038), Rashi (1040‚Äì1105), Rabbeinu Tam (ca
1100‚Äì1171), Zerachya ben Yitzhak Halevi of Lunel (ca. 1125‚Äì1186), Rambam
(1135‚Äì1204), Rabbi Eliezer ben Yoel Halevi (ca 1140‚Äìca 1225), Rashba
(1235‚Äì1310), Aharon Halevi of Barcelona (b. ca 1235?), Rabbi Yisrael Yaaqob
Alghazi (1680‚Äì1761), Rabbi Yomtob ben Yisrael Alghazi (1726‚Äì1802)). There
was, however, a gradual movement towards prohibition, mainly initiated by the
Medieval Ashkenazi Rabbi Meir of Rothenburg (the "Maharam"). The "Rema" states
that while women are technically allowed to don a "tallit" it would appear to
be an act of arrogance ("yuhara") for women to perform this commandment). The
Maharil and the Targum Yonatan Ben Uziel both view a talit as a ‚Äúmale
garment‚Äù and thus find that a woman wearing a talit to be in violation of the
precept prohibiting a woman from wearing a man‚Äôs garment. In contemporary
Orthodox Judaism, there is a debate on the appropriateness of women wearing
tzitzit which has hinged on whether women are allowed to perform commandments
from which they are exempt. According to Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik the issue
depends on the intention with which such an act is undertaken, e.g. whether it
is intended to fulfill the actual commandment, to bring a person closer to the
Almighty, or for political or protest purposes. Other commentators hold that
women are prohibited generally, without making an individual inquiry. The view
that women donning a "tallit" would be guilty of arrogance is cited as applying
to attempts of making a political statement as to the ritual status of the
genders, particularly in the Modern Orthodox community, are generally more
inclined to regard contemporary women's intentions as religiously appropriate.
Rabbi Moshe Feinstein wrote that permission is granted to every woman who
wishes to fulfil even those "mitzvot" which the Torah did not obligate; and
they indeed fulfil a mitzvah and receive the reward for the fulfilment of it
including saying the appropriate associated blessing (as with "shofar", "lulav"
etc.). And also "tzitzit" are applicable for a woman who desires to wear a four
cornered garment - it should be different than a man‚Äôs garment - and by
attaching "tzitzit", she fulfils this "mitzvah". Rabbi Yisrael Yaaqob Alghazi
and Rabbi Yomtob ben Yisrael Alghazi held that the observance of this mitzvah
by women was not only permitted but actually commendable, since such diligence
amongst the non-obligated would inspire these women's male relatives to be even
more diligent in their own observance . Women in egalitarian movements (Reform,
Conservative, Reconstructionist and others) are not prohibited from wearing a
tallit, and usually encouraged to do so. Some will receive a tallit as a Bat
Mitzvah gift.
