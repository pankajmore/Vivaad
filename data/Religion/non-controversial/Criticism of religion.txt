Criticism of religion Criticism of religion is criticism of the concepts,
doctrines, validity, and/or practices of religion, including associated
political and social implications. Religious criticism has a long history. It
goes at least as far back as the 5th century BCE in ancient Greece with
Diagoras "the atheist" of Melos, and the 1st century BCE in ancient Rome with
Titus Lucretius Carus' "De Rerum Natura". It continues to the present day with
the advent of New Atheism, represented by authors and journalists such as Sam
Harris, Daniel Dennett, Richard Dawkins, Victor J. Stenger, and the late
Christopher Hitchens. Alternatively, "religious criticism" has been used by the
literary critic Harold Bloom to describe a mode of religious discussion that is
secular but not inherently anti-religion. Criticism of religion is complicated
by the fact that there exist multiple definitions and concepts of religion in
different cultures and languages. With the existence of diverse categories of
religion such as monotheism, polytheism, pantheism, nontheism and diverse
specific religions such as Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Taoism, Buddhism, and
many others; it is not always clear to whom the criticisms are aimed at or to
what extent they are applicable to other religions. Critics often consider
religion to be outdated, harmful to the individual, harmful to society, an
impediment to the progress of science, encouraging of immoral acts or customs,
and a political tool of social control. History. The 1st century BCE Roman
poet, Titus Lucretius Carus, in his work "De Rerum Natura", wrote: "But 'tis
that same religion oftener far / Hath bred the foul impieties of men:" A
philosopher of the Epicurean school, Lucretius believed the world was composed
solely of matter and void, and that all phenomena could be understood as
resulting from purely natural causes. Lucretius, like Epicurus, felt that
religion was born of fear and ignorance, and that understanding the natural
world would free people of its shackles; however, he did believe in gods. He
was not against religion in and of itself, but against traditional religion
which he saw as superstition for teaching that gods interfered with the world.
NiccolÃ² Machiavelli, at the beginning of the 16th century said: "We Italians
are irreligious and corrupt above others... because the church and her
representatives have set us the worst example." To Machiavelli, religion was
merely a tool, useful for a ruler wishing to manipulate public opinion. In the
18th century Voltaire was a deist and was strongly critical of religious
intolerance. Voltaire complained about Jews killed by other Jews for worshiping
a golden calf and similar actions, he also condemned how Christians killed
other Christians over religious differences and how Christians killed Native
Americans for not being baptised. Voltaire claimed the real reason for these
killings was that Christians wanted to plunder the wealth of those killed.
Voltaire was also critical of Muslim intolerance. Also in the 18th century
David Hume criticised teleological arguments for religion. Hume claimed that
natural explanations for the order in the universe were reasonable, see Design
argument. Demonstrating the unsoundness of the philosophical basis for religion
was an important aim of Hume's writings. Recent times. In the early 21st
century the New Atheists, Sam Harris, Daniel Dennett, Richard Dawkins and
Christopher Hitchens, were prominent as critics of religion. In the opinion of
Austin Cline, criticism of religion from atheists is very unwelcome while
comparable defense of religion by others is more tolerated. Cline believes this
defensiveness happens because wider awareness of criticisms might cause a
greater decrease in religious beliefs than has already occurred. Criticism of
religious concepts. Counterarguments against assumed conflict between the
sciences and religions have been offered. For example, C. S. Lewis, a
Christian, suggested that all religions, by definition, involve faith, or a
belief in concepts that cannot be proven or disproven by the sciences. However,
some religious beliefs have not been in line with views of the scientific
community, for instance Young Earth creationism. Though some who criticize
religions subscribe to the conflict thesis, others do not. For example, Stephen
Jay Gould agrees with C. S. Lewis and suggested that religion and science were
non-overlapping magisteria. Scientist Richard Dawkins has said that religious
practitioners often do not believe in the view of non-overlapping magisteria
(NOMA). Conflicting claims of "one true faith". In the context of theistic
belief, Stephen Roberts has claimed that he dismisses all gods in the same way
others dismiss all other gods. Survey research from the US indicates that many
people change their religious affiliation over time. Those with no religious
affiliation are the fastest growing group. However, this group has a relatively
low retention rate (46%) when compared to other groups. Such data suggest that
significant numbers of people do not believe consistently that a single faith
is uniquely true. Lack of permanence. Opsopaus and Hitchens note obsolete
religions â€” which no longer have active adherents â€” are evidence that
religions are not everlasting. Including Greek mythology, Millerism, Roman
mythology, Sabbatai Sevi, and Norse mythology. The short work "The Syrian
Goddess" by the ancient author Lucian of Samosata provides many examples of
once thriving religions that had gone out of existence. Explanations as non-
divine in origin. Social construct. Dennett, Harris, and Hitchens, assert that
theist religions and their scriptures are not divinely inspired, but man made
to fulfill social, biological, and political needs. Dawkins balances the
benefits of religious beliefs (mental solace, community-building, promotion of
virtuous behavior) against the drawbacks. Such criticisms treat religion as a
social construct and thus just another human ideology. Narratives to provide
comfort and meaning. Daniel Dennett has argued that, with the exception of more
modern religions such as RaÃ«lism, Mormonism, Scientology, and the BahÃ¡'Ã­
Faith, most religions were formulated at a time when the origin of life, the
workings of the body, and the nature of the stars and planets were poorly
understood. These narratives were intended to give solace and a sense of
relationship with larger forces. As such, they may have served several
important functions in ancient societies. Examples include the views many
religions traditionally had towards solar and lunar eclipses, and the
appearance of comets (forms of astrology). Given current understanding of the
physical world, where human knowledge has increased dramatically; Hitchens,
Dawkins, and Onfray contend that continuing to hold on to these belief systems
is irrational and no longer useful. Opium of the people. According to Karl
Marx, religion is a tool utilized by the ruling classes whereby the masses can
shortly relieve their suffering via the act of experiencing religious emotions.
It is in the interest of the ruling classes to instill in the masses the
religious conviction that their current suffering will lead to eventual
happiness. Therefore as long as the public believes in religion, they will not
attempt to make any genuine effort to understand and overcome the real source
of their suffering, which in Marx's opinion was their capitalist economic
system. In this perspective, Marx saw religion as escapism. Marx also viewed
the Christian doctrine of original sin as being deeply anti-social in
character. Original sin, he argued, convinces people that the source of their
misery lies in the inherent and unchangeable "sinfulness" of humanity rather
than in the forms of social organization and institutions, which, Marx argued,
can be changed through the application of collective social planning. Viruses
of the mind. In his 1976 book "The Selfish Gene", Richard Dawkins coined the
term memes to describe informational units that can be transmitted culturally,
analogous to genes. He later used this concept in the essay "Viruses of the
Mind" to explain the persistence of religious ideas in human culture. John
Bowker criticized the idea that "God" and "Faith" are viruses of the mind,
suggesting that Dawkins' "account of religious motivation ... is ... far
removed from evidence and data" and that, even if the God-meme approach were
valid, "it does not give rise to one set of consequences ... Out of the many
behaviours it produces, why are we required to isolate only those that might be
regarded as diseased?" Alister McGrath has responded by arguing that "memes
have no place in serious scientific reflection", that there is strong evidence
that such ideas are not spread by random processes, but by deliberate
intentional actions, that "evolution" of ideas is more Lamarckian than
Darwinian, and that there is no evidence (and certainly none in the essay) that
epidemiological models usefully explain the spread of religious ideas. McGrath
also cites a metareview of 100 studies and argues that "f religion is reported
as having a positive effect on human well-being by 79% of recent studies in the
field, how can it conceivably be regarded as analogous to a virus?" Mental
illness or delusion. Richard Dawkins argues that religious belief often
involves delusional behavior. Others such as Sam Harris compares religion to
mental illness, saying it "allows otherwise normal human beings to reap the
fruits of madness and consider them "holy"." There are also psychological
studies into the phenomenon of mysticism, and the links between disturbing
aspects of certain mystic's experiences and their links to childhood abuse. In
another line of research, Clifford A. Pickover explores evidence suggesting
that temporal lobe epilepsy may be linked to a variety of spiritual or â€˜other
worldlyâ€™ experiences, such as spiritual possession, originating from altered
electrical activity in the brain. Carl Sagan, in his last book "The Demon-
Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark", presented his case for the
miraculous sightings of religious figures in the past and the modern sightings
of UFOs coming from the same mental disorder. According to Vilayanur S.
Ramachandran, "It's possible that many great religious leaders had temporal
lobe seizures and this predisposes them to having visions, having mystical
experiences." Michael Persinger stimulated the temporal lobes of the brain
artificially with a magnetic field using a device nicknamed the "God helmet,"
and was able to artificially induce religious experiences along with near-death
experiences and ghost sightings. John Bradshaw has stated, "Some forms of
temporal lobe tumours or epilepsy are associated with extreme religiosity.
Recent brain imaging of devotees engaging in prayer or transcendental
meditation has more precisely identified activation in such sitesÂ â€” God-
spots, as Vilayanur Ramachandran calls them. Psilocybin from mushrooms contacts
the serotonergic system, with terminals in these and other brain regions,
generating a sense of cosmic unity, transcendental meaning and religious
ecstasy. Certain physical rituals can generate both these feelings and
corresponding serotonergic activity." Keith Ward in his book "Is Religion
Dangerous?" addresses the claim that religious belief is a delusion. He quotes
the definition in the "Oxford Companion to Mind" as "a fixed, idiosyncratic
belief, unusual in the culture to which the person belongs," and notes that
"all false opinions are delusions." Ward then characterizes a delusion as a
"clearly false opinion, especially as a symptom of a mental illness," an
"irrational belief" that is "so obviously false that all reasonable people
would see it as mistaken." He then says that belief in God is different, since
"[most great philosophers have believed in God, and they are rational people".
He argues that "ll that is needed to refute the claim that religious belief is
a delusion is one clear example of someone who exhibits a high degree of
rational ability, who functions well in the ordinary affairs of life ... and
who can produce a reasonable and coherent defense of their beliefs" and claims
that there are many such people, "including some of the most able philosophers
and scientists in the world today." Immature stage of societal development.
Philosopher Auguste Comte posited that many societal constructs pass through
three stages, and that religion corresponds to the two earlier, or more
primitive stages by stating: "From the study of the development of human
intelligence, in all directions, and through all times, the discovery arises of
a great fundamental law, to which it is necessarily subject, and which has a
solid foundation of proof, both in the facts of our organization and in our
historical experience. The law is this: that each of our leading conceptions
â€“ each branch of our knowledge â€“ passes successively through three
different theoretical conditions: the theological, or fictitious; the
metaphysical, or abstract; and the scientific, or positive." Harm to
individuals. Some have criticized the effects of adherence to dangerous
practices such self-sacrifice, as well as unnatural restrictions on human
behavior (such as teetotalism and sexual prohibitions) and claim that these
result in mental and emotional trauma of fear and guilt. Indoctrination of
children. Dawkins states that he is angered by the labels "Muslim child" or
"Catholic child". He asks how a young child can be considered intellectually
mature enough to have such independent views on the cosmos and humanityâ€™s
place within it. By contrast, Dawkins points out, no reasonable person would
speak of a "Marxist child" or a "Tory child". He suggests there is little
controversy over such labeling because of the "weirdly privileged status of
religion". On several occasions Dawkins has also made the controversial claim
that sexually abusing a child is "arguably less" damaging than "the long term
psychological damage inflicted by bringing up a child Catholic in the first
place". This claim was later rebutted by Theodore Beale who wrote that Dawkins
"first provides anecdotal information from one woman who was raised Catholic,
was sexually abused by a priest, and later had nightmares about Hell...Despite
posing the proposition as a comparison, Dawkins does not bother to consider
what, if any, the negative effects of childhood sexual trauma might happen to
be" and notes that "half" of the anecdotes Dawkins cites in favour of his case
"aren't even related to Catholicism". Beale cites several studies that
attribute suicide to childhood sexual abuse rather than to religion. Beale also
cites studies that conclude that religiousity correlates with better mental
health and less likelihood of suicide. Beale concludes that "hile there is no
evidence that being raised Catholic is more psychologically damaging than being
sexually abused as a child, there is a great deal of evidence proving the
opposite." Child marriage. Islam has permitted the child marriage of older men
to girls as young as 10 years of age. Baptist pastor Jerry Vines has cited the
age of one of Muhammad's wives, Aisha, to denounce him for having had sex with
a nine year old, referring to Muhammad as a pedophile. The Seyaj Organization
for the Protection of Children describes cases of a 10 year old girl being
married and raped in Yemen (Nujood Ali), a 13 year old Yemeni girl dying of
internal bleeding three days after marriage, and a 12 year old girl dying in
childbirth after marriage. Latter Day Saint church founder Joseph Smith married
girls as young as 13 and 14, and other Latter Day Saints married girls as young
as 10. The The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints eliminated underaged
marriages in the 19th century, but several branches of Mormonism continue the
practice. Inadequate medical care. A detailed study in 1998 found 140 instances
of deaths of children due to religion-based medical neglect. Most of these
cases involved religious parents relying on prayer to cure the child's disease,
and withholding medical care. Jerusalem syndrome. Jerusalem has lent its name
to a unique psychological phenomenon where Jewish or Christian individuals who
develop obsessive religious themed ideas or delusions (sometimes believing
themselves to be Jesus Christ or another prophet) will feel compelled to travel
to Jerusalem. During a period of 13 years (1980â€“1993) for which admissions to
the Kfar Shaul Mental Health Centre in Jerusalem were analyzed, it was reported
that 1,200 tourists with severe, Jerusalem-themed mental problems, were
referred to this clinic. Of these, 470 were admitted to hospital. On average,
100 such tourists have been seen annually, 40 of them requiring admission to
hospital. About 2 million tourists visit Jerusalem each year. Kalian and
Witztum note that as a proportion of the total numbers of tourists visiting the
city, this is not significantly different from any other city. The statements
of these claims has however been disputed, with the arguments that experiencers
of the Jerusalem syndrome already were mentally ill. Guilt about normal sexual
functions. Hitchens asserts that some religions view some types of natural
sexual activity (such as masturbation) as evil or immoral, and that this view
can sometimes lead to neuroses or other ill effects. Darrel Ray who has worked
as a clinical psychologist and occupational psychologist arranged a survey over
sex and religion. Ray claims his respondents generally indicate their sex lives
improved after they abandoned religion. Respondents whose previous religion was
Mormonism were most likely to report improved sex after deconversion. Baptist,
Jehovah's Witness, Pentecostal, Seventh Day Adventist were also likely to
report improved sex lives after abandoning their religion because those
religions like Mormonism promote guilt over sex. However, his study was not
peer reviewed and was allegedly not up to social science standards. Blood
sacrifice. Hitchens claims that many religions endorse blood sacrifice, wherein
innocent victims are killed or harmed to appease deities, specifically citing
Judaism for its obsession with blood and sacrifice, particularly the goal of
identifying and sacrificing of a pure red heifer (described in Numbers 19), the
pursuit of which Hitchens characterizes as "absurd", singling out the goal of
raising a human child in a "bubble" so as to "be privileged to cut that
heifer's throat". Genital modification and mutilation. Hitchens claims that
many religions endorse male circumcision and female genital cutting, which he
views as genital mutilation, and as immoral, unhealthy, and unnecessary.
Counterarguments to religion as harmful to individuals. Responding in the book
The Irrational Atheist to criticisms that religion is harmful, Theodore Beale
argues that religious individuals tend to be happier and healthier, more likely
to have children, and more sexually satisfied than non-religious individuals.
There is substantial research suggesting that religious people are happier and
less stressed. Surveys by Gallup, the National Opinion Research Center and the
Pew Organization conclude that spiritually committed people are twice as likely
to report being "very happy" than the least religiously committed people. An
analysis of over 200 social studies contends that "high religiousness predicts
a rather lower risk of depression and drug abuse and fewer suicide attempts,
and more reports of satisfaction with sex life and a sense of well-being," and
a review of 498 studies published in peer-reviewed journals concluded that a
large majority of them showed a positive correlation between religious
commitment and higher levels of perceived well-being and self-esteem and lower
levels of hypertension, depression, and clinical delinquency. Studies by Keith
Ward show that overall religion is a positive contributor to mental health, and
a meta-analysis of 34 recent studies published between 1990 and 2001 also found
that religiosity has a salutary relationship with psychological adjustment,
being related to less psychological distress, more life satisfaction, and
better self-actualization. Andrew E. Clark and Orsolya Lelkes surveyed 90,000
people in 26 European countries and found that "own religious behaviour is
positively correlated with individual life satisfaction.", greater overall
"religiosity" in a region also correlates positively with "individual life
satisfaction". The reverse was found to be true: a large "atheist" (non-
religious) population "has negative spillover effects" for both the religious
and non-religious members of the population. Finally, a recent systematic
review of 850 research papers on the topic concluded that "the majority of
well-conducted studies found that higher levels of religious involvement are
positively associated with indicators of psychological well-being (life
satisfaction, happiness, positive affect, and higher morale) and with less
depression, suicidal thoughts and behavior, drug/alcohol use/abuse." However,
as of 2001, most of those studies were conducted within the United States.
There is no significant correlation between religiosity and individual
happiness in Denmark and the Netherlands, countries that have lower rates of
religion than the United States. A cross-national investigation on subjective
well-being has noted that, globally, religious people are usually happier than
nonreligious people, though nonreligious people can also reach high levels of
happiness. Harm to society. Some aspects of religion are criticized on the
basis that they damage society as a whole. Steven Weinberg, for example,
believe it takes religion to make good people do evil. Bertrand Russell and
Richard Dawkins cite religiously inspired or justified violence, resistance to
social change, attacks on science, repression of women, and homophobia. Hartung
has claimed that major religious moral codes can lead to "us vs. them" group
and mentality (often referred to as moral superiority) which can dehumanise or
demonise individuals outside their faith as "not fully human", or less worthy.
Results can vary from mild discrimination to outright genocide. A poll by The
Guardian, a UK intellectual newspaper noted that 82% of the British people
believe that religion is socially divisive and that this effect is harmful
despite the observation that non-believers outnumber believers 2 to 1. Holy war
and religious terrorism. Hitchens and Dawkins say that religions do tremendous
harm to society in three ways: Although the causes of terrorism are complex, it
may be that terrorists are partially reassured by their religious views that
God is on their side and will reward them in heaven for punishing unbelievers.
""Tuez-les tous; Dieu reconnaitra les siens,"" or "Kill them all; God will
recognize his." Theoretical physicist Michio Kaku considers religious terrorism
as one of the main threats in humanity's evolution from a Type 0 to Type 1
civilization. Arguments against religion being a significant cause of violence.
H. Allen Orr also attributed many of the historical religious violent
activities to the secular and political roles that were performed by the church
in the past and noted that the recent absence of religion among the government
of modern communist nations did not lead to Mao Zedong, Pol Pot, or Joseph
Stalin leading any less violently. In response to some apologists who note that
the lack of religion did not prevent many modern dictators from committing
great acts of violence, Christopher Hitchens said: "it is interesting to find
that people of faith now seek defensively to say that they are no worse than
fascists or Nazis or Stalinists." Furthermore, Richard Dawkins, in response to
Pope Benedict's accusations that atheism was responsible for "some 20th-century
atrocities", has replied: "how dare Ratzinger suggest that atheism has any
connection whatsoever with their horrific deeds? Any more than Hitler and
Stalin's non-belief in leprechauns or unicorns... There is no logical pathway
from atheism to wickedness." Suppression of scientific progress. Early modern
atheism developed in the 17th century, and Winfried Schroeder, a scholar of
atheism, noted that science during this time did not strengthen the case for
atheism. In the 18th century, Denis Diderot argued that atheism was less
scientific than metaphysics. However, since the 19th century, both atheists and
theists have said that science supports their worldviews. John William Draper
and Andrew Dickson White, authors of the conflict thesis, have argued that when
a religion offers a complete set of answers to the problems of purpose,
morality, origins, or science, it often discourages exploration of those areas
by suppressing curiosity, denies its followers a broader perspective, and can
prevent social, moral and scientific progress. Examples cited in their writings
include the trial of Galileo and Giordano Bruno's execution. During the 19th
century the conflict thesis developed. According to this model, any interaction
between religion and science must inevitably lead to open hostility, with
religion usually taking the part of the aggressor against new scientific ideas.
The historical conflict thesis was a popular historiographical approach in the
history of science during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but its
original form is almost entirely discarded by scholars today. Despite that,
conflict theory remains a popular view among the general public, and has been
publicized by the success of books such as "The God Delusion". Historians of
science including John Hedley Brooke and Ronald Numbers consider the "religion
vs. science" concept an oversimplification, and prefer to take a more nuanced
view of the subject. These historians cite, for example, the Galileo affair and
the Scopes trial, and assert that these were not purely instances of conflict
between science and religion; personal and political factors also weighed
heavily in the development of each. In addition, some historians contend that
religious organizations figure prominently in the broader histories of many
sciences, with many of the scientific minds until the professionalization of
scientific enterprise (in the 19th century) being clergy and other religious
thinkers. Some historians contend that many scientific developments, such as
Kepler's laws and the 19th century reformulation of physics in terms of energy,
were explicitly driven by religious ideas. More recently, many debates have
arisen that follow a pattern of faith versus reason, in particular the rise of
fundamentalist and bible literalist opposition to science and liberal
democracy. Examples include the creation-evolution controversy, and
controversies over the use of birth control, the separation of church and
state, opposition to research into embryonic stem cells, or theological
objections to vaccination, anesthesia, and blood transfusion. However, research
on perceptions of science among the American public concludes that most
religious groups see no general epistemological conflict with science or with
the seeking out of scientific knowledge, although there may be epistemic or
moral conflicts when scientists make counterclaims to religious tenets. Even
strict creationists tend to have very favorable views on science. Also, cross-
national studies, polled from 1981-2001, on views of science and religion have
noted that countries with higher religiosity have stronger trust in science,
whereas countries that are seen as more secular are more skeptical about the
impact of science and technology. Though the United States is a highly
religious country compared to other advanced industrial countries, according to
the National Science Foundation, public attitudes towards science are more
favorable in the United States than Europe, Russia, and Japan. A study on a
national sample of US college students examined whether they viewed the science
/ religion relationship as reflecting primarily conflict, collaboration, or
independence. The study concluded that the majority of undergraduates in both
the natural and social sciences do not see conflict between science and
religion. Another finding in the study was that it is more likely for students
to move away from a conflict perspective to an independence or collaboration
perspective than vice versa. Suppression of art and literature. In 1989, Muslim
religious leader Ayatollah Khomeini issued a religious edict condemning author
Salman Rushdie to death for the publication of "The Satanic Verses". Muslims in
Bangladesh issued a fatwa (religious decree) calling for the death of poet and
author Taslima Nasrin because of the women's rights issues raised in her books,
particularly her novel "Lajja". Morality. Albert Einstein stated that no
religious basis is needed in order to display ethical behavior. Nobel Peace
laureate, Muslim, and human rights activist Shirin Ebadi has criticized
dogmatic Islam as morally deficient, arguing that it elevates to moral status
many ancient and ill-informed rules that may have been designed for reasons of
hygiene, politics, or other reasons in a bygone era. An example of this would
be the idea that women and men must be kept separate, or that women who do not
cover themselves up modestly have tendencies for immorality, or are in some way
responsible for sexual assault. Dawkins contends that theistic religions
devalue human compassion and morality. In his view, the Bible contains many
injunctions against following one's conscience over scripture, and positive
actions are supposed to originate not from compassion, but from the fear of
punishment. Treatment of homosexuals. Many major religions, most prominently
traditional Christianity, Islam, Hinduism and Orthodox Judaism, consider
homosexuality immoral. Singer Elton John said organized religion promotes the
hatred of homosexuals: "I think religion has always tried to turn hatred
towards gay people... Organized religion does not seem to work. It turns people
into really hateful lemmings and it's not really compassionate."" In the United
States, conservative Christian groups such as the Christian Legal Society and
the Alliance Defense Fund have filed numerous lawsuits against public
universities, aimed at overturning policies that protect homosexuals from
discrimination and hate speech. These groups argue that such policies infringe
their right to freely exercise religion as guaranteed by the Free Exercise
Clause of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. Homosexuality
is illegal in most Muslim countries, and in many of these countries carries the
death penalty. In July 2005, two Iranian men, aged sixteen and eighteen, were
publicly hanged for homosexuality, causing an international outcry. Human
rights organisations estimate that hundreds of people have been executed for
homosexuality by Iranian authorities since the 1979 revolution. However, many
liberal religious groups, and particularly most New Age religions, are
accepting of homosexuals and do not regard their behavior as sinful, in
particular: the Anglican Church of Canada, the Episcopal Church, Progressive
Judaism, Moravian Church, Neopaganism, RaÃ«lism, the United Church of Canada,
the United Church of Christ, Unitarian Universalism, Haitian Voodoo, Wicca, and
the Metropolitan Community Church, which was established almost specifically
for this purpose. Racism. Religion has been used by some as justification for
advocating racism. The Ku Klux Klan, Christian Identity movement, Mormon
leaders, and some Post-Medieval Theologians have made claims that white people
are closer to God than other races. Religious terrorist organizations such as
the forenamed Ku Klux Klan, Kach and Kahane Chai and others also hold
ostensibly racist views. There are arguments, however, that these positions may
be as much reflections of contemporary social views as of what has been called
scientific racism. The LDS Church excluded blacks from the priesthood in the
church, from 1860 to 1978. Most Fundamentalist Mormon sects within the Latter
Day Saint movement, rejected the LDS Churchâ€™s 1978 decision to allow African
Americans to hold the priesthood, and continue to deny activity in the church
due to race. Due to these beliefs, in its Spring 2005 "Intelligence Report",
the Southern Poverty Law Center named the FLDS Church to its "hate group"
listing because of the church's teachings on race, which include a fierce
condemnation of interracial relationships. On the other hand, many Christians
have made efforts toward establishing racial equality, contributing to the
Civil Rights Movement. "The African American Review" sees as important the role
Christian revivalism in the black church played in the Civil Rights Movement.
Martin Luther King, Jr., an ordained Baptist minister, was a leader of the
American Civil Rights Movement and president of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference, a Christian Civil Rights organization. Treatment of
women. There have been reports that Islam authorizes the punishment of female
rape victims, such as the Saudi Arabian case where a rape victim was sentenced
to receive 90 lashes because she was in a car with a man that was not her
relative. Hitchens and the United Nations also say that Islam is used to
justify unnecessary and harmful female genital modification and mutilation,
when the purposes range from deprivation of sexual satisfaction to discourage
adultery, insuring virginity to their husbands, or generating appearance of
virginity. Witch hunts. Witch trials by the Christian churches from 1480
through 1800 often resulted in torture or death of the alleged witch. Some were
influenced by the Old Testament in the Exodus 22:18, which prescribes "thou
shalt not suffer a witch to live". These trials were unfair, witchcraft was
often not in evidence, and the trials were generally used to punish assertive
or independent women, such as midwives, or activists. Cruelty to animals.
Kosher slaughter has historically attracted criticism from non-Jews as
allegedly being inhumane and unsanitary, in part as an antisemitic canard that
eating ritually slaughtered meat caused degeneration, and in part out of
economic motivation to remove Jews from the meat industry. Sometimes, however,
these criticisms were directed at Judaism as a religion. In 1893, animal
advocates campaigning against kosher slaughter in Aberdeen attempted to link
cruelty with Jewish religious practice. In the 1920s, Polish critics of kosher
slaughter claimed that the practice actually had no basis in Scripture. In
contrast, Jewish authorities argue that the slaughter methods are based
directly upon Genesis IX:3, and that "these laws are binding on Jews today."
More recently, kosher slaughter has attracted criticism from some groups
concerned with animal welfare, who contend that the absence of any form of
anesthesia or stunning prior to the severance of the animal's jugular vein
causes unnecessary pain and suffering. Supporters of kosher slaughter counter
that Judaism requires the practice precisely because it is considered humane.
Research conducted by Temple Grandin and Joe M. Regenstein in 1994 concluded
that, practiced correctly with proper restraint systems, kosher slaughter
results in little pain and suffering, and notes that behavioral reactions to
the incision made during kosher slaughter are less than those to noises such as
clanging or hissing, inversion or pressure during restraint. Other forms of
ritual slaughter, such as Islamic ritual slaughter, have also come under
controversy. Logan Scherer, writing for PETA, said that animals sacrificed
according to Islamic law can not be stunned before they are killed. Muslims are
only allowed to eat meat that has been killed according to Sharia law, and they
say that Islamic law on ritual slaughter is designed to reduce the pain and
distress that the animal suffers. Recent calls for the abolition of kosher
(Jewish) and halal (Muslim) slaughter were made by Germany's federal chamber of
veterinarians and the Party for Animals in the Dutch parliament. The lower
house of the Dutch parliament passed the bill but left a loophole saying that
religious groups could continue ritual slaughter if they proved it was no more
painful than other methods of slaughter. However, in June 2012, the upper
house, the Senate, prevented the bill from becoming law. Arguments against
religion promoting immoral behavior. Some scientific studies show that the
degree of religiosity is generally found to be associated with higher ethical
attitudes â€” for example, surveys suggesting a positive connection between
faith and altruism. Although a recent study by Gregory S. Paul published in the
"Journal of Religion and Society" argues for a positive correlation between the
degree of "public religiosity" in a society and certain measures of
dysfunction. Further analysis published later in the same journal contends that
a number of methodological problems undermine any findings or conclusions to be
taken from the research. Survey research suggests that believers do tend to
hold different views than non-believers on a variety of social, ethical and
moral questions. According to a 2003 survey conducted in the United States by
The Barna Group, a Christian-affiliated research organization, those who
described themselves as believers were less likely than those describing
themselves as atheists or agnostics to consider the following behaviors morally
acceptable: cohabitating with someone of the opposite sex outside of marriage,
enjoying sexual fantasies, having an abortion, sexual relationships outside of
marriage, gambling, looking at pictures of nudity or explicit sexual behavior,
getting drunk, and "having a sexual relationship with someone of the same sex."
Moreover, a comprehensive study by Harvard University professor Robert Putnam
found that religious people are more charitable than their irreligious
counterparts. The study revealed that forty percent of worship service
attending Americans volunteer regularly to help the poor and elderly as opposed
to 15% of Americans who never attend services. Moreover, religious individuals
are more likely than non-religious individuals to volunteer for school and
youth programs (36% vs. 15%), a neighborhood or civic group (26% vs. 13%), and
for health care (21% vs. 13%). Other research has shown similar correlations
between religiosity and giving. Counterarguments to religion as harmful to
society. A common response to such criticisms is that those guilty of such
actions are merely misguided extremists and don't represent mainstream
religion, or that such things are only exceptions and that, by and large,
religion is a positive civilizing influence on society. Hector Avalos counters
that this may be a No true Scotsman fallacy in that decisions on which
believers are considered "mainstream" and which ones are "extremist" are based
on biases to support any given position. One study notes that significant
levels of social dysfunction are found in highly religious countries such as
the US and that countries which have lower religiosity also tend to have lower
levels of dysfunction. In response,an analysis published later in the same
journal contends that a number of methodological problems undermine any
findings or conclusions to be taken from the research. In the same issue, Gary
Jensen builds on and refines Paul's study. His conclusion, after carrying out
elaborate multivariate statistical studies, is that a complex relationship
exists between religiosity and homicide with some dimensions of religiosity
encouraging homicide and other dimensions discouraging it." Other studies show
positive links in the relationship between religiosity and moral behavior â€”
for example, surveys suggesting a positive connection between faith and
altruism. Other research in criminology indicates an "inverse" relationship
between religion and crime, with many studies establishing some degree of
beneficial connections. Indeed, a meta-analysis of 60 studies on religion and
crime concluded, "religious behaviors and beliefs exert a moderate deterrent
effect on individuals' criminal behavior". Theodore Beale responds to
criticisms that religion harms society by arguing that religious individuals
tend to be more generous and more likely to have children. Religious belief
appears to be the strongest predictor of charitable giving. One study found
that average charitable giving in 2000 by religious individuals ($2,210) was
over three times that of secular individuals ($642). Giving to non-religious
charities by religious individuals was $88 higher. Religious individuals are
also more likely to volunteer time, donate blood, and give back money when
accidentally given too much change. A 2007 study by The Barna Group found that
"active-faith" individuals (those who had attended a church service in the past
week) reported that they had given on average $1,500 in 2006, while "no-faith"
individuals reported that they had given on average $200. "Active-faith" adults
claimed to give twice as much to non-church-related charities as "no-faith"
individuals claimed to give. They were also more likely to report that they
were registered to vote, that they volunteered, that they personally helped
someone who was homeless, and to describe themselves as "active in the
community." Corrupt purposes of leaders. Many criticisms focus on the purposes
of the leaders of the religions, rather than on the religious doctrines.
Corrupt or immoral leaders. Hitchens has noted some leaders who have abused
their positions for financial gains such as the Indian mystic Bhagwan Shree
Rajneesh who owned 90 Rolls Royce cars, cult leader David Koresh, Joseph Smith
who had about 27 wives, and Brigham Young who had about 57 wives. Authoritarian
political power. The term "authoritarian" is used to describe an organization,
an institution, or a state that enforces strong and sometimes oppressive
measures against those within its sphere of influence, generally without any
attempt at gaining their consent and often not allowing criticism of its
policies. In this sense, some religious organizations can be seen as
authoritarian, insofar as their goal is to define themselves as the ultimate
authority by which the law of the land is granted. As this divine source of
authority is not to be criticized by non-religious arguments, it is the
antithesis to secularism. A country where the above has been achieved is called
a theocracy. Some religions also teach that there was, or is, a human with
divinity or touched by divine guidance, and who is therefore infallible: for
example Jesus, Muhammad and, in certain circumstances, the Pope. Divine mandate
used for political gain. The ancient Egyptians believed that upon taking the
throne, the pharaoh became the earthly embodiment of a god. They believed that
in his role as both man and god, he was responsible for preserving not only the
empire, but the universe itself. Until the end of World War II the Emperor of
Japan held a similar status, and deification of Roman emperors was common
practice following the reign of Augustus. Systems such as this equated
political opposition to heresy, and served to support existing power structures
by suppressing dissent. On New Year's Day 1946, Emperor Hirohito (formally)
declined claims of divinity with the Humanity Declaration. Dominionism. The
term dominionism is often used to describe a political movement among
fundamentalist Christians. Critics view dominionism as an attempt to improperly
impose Christianity as the national faith of the United States. It emerged in
the late 1980s inspired by the book, film and lecture series, "Whatever
Happened to the Human Race?" by Francis A. Schaeffer and C. Everett Koop.
Schaeffer's views influenced conservatives like Jerry Falwell, Tim LaHaye, John
W. Whitehead, and although they represent different theological and political
ideas, dominionists believe they have a Christian duty to take "control of a
sinful secular society", either by putting fundamentalist Christians in office,
or by introducing biblical law into the secular sphere. Social scientists have
used the word "dominionism" to refer to adherence to Dominion Theology as well
as to the influence in the broader Christian Right of ideas inspired by
Dominion Theology. In the early 1990s, sociologist Sara Diamond and journalist
Frederick Clarkson defined "dominionism" as a movement that, while including
Dominion Theology and Christian Reconstructionism as subsets, is much broader
in scope, extending to much of the Christian Right. Beginning in 2004 with
essayist Katherine Yurica, a group of authors including journalist Chris Hedges
Marion Maddox, James Rudin, Sam Harris, and the group TheocracyWatch began
applying the term to a broader spectrum of people than have sociologists such
as Diamond. Full adherents to reconstructionism are few and marginalized among
conservative Christians. The terms "dominionist" and "dominionism" are rarely
used for self-description, and their usage has been attacked from several
quarters. Chip Berlet wrote that "some critics of the Christian Right have
stretched the term dominionism past its breaking point." Sara Diamond wrote
that "writing about the Christian Right's take-over plans has generally taken
the form of conspiracy theory." Journalist Anthony Williams charged that its
purpose is "to smear the Republican Party as the party of domestic Theocracy,
facts be damned." Stanley Kurtz labeled it "conspiratorial nonsense,"
"political paranoia," and "guilt by association," and decried Hedges' "vague
characterizations" that allow him to "paint a highly questionable picture of a
virtually faceless and nameless 'Dominionist' Christian mass." Kurtz also
complained about a perceived link between average Christian evangelicals and
extremism such as Christian Reconstructionism. See also. Criticism of specific
