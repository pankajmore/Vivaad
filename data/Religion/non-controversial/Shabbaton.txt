Shabbaton The Hebrew term shabbaton () may be translated into English to mean
sabbatical. The concept of a sabbatical year (shmita) has a source in several
places in the Bible (e.g. Leviticus 25), where there is a commandment to desist
from working the fields in the seventh year. In contemporary Israel, when one
takes a "shabbaton", one takes the year off in search of other pursuits. It is
an extended rest from work, a hiatus, typically 2 months plus. This period is
called (a) sabbatical. Colloquially, the term "shabbaton" means an event or
program of education, and usually celebration, that is held on a Shabbat
(Jewish sabbath). Sometimes a shabbaton is an entire weekend with the main
focus on the Shabbat. Many communities have such events, including youth
groups, singles groups, synagogues, schools, social groups, charitable groups
or even family reunions. These events can be multi-generational and wide open,
or limited to a small specific group. A "shabbaton" can be held where a group
usually meets, or at an off-site location. By calling such a program a
"shabbaton", rather than just a "retreat", one signifies recognition of the
importance of Shabbat in the event/program.
