Dead Sea Scrolls The Dead Sea Scrolls are a collection of 972 texts discovered
between 1946 and 1956, that consist of biblical manuscripts from what is now
known as the Hebrew Bible and extra-biblical documents found on the northwest
shore of the Dead Sea, from which they derive their name. They were
specifically located at "Khirbet Qumran" in what was then British Mandate
Palestine, and since 1947, what has been known as the West Bank. The texts are
of great historical and religious significance and include the earliest known
surviving copies of biblical and extra-biblical documents, as well as
preserving evidence of great diversity in late Second Temple Judaism. They are
written in Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek, and Nabataean, mostly on parchment, but with
some written on papyrus and bronze. These manuscripts have been dated to
various ranges between 408Â BCE and 318Â CE. Bronze coins found on the site
form a series beginning with Hyrcanus 1 (135-104Â BCE) and continue without a
gap until the first Jewish revolt (66â€“73 CE). The scrolls are traditionally
identified with the ancient Jewish sect called the Essenes, though some recent
interpretations have challenged this association and argue that the scrolls
were penned by priests in Jerusalem, Zadokites, or other unknown Jewish groups.
The Dead Sea Scrolls are traditionally divided into three groups: "Biblical"
manuscripts (copies of texts from the Hebrew Bible), which comprise roughly 40%
of the identified scrolls; Other manuscripts (known documents from the Second
Temple Period like Enoch, Jubilees, Tobit, Sirach, additional psalms, etc.,
that were not ultimately canonized in the Hebrew Bible), which comprise roughly
30% of the identified scrolls; and "Sectarian" manuscripts (previously unknown
documents that shed light on the rules and beliefs of a particular group or
groups within greater Judaism) like the Community Rule, War Scroll, Pesher on
Habakkuk (Hebrew: ×¤×©×¨ "pesher" = "Commentary"), and the Rule of the
Blessing, which comprise roughly 30% of the identified scrolls. Discovery. The
Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered in a series of twelve caves around the site
known as Wadi Qumran near the Dead Sea in what is now the West Bank between
1946 and 1956 by the Bedouin people and archeologists. Initial discovery
(1946â€“1947). The initial discovery, by Bedouin shepherd Muhammed Edh-Dhib,
his cousin Jum'a Muhammed and Khalil Musa, took place between November 1946 and
February 1947. The shepherds discovered 7 scrolls (See Fragment and scroll
lists) housed in jars in a cave at what is now known as the Qumran site. John
C. Trever reconstructed the story of the scrolls from several interviews with
the Bedouin. edh-Dhib's cousin noticed the caves, but edh-Dhib himself was the
first to actually fall into one. He retrieved a handful of scrolls, which
Trever identifies as the Isaiah Scroll, Habakkuk Commentary, and the Community
Rule, and took them back to the camp to show to his family. None of the scrolls
were destroyed in this process, despite popular rumor. The Bedouin kept the
scrolls hanging on a tent pole while they figured out what to do with them,
periodically taking them out to show people. At some point during this time,
the Community Rule was split in two. The Bedouin first took the scrolls to a
dealer named Ibrahim 'Ijha in Bethlehem. 'Ijha returned them, saying they were
worthless, after being warned that they might have been stolen from a
synagogue. Undaunted, the Bedouin went to a nearby market, where a Syrian
Christian offered to buy them. A sheikh joined their conversation and suggested
they take the scrolls to Khalil Eskander Shahin, "Kando," a cobbler and part-
time antiques dealer. The Bedouin and the dealers returned to the site, leaving
one scroll with Kando and selling three others to a dealer for GBP7 (US$29 in
2003). The original scrolls continued to change hands after the Bedouin left
them in the possession of a third party until a sale could be arranged. (See
Ownership) In 1947 the original seven scrolls caught the attention of Dr. John
C. Trever, of the American Schools of Oriental Research (ASOR), who compared
the script in the scrolls to that of "The Nash Papyrus", the oldest biblical
manuscript then known, and found similarities between them. In March, the 1948
Arab-Israeli War prompted the move of some of scrolls to Beirut, Lebanon, for
safekeeping. On 11 April 1948, Miller Burrows, head of the ASOR, announced the
discovery of the scrolls in a general press release. Search for the Qumran
caves (1948â€“1949). Early in September 1948, Mar brought Professor Ovid R.
Sellers, the new Director of ASOR, some additional scroll fragments that he had
acquired. By the end of 1948, nearly two years after their discovery, scholars
had yet to locate the original cave where the fragments had been found. With
unrest in the country at that time, no large-scale search could be undertaken
safely. Sellers attempted to get the Syrians to assist in the search for the
cave, but he was unable to pay their price. In early 1948, the government of
Jordan gave permission to the Arab Legion to search the area where the original
Qumran cave was thought to be. Consequently, Cave 1 was rediscovered on 28
January 1949, by Belgian United Nations observer Captain Phillipe Lippens and
Arab Legion Captain Akkash el-Zebn. Qumran caves rediscovery and new scroll
discoveries (1949â€“1951). The rediscovery of Cave 1 prompted the initial
excavation of the site from 15 February to 5 March 1949 by the Jordanian
Department of Antiquities. The excavation was led by Lancaster Harding,
director of the Palestine Archaeological Museum, and Roland de Vaux, the
President of the Trustees of the museum. The Cave 1 site yielded discoveries of
additional Dead Sea Scroll fragments, linen cloth, jars, and other artifacts.
Excavations of Qumran (1951â€“1956). In November 1951, Roland de Vaux and his
team from the ASOR began a full excavation of Qumran. In February 1952, the
Bedouin people discovered 30 fragments in what was to be designated Cave 2.
These included fragments of Jubilees and Ben Sira written in Hebrew. The
following month, the ASOR team discovered Cave 3 and the Copper Scroll. Between
September and December 1952 the fragments and scrolls of Caves 4, 5, and 6 were
subsequently discovered by the ASOR teams. With the monetary value of the
scrolls rising as their historical significance was made more public, the
Bedouins and the ASOR archaeologists accelerated their search for the scrolls
separately in the same general area of Qumran, which was over 1 kilometer in
length. Between 1953 and 1956, Roland de Vaux led four more archaeological
expeditions in the area to uncover scrolls and artifacts. The last cave, Cave
11, was discovered in 1956 and yielded the last fragments to be found in the
vicinity of Qumran. Fragment and scroll lists. Qumran Cave 1. Cave 1 was
discovered in the winter or spring of 1947. It was first excavated by Gerald
Lankester Harding and Roland de Vaux from 15 February to 5 March 1949. In
addition to the original seven scrolls, Cave 1 produced jars and bowls, whose
chemical composition and shape matched vessels discovered at the settlement at
Qumran, pieces of cloth, and additional fragments that matched portions of the
original scrolls, thereby confirming that the original scrolls came from Cave
1. Qumran Cave 2. Cave 2 was discovered in February 1952. It yielded 300
fragments from 33 manuscripts, including Jubilees and the Wisdom of Sirach in
the original Hebrew. Qumran Cave 3. Cave 3 was discovered on 14 March 1952. The
cave yielded 14 manuscripts including Jubilees and the curious Copper Scroll,
which lists 67 hiding places, mostly underground, throughout the ancient Roman
province of Judea (now Israel). According to the scroll, the secret caches held
astonishing amounts of gold, silver, copper, aromatics, and manuscripts. Qumran
Caves 4a and 4b. Cave 4 was discovered in August 1952, and was excavated from
22â€“29 September 1952 by Gerald Lankester Harding, Roland de Vaux, and JÃ³zef
Milik. Cave 4 is actually two hand-cut caves (4a and 4b), but since the
fragments were mixed, they are labeled as 4Q. Cave 4 is the most famous of
Qumran caves both because of its visibility from the Qumran plateau and its
productivity. It is visible from the plateau to the south of the Qumran
settlement. It is by far the most productive of all Qumran caves, producing
ninety percent of the Dead Sea Scrolls and scroll fragments (approx. 15,000
fragments from 500 different texts), including 9â€“10 copies of Jubilees, along
with 21 "tefillin" and 7 "mezuzot". Qumran Cave 5. Cave 5 was discovered
alongside Cave 6 in 1952, shortly after the discovery of Cave 4. Cave 5
produced approximately 25 manuscripts. Qumran Cave 6. Cave 6 was discovered
alongside Cave 5 in 1952, shortly after the discovery of Cave 4. Cave 6
contained fragments of about 31 manuscripts. Qumran Cave 7. Cave 7, along with
caves 8 and 9, was one of the only caves that is accessible by passing through
the settlement at Qumran. Carved into the southern end of the Qumran plateau,
archaeologists excavated cave 7 in 1957. Cave 7 yielded fewer than 20 fragments
of Greek documents, including 7Q2 (the "Letter of Jeremiah" = Baruch 6), 7Q5
(which became the subject of much speculation in later decades), and a Greek
copy of a scroll of Enoch. Cave 7 also produced several inscribed potsherds and
jars. Qumran Cave 8. Cave 8, along with caves 7 and 9, was one of the only
caves that is accessible by passing through the settlement at Qumran. Carved
into the southern end of the Qumran plateau, archaeologists excavated cave 8 in
1957. Cave 8 produced five fragments: Genesis (8QGen), Psalms (8QPs), a
tefillin fragment (8QPhyl), a mezuzah (8QMez), and a hymn (8QHymn). Cave 8 also
produced several tefillin cases, a box of leather objects, tons of lamps, jars,
and the sole of a leather shoe. Qumran Cave 9. Cave 9, along with caves 7 and
8, was one of the only caves that is accessible by passing through the
settlement at Qumran. Carved into the southern end of the Qumran plateau,
archaeologists excavated cave 9 in 1957. Qumran Cave 11. Cave 11 was discovered
in 1956 and yielded 21 texts, some of which were quite lengthy. The Temple
Scroll, so called because more than half of it pertains to the construction of
the Temple of Jerusalem, was found in Cave 11, and is by far the longest
scroll. It is now 26.7Â feet (8.15Â m) long. Its original length may have been
over 28Â feet (8.75Â m). The Temple Scroll was regarded by Yigael Yadin as "The
Torah According to the Essenes." On the other hand, Hartmut Stegemann, a
contemporary and friend of Yadin, believed the scroll was not to be regarded as
such, but was a document without exceptional significance. Stegemann notes that
it is not mentioned or cited in any known Essene writing. Also in Cave 11, an
escatological fragment about the biblical figure Melchizedek (11Q13) was found.
Cave 11 also produced a copy of Jubilees. According to former chief editor of
the DSS editorial team John Strugnell, there are at least four privately owned
scrolls from Cave 11, that have not yet been made available for scholars. Among
them is a complete Aramaic manuscript of the Book of Enoch. Fragments with
unknown provenance. Some fragments of scrolls do not have significant
archaeological and provenance records that reveal which designated Qumran cave
area they were found in. They are believed to have come from Wadi Qumran caves,
however are just as likely to have come from other archaeological sites in the
Judaean Desert area. These fragments have therefore been designated to the
temporary "X" series. Origin of the Scrolls. Christian Origin Theory. Spanish
Jesuit Josep O'Callaghanâ€“MartÃ­nez has argued that one fragment (7Q5)
preserves a portion of text from the New Testament Gospel of Mark 6:52â€“53. In
recent years, Robert Eisenman has advanced the theory that some scrolls
describe the early Christian community. Eisenman also attempted to relate the
career of James the Just and the Apostle Paul / Paul of Tarsus to some of these
documents. Jerusalem Origin Theory. Some scholars have argued that the scrolls
were the product of Jews living in Jerusalem, who hid the scrolls in the caves
near Qumran while fleeing from the Romans during the destruction of Jerusalem
in 70Â CE. Karl Heinrich Rengstorf first proposed that the Dead Sea Scrolls
originated at the library of the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem. Later, Norman Golb
suggested that the scrolls were the product of multiple libraries in Jerusalem,
and not necessarily the Jerusalem Temple library. Proponents of the Jerusalem
Origin theory point to the diversity of thought and handwriting among the
scrolls as evidence against a Qumran origin of the scrolls. Several
archaeologists have also accepted an origin of the scrolls other than Qumran,
including Yizhar Hirschfeld and most recently Yizhak Magen and Yuval Peleg, who
all understand the remains of Qumran to be those of a Hasmonean fort that was
reused during later periods. Qumranâ€“Essene Theory. The prevalent view among
scholars, almost universally held until the 1990s, is the "Qumranâ€“Essene"
hypothesis originally posited by Roland GuÃ©rin de Vaux and JÃ³zef Tadeusz
Milik, though independently both Eliezer Sukenik and Butrus Sowmy of St Mark's
Monastery connected scrolls with the Essenes well before any excavations at
Qumran. The Qumranâ€“Essene theory holds that the scrolls were written by the
Essenes, or perhaps by another Jewish sectarian group, residing at Khirbet
Qumran. They composed the scrolls and ultimately hid them in the nearby caves
during the Jewish Revolt sometime between 66 and 68Â CE. The site of Qumran was
destroyed and the scrolls were never recovered by those that placed them there.
A number of arguments are used to support this theory. The Qumranâ€“Essene
theory has been the dominant theory since its initial proposal by Roland de
Vaux and J.T. Milik. Recently, however, several other scholars have proposed
alternative origins of the scrolls. Qumranâ€“Sectarian Theory.
Qumranâ€“Sectarian theories are variations on the Qumranâ€“Essene theory. The
main point of departure from the Qumranâ€“Essene theory is hesitation to link
the Dead Sea Scrolls specifically with the Essenes. Most proponents of the
Qumranâ€“Sectarian theory understand a group of Jews living in or near Qumran
to be responsible for the Dead Sea Scrolls, but do not necessarily conclude
that the sectarians are Essenes. Qumranâ€“Sadducean Theory. A specific
variation on the Qumranâ€“Sectarian theory that has gained much recent
popularity is the work of Lawrence H. Schiffman, who proposes that the
community was led by a group of Zadokite priests (Sadducees). The most
important document in support of this view is the "Miqsat Ma'ase Ha-Torah"
(4QMMT), which cites purity laws (such as the transfer of impurities) identical
to those attributed in rabbinic writings to the Sadducees. 4QMMT also
reproduces a festival calendar that follows Sadducee principles for the dating
of certain festival days. Physical characteristics. Age. Radiocarbon dating.
Parchment from a number of the Dead Sea Scrolls have been carbon dated. The
initial test performed in 1950 was on a piece of linen from one of the caves.
This test gave an indicative dating of 33Â CE plus or minus 200 years,
eliminating early hypotheses relating the scrolls to the mediaeval period.
Since then two large series of tests have been performed on the scrolls
themselves. The results were summarized by VanderKam and Flint, who said the
tests give "strong reason for thinking that most of the Qumran manuscripts
belong to the last two centuries BCE and the first century CE." Paleographic
dating. Analysis of handwriting, a path of study known as palaeography, was
applied to the text on the Dead Sea Scrolls by a variety of scholars in the
field. Major linguistic analysis by Cross and Avigad dates fragments from
225Â BCE to 50Â CE. These dates were determined by examining the size,
variability, and style of the text. The same fragments were later analyzed
using radiocarbon date testing and were dated to an estimated range of 385Â BCE
to 82Â CE with a 68% accuracy rate. Ink and parchment. The scrolls were
analyzed using a cyclotron at the University of California, Davis, where it was
found that two types of black ink were used: iron-gall ink and carbon soot ink.
In addition, a third ink on the scrolls that was red in color was found to be
made with cinnabar (HgS, mercury sulfide). There are only four uses of this red
ink in the entire collection of Dead Sea Scroll fragments. The black inks found
on the scrolls that are made up of carbon soot were found to be from olive oil
lamps. Gall nuts from oak trees, present in some, but not all of the black inks
on the scrolls, was added to make the ink more resilient to smudging common
with pure carbon inks. Honey, oil, vinegar and water were often added to the
mixture to thin the ink to a proper consistency for writing. In order to apply
the ink to the scrolls, its writers used reed pens. The Dead Sea scrolls were
written on parchment made of processed animal hide known as vellum
(approximately 85.5 - 90.5% of the scrolls), papyrus (estimated at 8.0 - 13.0%
of the scrolls), and sheets of bronze composed of about 99.0% copper and 1.0%
tin (approximately 1.5% of the scrolls). For those scrolls written on animal
hides, scholars with the Israeli Antiquities Authority, by use of DNA testing
for assembly purposes, believe that there may be a hierarchy in the religious
importance of the texts based on which type of animal was used to create the
hide. Scrolls written on goat and calf hides are considered by scholars to be
more significant in nature, while those written on gazelle or ibex are
considered to be less religiously significant in nature. In addition, tests by
the National Institute of Nuclear Physics in Sicily, Italy, have suggested that
the origin of parchment of select Dead Sea Scroll fragments is from the Qumran
area itself, by using X-ray and Particle Induced X-ray emission testing of the
water used to make the parchment that were compared with the water from the
area around the Qumran site. Deterioration, storage, and preservation. The Dead
Sea Scrolls that were found were originally preserved by the dry, arid, and low
humidity conditions present within the Qumran area adjoining the Dead Sea. In
addition, the lack of the use of tanning materials on the parchment of the Dead
Sea Scrolls and the very low airflow in the Qumran caves also contributed
significantly to their preservation. Some of the scrolls were found stored in
clay jars within the Qumran caves, further helping to preserve them from
deterioration. The original handling of the scrolls by archaeologists and
scholars was done inappropriately, and, along with their storage in an
uncontrolled environment, they began a process of more rapid deterioration than
they had experienced at Qumran. During the first few years in the late 1940s
and early 1950s, adhesive tape used to join fragments and seal cracks caused
significant damage to the documents. The Government of Jordan had recognized
the urgency of protecting the scrolls from deterioration and the presence of
the deterioration among the scrolls. However, the government did not have
adequate funds to purchase all the scrolls for their protection and agreed to
have foreign institutions purchase the scrolls and have them held at their
museum in Jerusalem until they could be "adequately studied". In early 1953,
they were moved to the Palestine Archaeological Museum in East Jerusalem and
through their transportation suffered more deterioration and damage. The museum
was underfunded and had limited resources with which to examine the scrolls,
and, as a result, conditions of the "scrollery" and storage area were left
relatively uncontrolled by modern standards. The museum had left most of the
fragments and scrolls lying between window glass, trapping the moisture in with
them, causing an acceleration in the deterioration process. During a portion of
the conflict during the 1956 Arab-Israeli War, the scrolls collection of the
Palestinian Archaeological Museum was stored in the vault of the Ottoman Bank
in Amman, Jordan. Damp conditions from temporary storage of the scrolls in the
Ottoman Bank vault from 1956 to the Spring of 1957 lead to a more rapid rate of
deterioration of the scrolls. The conditions caused mildew to develop on the
scrolls and fragments, and some of the fragments were partially destroyed or
made illegible by the glue and paper of the manila envelopes in which they were
stored while in the vault. By 1958 it was noted that up to 5% of some of the
scrolls had completely deteriorated. Many of the texts had become illegible and
many of the parchments had darkened considerably. Until the 1970s, the scrolls
continued to deteriorate because of poor storage arrangements, exposure to
different adhesives, and being trapped in moist environments. Fragments written
on parchment (rather than papyrus or bronze) in the hands of private collectors
and scholars suffered an even worse fate than those in the hands of the museum,
with large portions of fragments being reported to have disappeared by 1966. In
the late 1960s, the deterioration was becoming a major concern with scholars
and museum officials alike. Scholars John Allegro and Sir Francis Frank were
some of the first to strongly advocate for better preservation techniques.
Early attempts made by both the British and Israel Museums to remove the
adhesive tape ended up exposing the parchment to an array of chemicals,
including "British Leather Dressing," and darkening some of them significantly.
In the 1970s and 1980s, other preservation attempts were made that included
removing the glass plates and replacing them with cardboard and removing
pressure against the plates that held the scrolls in storage; however, the
fragments and scrolls continued to rapidly deteriorate during this time. In
1991, the Israeli Antiquities Authority established a temperature controlled
laboratory for the storage and preservation of the scrolls. The actions and
preservation methods of Rockefeller Museum staff were concentrated on the
removal of tape, oils, metals, salt, and other contaminants. The fragments and
scrolls are preserved using acid-free cardboard and stored in solander boxes in
the climate-controlled storage area. Photography and assembly. Since the Dead
Sea Scrolls were initially held by different parties during and after the
excavation process, they were not all photographed by the same organization nor
in their entirety. First photographs by the American Schools of Oriental
Research (1948). The first individual to photograph a portion of the collection
was John C. Trever (1916â€“2006), a biblical scholar and archaeologist, who was
a resident for the American Schools of Oriental Research. He photographed three
of the scrolls discovered in Cave 1 on 21 February 1948 soon after their
discovery in February, both on black-and-white and standard color film.
Although an amateur photographer, the quality of his photographs often exceeded
the visibility of the scrolls themselves as, over the years, the ink of the
texts quickly deteriorated after they were removed from their linen wrappings.
Infrared photography and plate assembly by the Palestinian Archaeological
Museum (1952-1967). A majority of the collection from the Qumran caves was
acquired by the Palestine Archeological Museum. They hired Najib Albina, a
local Arab photographer trained by Lewis Larsson of the American Colony in
Jerusalem to take photographs of the scrolls. Between 1952 and 1967, Albina
documented the five stage process of the sorting and assembly of the scrolls,
done by the curator and staff of the Palestine Archeological Museum, using
infrared photography. Using a process known today as broadband, fluorescence
infrared photography, or NIR photography, Najib and the team at the museum
assembled over 1750 photographic plates of the scrolls and fragments. The
photographs were taken on animal skin using large format film, allowing for the
text to standout, making the plates especially useful for assembling fragments.
Being the earliest photographs of the museum's collection, the most complete in
the world at the time, they recorded the fragment and scrolls before their
further decay in storage and are often considered the best recorded copies of
the scrolls. Israel Antiquities Authority and NASA digital infrared imaging
(1993-2010). Beginning in 1993, the United States National Aeronautics and
Space Administration used digital infrared imaging technology to produce
photographs of Dead Sea Scrolls fragments. In partnership with the Ancient
Biblical Manuscript Center and West Semitic Research, NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory successfully worked to expand on the use of infrared photography
previously used to evaluate ancient manuscripts by expanding the range of
spectra at which images are photographed. NASA used this multi-spectral imaging
technique, adapted from its remote sensing and planetary probes, in order to
reveal previously illegible text on fragments of the Dead Sea Scrolls. The
process uses a liquid crystal tunable filter in order to photograph the scrolls
at specific wavelengths of light and, as a result, image distortion is
significantly diminished. This method was used with select fragments of the
Dead Sea Scrolls to reveal text and details that cameras that take photographs
using a larger light spectrum could not reveal. The camera and digital imaging
assembly was developed by Greg Berman, a scientist with NASA, specifically for
the purpose of photographing illegible ancient texts. Israel Antiquities
Authority and DNA scroll assembly (2006-2012). Scientists with the Israeli
Antiquities Authority have used DNA from the parchment on which the Dead Sea
Scrolls fragments were written, in concert with infrared digital photography,
to assist in the reassembly of the scrolls. For scrolls written on parchment
made from animal hide any papyrus, scientists with the museum are using DNA
code to associate fragments with different scrolls and to help scholars
determine which scrolls may hold greater significance based on the type of
material that was used. Israel Antiquities Authority and Google digitization
project (2011-2016, Estimated). In partnership with Google, the Israel
Antiquities Authority is working to photograph the Dead Sea Scrolls and make
them available to the public digitally, although not placing the images in the
public domain. The lead photographer of the project, Ardon Bar-Hama, and his
team are utilizing the Alpa 12 MAX camera accompanied with a Leaf Aptus-II back
in order to produce ultra-high resolution digital images of the scrolls and
fragments. With photos taken at 1,200 megapixels, the results are digital
images that can be used to distinguish details that are invisible to the naked
eye. In order to minimize damage to the scrolls and fragments, photographers
are using a 1/4000th of a second exposure time and UV-protected flash tubes.
The digital photography project, estimated in 2011 to cost approximately 3.5
million U.S. dollars, is expected to be completed by 2016. Scholarly
examination and translation. Early study by scholars. After most of the scrolls
and fragments were moved to the Palestinian Archaeological Museum in 1953,
scholars began to assemble them and log them for translation and study in a
room that became known as the "Scrollery". Language and script. The text of the
Dead Sea Scrolls is written in four different languages: Hebrew, Aramaic,
Greek, and Nabataean. Publication. Physical publication. Some of the fragments
and scrolls were published early. Most of the longer, more complete scrolls
were published soon after their discovery. All the writings in Cave 1 appeared
in print between 1950 and 1956; those from eight other caves were released in
1963; and 1965 saw the publication of the Psalms Scroll from Cave 11. Their
translations into English soon followed. Publication of the scrolls has taken
many decades, and delays have been a source of academic controversy. The
majority of the scrolls consist of tiny, brittle fragments, which were
published at a pace considered by many to be excessively slow. During early
assembly and translation work by scholars through the Rockefeller Museum from
the 1950s through the 1960s, access to the unpublished documents was severely
limited to the editorial committee. Discoveries in the Judean Desert (1955-
2009). The content of the scrolls was published in a 40 volume series by Oxford
University Press published between 1955 and 2009 known as Discoveries in the
Judean Desert. In 1952 the Jordanian Department of Antiquities assembled a team
of scholars to begin examining, assembling, and translating the scrolls with
the intent of publishing them. The initial publication, assembled by Dominique
BarthÃ©lemy and JÃ³zef Milik, was published as "Qumran Cave 1" in 1955. After a
series of other publications in the late 1980s and early 1990s and with the
appointment of the respected Dutch-Israeli textual scholar Emanuel Tov as
Editor-in-Chief of the Dead Sea Scrolls Publication Project in 1990 publication
of the scrolls accelerated. Tov's team had published five volumes covering the
Cave 4 documents by 1995. Between 1990 and 2009, Tov helped the team produce 32
volumes. The final volume, Volume XL, was published in 2009. A Preliminary
Edition of the Unpublished Dead Sea Scrolls (1991). In 1991, researchers at
Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati, Ohio, Ben Zion Wacholder and Martin Abegg,
announced the creation of a computer program that used previously published
scrolls to reconstruct the unpublished texts. Officials at the Huntington
Library in San Marino, California, led by Head Librarian William Andrew
Moffett, announced that they would allow researchers unrestricted access to the
libraryâ€™s complete set of photographs of the scrolls. In the fall of that
year, Wacholder published 17 documents that had been reconstructed in 1988 from
a concordance and had come into the hands of scholars outside of the
International Team; in the same month, there occurred the discovery and
publication of a complete set of facsimiles of the Cave 4 materials at the
Huntington Library. Thereafter, the officials of the Israel Antiquities
Authority agreed to lift their long-standing restrictions on the use of the
scrolls. A Facsimile Edition of the Dead Sea Scrolls (1991). After further
delays, attorney William John Cox undertook representation of an "undisclosed
client," who had provided a complete set of the unpublished photographs, and
contracted for their publication. Professors Robert Eisenman and James Robinson
indexed the photographs and wrote an introduction to A Facsimile Edition of the
Dead Sea Scrolls, which was published by the Biblical Archaeology Society in
1991. Following the publication of the Facsimile Edition, Professor Elisha
Qimron sued Hershel Shanks, Eisenman, Robinson and the Biblical Archaeology
Society for copyright infringement of one of the scrolls, MMT, which he
deciphered. The District Court of Jerusalem found in favor of Qimron in
September 1993. The decision met Israeli and international criticism from
copyright law scholars. Dead Sea Scrolls Foundation Facsimiles (2007-2009). In
December 2007 the Dead Sea Scrolls Foundation commissioned through a publisher
in London, England, facsimile editions of "The Great Isaiah Scroll" (1QIsa),
"The Order of the Community" (1QS), and "The Pesher to Habakkuk" (1QpHab). Of
the first three facsimile sets, one was exhibited at the "Early Christianity
and the Dead Sea Scrolls" exhibition in Seoul, South Korea, and a second set
was purchased by the British Library in London. A further 25 sets including
facsimiles of fragments "Testimonia" (4Q175), "Pesher Isaiahb" (4Q162) and
"Qohelet" (4Q109) were announced in May 2009. The foundation has printed 49
numbered sets of these reproductions. Digital publication. Olive Tree Bible
Software (2000-2011). The text of nearly all of the non-biblical scrolls has
been recorded and tagged for morphology by Dr. Martin Abegg, Jr., the Ben Zion
Wacholder Professor of Dead Sea Scroll Studies at Trinity Western University
located in Langley, British Columbia, Canada. It is available on handheld
devices through Olive Tree Bible Software - BibleReader, on Macs and Windows
via emulator through Accordance with a comprehensive set of cross references,
and on Windows through Logos Bible Software and BibleWorks. The Dead Sea
Scrolls Reader (2005). The text of almost all of the non-Biblical texts from
the Dead Sea Scrolls was released on CD-ROM by publisher E.J. Brill in 2005.
The 2400 page, 6 volume series, was assembled by an editorial team led by
Donald W. Parry and Emanuel Tov. Unlike the text translations in the physical
publication, "Discoveries in the Judean Desert," the texts are sorted by genres
that include religious law, parabiblical texts, calendrical and sapiental
texts, and poetic and liturgical works. Israel Antiquities Authority and Google
digitization project (2010-2016). High-resolution images, including infrared
photographs, of some of the Dead Sea scrolls are now available online at the
Israel Museum's website. On 19 October 2010, it was announced that Israeli
Antiquities Authority (IAA) would scan the documents using multi-spectral
imaging technology developed by NASA to produce high-resolution images of the
texts, and then, through a partnership with Google, make them available online
free of charge, on a searchable database and complemented by translation and
other scholarly tools. The first images, which according to the announcement
could reveal new letters and words, are expected to be posted online in the few
months following the announcement, and the project is scheduled for completion
within five years. According to IAA director Pnina Shor, "from the minute all
of this will go online there will be no need to expose the scrolls anymore",
referring to the dark, climate-controlled storeroom where the manuscripts are
kept when not on display. On 25 September 2011 the Digital Dead Sea Scrolls
this site went online. Google and the Israel Museum teamed up on this project,
allowing users to examine and explore these most ancient manuscripts from
Second Temple times at a level of detail never before possible. The new website
gives users access to searchable, high-resolution images of the scrolls, as
well as short explanatory videos and background information on the texts and
their history. As of May 2012, five complete scrolls from the Israel Museum
have been digitized for the project and are now accessible online. These
include the Great Isaiah Scroll, the Community Rule Scroll, the Commentary on
Habakkuk Scroll, the Temple Scroll, and the War Scroll. All five scrolls can be
magnified so that users may examine texts in detail. In context of the Canon of
the Bible. Biblical significance. The significance of the scrolls relates in a
large part to the field of textual criticism and how accurately the Bible has
been transcribed over time. Before the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, the
oldest Hebrew manuscripts of the Bible were Masoretic texts dating to 10th
century AD, such as the Aleppo Codex. Today, the oldest known extant
manuscripts of the Masoretic Text date from approximately the 9th century AD.
The biblical manuscripts found among the Dead Sea Scrolls push that date back a
millennium to the 2nd century BC. Before this discovery, the earliest extant
manuscripts of the Old Testament were manuscripts such as Codex Vaticanus
Graecus 1209 and Codex Sinaiticus (both dating from the 4th century) that were
written in Greek. According to "The Oxford Companion to Archaeology": At the
time of their writing the area was transitioning between Greek and Roman
dominance. The Jewish Qahal (society) had some measure of autonomy following
the death of Alexander and the fracturing of the Greek Empire among his
successors. The country was long called Î™Î¿Ï…Î´Î±Î¯Î± or JudÃ¦a at that time,
named for the Hebrews that returned to dwell there, following the well
documented diaspora. Most scholars believe the Jews actually redacted the
Biblical stories due to the pressures of losing their ethnicity in Babylon, and
picked up the square script there. The majority of Jews never actually returned
to Israel from Babylon and Persia according to the Talmud, oral and
archeological evidence. Museum exhibitions and displays. Temporary public
exhibitions. Small portions of the Dead Sea Scrolls collections have been put
on temporary display in exhibitions at museums and public venues around the
world. The majority of these exhibitions took place in 1965 in the United
States and the United Kingdom and from 1993 to 2011 in locations around the
world. Many of the exhibitions were co-sponsored by either the Jordanian
government (pre-1967) or the Israeli government (post-1967). Exhibitions were
discontinued after 1965 due to the Six-days War conflicts and have slowed down
in post-2011 as the Israeli Antiquities Authority works to digitize the scrolls
and place them in permanent cold storage. Long-term museum exhibitions. Display
at the Shrine of the Book at the Israel Museum, Jerusalem. Since its completion
in April 1965, the majority of the Dead Sea Scrolls collection has been moved
to the Shrine of the Book, a part of the Israel Museum, located in Jerusalem.
The museum falls under the auspices of the Israel Antiquities Authority, an
official agency of the Israeli government. The permanent Dead Sea Scrolls
exhibition at the museum features a reproduction of the Great Isaiah Scroll,
surrounded by reproductions of other famous fragments that include Community
Rule, the War Scroll, and the Thanksgiving Psalms Scroll. Display at the Jordan
Museum, Amman, Jordan. Some of the Dead Sea Scrolls collection held by the
Jordian government prior to 1967 was stored in Amman rather than at the
Palestinian Archaeological Museum in East Jerusalem. As a consequence, that
part of the collection remained in Jordanian hands under their Department of
Antiquities. Parts of this collection are anticipated to be on display at the
Jordan Museum in Amman after the documents move. They were moved there in
between June 2011 and August 2011 from the National Archaeological Museum of
Jordan. Among the display items are artificats from the Qumran site and the
Copper Scroll. Ownership. Past ownership. Arrangements with the Bedouin left
the scrolls in the hands of a third party until a profitable sale of them could
be negotiated. That third party, George Isha'ya, was a member of the Syrian
Orthodox Church, who soon contacted St. Mark's Monastery in the hope of getting
an appraisal of the nature of the texts. News of the find then reached
Metropolitan Athanasius Yeshue Samuel, better known as Mar Samuel. After
examining the scrolls and suspecting their antiquity, Mar Samuel expressed an
interest in purchasing them. Four scrolls found their way into his hands: the
now famous "Isaiah Scroll" (1QIsaa), the "Community Rule", the "Habakkuk
Pesher" (a commentary on the book of Habakkuk), and the "Genesis Apocryphon".
More scrolls soon surfaced in the antiquities market, and Professor Eleazer
Sukenik and Professor Benjamin Mazar, Israeli archaeologists at Hebrew
University, soon found themselves in possession of three, "The War Scroll",
"Thanksgiving Hymns", and another, more fragmented, Isaiah scroll (1QIsab).
Four of the Dead Sea Scrolls went up for sale eventually, in an advertisement
in the 1 June 1954, "Wall Street Journal." On 1 July 1954, the scrolls, after
delicate negotiations and accompanied by three people including the
Metropolitan, arrived at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York. They were
purchased by Professor Mazar and the son of Professor Sukenik, Yigael Yadin,
for $250,000, approximately $2.14 million in 2012, and brought to Jerusalem.
Current ownership. Most of the Dead Sea Scrolls collection is currently under
the ownership of the Government of the state of Israel, and housed in the
Shrine of the Book on the grounds of the Israel Museum. This ownership is
contested by both Jordan and Palestine. Ownership disputes. The official
ownership of the Dead Sea Scrolls is disputed among the Hashemite Kingdom of
Jordan, the State of Israel, and the Palestinian Authority. The debate over the
Dead Sea Scrolls stems from a more general Israeli-Palestinian conflict over
land and state recognition. Copyright disputes. There are three types of
documents relating to the Dead Sea Scrolls in which copyright status can be
considered ambiguous. The documents themselves, images taken of the documents,
and reproductions of the documents. This ambiguity arises from differences in
copyright law across different countries and the variable interpretation of
such law. Copyright of the original scrolls and translations, Qimron v. Shanks
(1992). In 1992 a copyright case "Qimron v. Shanks" was brought before the
Israeli District court by scholar Elisha Qimron against Hershel Shanks of the
Biblical Archaeology Society for violations of United States copyright law
regarding his publishing of reconstructions of Dead Sea Scroll texts done by
Qimron in "A Facsimile Edition of the Dead Sea Scrolls" which were included
without his permission. Qimron's suit against the Biblical Archaeology Society
was done on the grounds that the research they had published was his
intellectual property as he had reconstructed about 40% of the published text.
In 1993, the district court Judge Dalia Dorner ruled for the plaintiff, Elisha
Qimron, in context of both United States and Israeli copyright law and granted
the highest compensation allowed by law for aggravation in compensation against
Hershel Shanks and others. An appeal in 2000 in front of Judge Aharon Barak the
verdict was upheld in Israeli Supreme Court in Qimron's favor. The court case
established the two main principles from which facsimiles are examined under
copyright law of the United States and Israel: authorship and originality. The
courts ruling not only affirms that the "deciphered text" of the scrolls can
fall under copyright of individuals or groups, but makes it clear that the Dead
Sea Scrolls themselves do not fall under this copyright law and scholars have a
degree of, in the words of David Nimmer, "freedom" in access. Nimmer shows how
this freedom was in the theory of law applicable, but how it did not exist in
reality as the Israeli Antiquities Authority tightly controlled access to the
scrolls and photographs of the scrolls.
