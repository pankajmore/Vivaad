Crypto-Judaism Crypto-Judaism is the secret adherence to Judaism while publicly
professing to be of another faith; practitioners are referred to as "crypto-
Jews" (origin from Greek kryptos - Œ∫œÅœÖœÄœÑœåœÇ, 'hidden'). The term crypto-
Jew is also used to describe descendants who maintain some Jewish traditions of
their ancestors, often secretly, while publicly adhering to other faiths, most
commonly Catholicism. The phenomenon is especially associated with early modern
Spain, following the expulsion of the Jews in 1492. Europe. Officially, Jews
who converted in Spain in the 14th and 15th centuries were known as "Cristianos
Nuevos" (New Christians), but were commonly called "conversos". Spain and
Portugal passed legislation restricting their rights in the mother countries
and colonies. Despite the dangers of the Inquisition, many "conversos"
continued to secretly and discreetly practice Jewish rituals. In the Balearic
Islands, numerous "conversos", also called Chuetas, publicly professed Roman
Catholicism but privately adhered to Judaism after the Alhambra decree of 1492
and during the Spanish Inquisition. They are among the most widely-known
crypto-Jews. Crypto-Judaism dates back to earlier periods when Jews were forced
or pressured to convert by the rulers of places they lived in. Some of the
Jewish followers of Sabbatai Zevi (Sabbateans) formally converted to Islam, and
later followers of Jacob Frank ("Frankists") formally converted to
Christianity, but maintained aspects of their versions of Messianic Judaism.
Crypto-Jews persisted in Russia and Eastern European countries influenced by
the Soviet Union after the rise of Communism with the Russian Revolution of
1917. Rather than being forced to convert, all religion was regarded as
undesirable, although some faiths were allowed to continue under strict
supervision by the regime. Since the end of Communism, many people in former
Soviet states, including descendants of Jews, have publicly taken up the faith
of their families again. The "Belmonte Jews" of Portugal, dating from the 12th
century, maintained strong secret traditions for centuries. A whole community
survived in secrecy by maintaining a tradition of intermarriage and hiding all
external signs of their faith. They and their practices were discovered only in
the 20th century. Their rich Sephardic tradition of Crypto-Judaism is unique.
Only recently did they contact other Jews. Some now profess Orthodox Judaism,
although many still retain their centuries-old traditions. Xuetes. The Xueta
are a minority on the Balearic island of Majorca (Mallorca) who are descended
almost entirely from crypto-Jews, forced to convert in 1391. The term "xueta"
literally translates to "pig" in Catalan, similar to the old Spanish
(Castilian) term and "marrano", both of the same meaning. Today, they comprise
a population of 20,000‚Äì25,000 on an island of 750,000; they have professed
Roman Catholicism for centuries but have only recently seen a lessening in
tensions with ethnic Majorcans. According to some Orthodox rabbis, the majority
of Xuetes are probably Jewish under Jewish law (by descent from Jewish mothers)
due to the low rate of intermarriage with outside groups. Only recently have
intermarriages between the two groups been more prevalent or noticeable. During
World War II, Nazi Germany was known to have pressured Majorcan religious
authorities into surrendering the Xuetes, targeted because of their Jewish
ancestry. Reportedly the religious authorities refused the Nazi request.
Several Xuetes are reported to have "reconverted" to Judaism. Some have become
rabbis. Neofiti. The Neofiti were a group of crypto-Jews living in the Kingdom
of Sicily which not only included the island of Sicily but nearly all of
Southern Italy from the 13th to the 16th centuries. Asia. There are, or have
been, several communities of Crypto-Jews in Muslim lands. The ancestors of the
Daggatuns probably kept up their Jewish practises a long time after their
nominal adoption of Islam. A large community of Crypto-Jews lived in Mashhad,
near Khorassan, where they were known as "Jedid al-Islam", who were mass-
converted to Islam around 1839. Most of this community left for Israel in 1946,
but some have converted into Muslims and live in Iran today. In the central
Iranian village of Sebe, local Muslims practice many Jewish customs, such as
women lighting a candle on Friday night (the eve of the Jewish Sabbath). Before
sundown on Friday, they prepare a small fire which they leave on throughout
Saturday, so as not to ignite the fire on Sabbath. North America. There are
three distinct historical components to colonial roots of crypto-Judaism,
largely restricted to Spanish-held territories in Mexico, each with distinct
geographical and temporal aspects: early colonial roots, the frontier province
of Nuevo Le√≥n, and the later northern frontier provinces. The crypto-Jewish
traditions have complex histories and are typically embedded in an amalgam of
syncretic Roman Catholic and Judaic traditions. In many ways resurgent Judaic
practices mirrored indigenous peoples' maintaining their traditions practiced
loosely under Roman Catholic veil. In addition, Catholicism was syncretic,
absorbing other traditions and creating a new creole religion. Early colonial
period ‚Äî 16th century. However, Portugal in 1497 issued a similar decree that
effectively converted all remaining Jewish children, making them wards of the
state unless the parents also converted. Therefore, many of the early crypto-
Jewish migrants to Mexico in the early colonial days were technically first to
second generation Portuguese with Spanish roots before that. The number of such
Portuguese migrants was significant enough that the label of "Portuguese"
became synonymous with "Jewish" throughout the Spanish colonies. Immigration to
Mexico offered lucrative trade possibilities in a well-populated colony with
nascent Spanish culture counterbalanced by a large non-Christian population.
Migrants thought the culture would be more tolerant since the lands were
overwhelmingly populated by non-Christian indigenous peoples. Colonial
officials believed that many crypto-Jews were going to Mexico during the 16th
century and complained in written documents to Spain that Spanish society in
Mexico would become significantly Jewish. Officials found and condemned
clandestine synagogues in Mexico City. At this point, colonial administrators
instituted the Law of the Pure Blood, which prohibited migration to Mexico for
New Christians (Cristiano Nuevo), i.e. anyone who could not prove to be Old
Christians for at least the last three generations. During this time, the
administration initiated the Mexican Inquisition to ensure the Catholic
orthodoxy of all migrants into Mexico. The Mexico Inquisition was also deployed
in the traditional manner to ensure orthodoxy of converted indigenous peoples.
The first victims of burnings or autos de f√© of the Mexican Inquisition were
indigenous converts convicted of heresy or crypto-Jews convicted of relapsing
into their ancestral faith. Except for the province of "Nuevo Le√≥n",
initiation of the Blood Purity Laws reduced the migration of conversos. Nuevo
Le√≥n ‚Äî 1590s to early 17th century. The history of the colonization of
Mexico can be described as a northward expansion over increasingly hostile
geography well-populated by angered tribes and loose confederations of
indigenous peoples being conquered. Spain financed the expansion by exploiting
mineral wealth, using indigenous peoples as labor in mines, and establishing
"ranchos" for raising livestock. One troublesome region was a large expanse
covering the North-Eastern quadrant of New Spain (Nueva Espa√±a). Chichimec,
Apache and other tribes were resistant to Christianization and "settling". They
were perceived to render the frontier ("frontera") a lawless and unsettled
region. Luis Carvajal y de la Cueva was a Portuguese New Christian royal
accountant who received a royal charter to settle Nuevo Le√≥n, a large expanse
of land in the hostile frontier. Significantly, in the charter Carvajal y de la
Cueva received an exemption from the usual requirement that he prove that all
new settlers were "old Christians" rather than recently converted Jews or
Muslims. This exemption allowed people, especially Crypto-Jews, to come to
Nuevo Le√≥n who were legally barred from entering New Spain elsewhere. Many of
the 100 soldiers and 60 laborers Carabajal was authorized to bring to New Spain
were Crypto-Jews. With Carvajal as governor, Monterrey was established as the
center, currently in the state of Nuevo Le√≥n. Within a few years, some people
reported to Mexico City that Jewish rites were being performed in the Northern
Province and efforts to convert heathen indigenous peoples were lax. The
principal economic activity of Carvajal and his associates seems to have been
capturing Indians and selling them into slavery. Carvajal's Lieutenant
Governor, Gaspar Casta√±o de Sosa, led a large expedition to New Mexico in 1591
in an effort to establish a colony. Casta√±o was arrested for this unauthorized
expedition and sentenced to exile in the Philippines. The sentence was later
reversed but he had already been killed in a slave revolt. The governor, his
immediate family members, and others of his entourage were called to appear
before the Inquisition in Mexico City. They were arrested and jailed. The
governor subsequently died in jail, while his family members were
rehabilitated. One of these was Anna Carvajal, a niece of the Governor. She and
others were later again taken captive and sentenced to burning at the stake for
relapsing. The governor's nephews changed their name to Lumbroso. One of these
was Joseph Lumbroso, also known as Luis de Carvajal el Mozo, who is said to
have circumcised himself in the desert to conform to Jewish law. His memoirs,
letters and inquisition record survive. Two other nephews also changed their
names to Lumbroso and migrated to Italy, where they became famous rabbis. When
Governor Carvajal was in office, the city of Monterrey became a destination for
other crypto-Jews feeling the pressure of the Mexican Inquisition in the south
of the territory. Thus, the story of Nuevo Le√≥n and the founding of Monterrey
are significant as it attracted crypto-Jewish migrants from all parts of New
Spain. They created one of the earliest Jewish-related communities in earlier
Mexico. (The Jewish communities in modern Mexico which practice their Judaism
openly were not established until the considerable immigration from eastern
Europe, Turkey and Syria in the late 19th century and 20th century.) Former
Mexican territories in the modern-day southwestern U.S. 17th century‚Äì18th
century. Due to the activities of the Mexican Inquisition in Nuevo Le√≥n, many
crypto-Jewish descendants migrated to other frontier colonies further west to
the trade routes passing through the towns of Sierra Madres Occidental and
Chihuahua, Hermosillo and Cananea (Canaan) and further north on the trade route
to Paso del Norte (Juarez/El Paso) and Santa Fe (both cities in the then
colonial Province of New Mexico), Bisbee Arizona and somewhat less in Alta
California. In the former Spanish-held northern New Spain (modern-day
Southwestern United States), some Hispanic Roman Catholics have stated a belief
that they are descended from crypto-Jews and have started practicing Judaism.
They often cite as evidence memories of older relatives practicing Jewish
traditions. The crypto-Jews of New Mexico have been documented by several
research scholars including Stanley M. Hordes, Janet Liebman Jacobs, Schulamith
Halevy, and Seth D. Kunin. Only one researcher, folklorist Judith Neulander,
has been skeptical of the authenticity of the Jewish ancestry of Hispanos of
the Southwest, she argues that these remembered traditions could be those of
Ashkenazi, not Sephardi, Jews and may possibly be constructed memories due to
suggestion by proponents. She also argues that the Jewish traditions practiced
by older relatives were introduced by groups of Evangelical Protestant
Christians who purposely acquired and employed Jewish traditions as part of
their religious practices. Neulander's theory has been directly addressed in
Kunin's book "Juggling Identities: Identity and Authenticity Among the Crypto-
Jews". More recently, Evangelical Protestant Christians have opened missionary
groups aimed at cultivating evangelical doctrine in Southwestern American
communities where crypto-Judaism had survived. Current times. According to a
recent study (December 2008) published in the American Journal of Human
Genetics, 19.8 percent of modern Spaniards (and Portuguese) have DNA reflecting
Sephardic Jewish ancestry (compared to 10.6 percent having DNA reflecting
Moorish ancestors.. The Sephardic result is in contradiction or not replicated
in all the body of genetic studies done in Iberia and has been relativized by
the authors themselves and questioned by Stephen Oppenheimer who estimate that
much earlier migrations, 5,000 to 10,000 years ago from the Eastern
Mediterranean might also have accounted for the Sephardic estimates. "They are
really assuming that they are looking at this migration of Jewish immigrants,
but the same lineages could have been introduced in the Neolithic". The same
authors in also a recent study (October 2008) attributed most of those same
lineages in Iberia and the Balearic Islands as of Phoenician origin.The rest of
genetic studies done in Spain estimate the Moorish contribution ranging from
2.5/3.4% to 7.7%. Recent genetic research, however, has shown that many Latinos
of the American Southwest may be descended from Anusim (Sephardic Jews who
converted to Roman Catholicism). Michael Hammer, a research professor at the
University of Arizona and an expert on Jewish genetics, said that fewer than 1%
of non-Semites, but more than four times the entire Jewish population of the
world, possessed the male-specific "Cohanim marker" (which in itself is not
necessarily carried by all Jews, but is prevalent among Jews claiming descent
from hereditary priests), and 30 of 78 Latinos tested in New Mexico (38.5%)
were found to be carriers. DNA testing of Hispanic populations also revealed
between 10% and 15% of men living in New Mexico, south Texas and northern
Mexico have a Y chromosome that traces back to the Middle East. There is no
certainty that these lineages are Middle Eastern, as they could also be of
earlier Phoenician and later North African influence. Tunisians also rank very
high with the Y- chromosome marker that is related to conahim. There could be a
North African connection for this as well. There is no specific Jewish DNA
marker and with so much moorish and Phoenician settlement in Spain one cannot
tell the religion of the bearers ancestors. In northern Mexico, Monterrey, the
capital city of the state of Nuevo Le√≥n, that shares a border with Texas, is
said to contain descendants of Crypto-Jews. The church in Agualeguas, Nuevo
Le√≥n, Mexico indeed has Star of David windows beneath the Christian cross atop
the domed roof. The state of Jalisco has several cities with large numbers of
Anusim, mainly Guadalajara, Ciudad Guzm√°n, and Puerto Vallarta, although a
steady influx of Ashkenazi Jews from Eastern Europe during the late 19th
century and early to mid-20th century into Mexico City, Guadalajara, and
Veracruz is also widely known. In the Old Town area of Albuquerque New Mexico,
the San Felipe de Neri Catholic Church, built in 1793 to replace the original
1706 mission church, contains a Star of David on the left and right sides of
the altar; evidence of the influence of Crypto-Jews in New Mexico. Many Jewish
symbols can be found on cemetery headstones in Northern New Mexico, along side
Catholic crosses. Today, there are about 40,000 Mexican Jews, both Ashkenazi
and Sephardi. Researchers and historians say that number would rise
considerably if Anusim (or Crypto-Jews) were included in those estimates.
Central, South America and Caribbean. As in the American Southwest, in the
department of Antioquia, Colombia, as well as in the greater Paisa region, many
families also hold traditions and oral accounts of Jewish descent. In this
population, Y chromosome genetic analysis has shown an origin of founders
predominantly from "southern Spain but also suggest that a fraction came from
northern Iberia and that some possibly had a Sephardic origin". The Medell√≠n
tradition of the "marranada", where a pig is slaughtered, butchered and
consumed on the streets of every neighborhood each Christmas has been
interpreted as an annual affirmation of the rejection of Jewish law. A safe
haven destination for Sephardic Conversos during the Spanish Colony was Santa
Cruz de la Sierra. In 1557 many Crypto-Jews joined √ëuflo de Ch√°vez and were
among the pioneers who founded the city. During the 16th century several
Crypto-Jews that faced persecution from the Inquisition and local authorities
in nearby Potos√≠, La Paz and La Plata also moved to Santa Cruz for it was the
most isolated urban settlement and because the Inquisition did not bother the
Conversos there for this frontier town was meant to be a buffer to the
Portuguese and Guaran√≠ raids that threatened the mines of Peru. Several of
them settled in the city of Santa Cruz and its adjacent towns of Vallegrande,
Postrervalle, Portachuelo, Terevinto, Pucar√ , Bolivia, Cotoca and others.
Several of the oldest Catholic families in Santa Cruz are in fact of Jewish
origin; some traces of Judaic practices are still alive among them and have
also influence the rest of the community. As recent as the 1920s, several
families preserved seven-branched candle sticks and served dishes cooked with
reminiscing kosher practices. It is still customary among certain old families
to light candles on Friday at sunset and to mourn the deaths of dear relatives
on the floor. After almost five centuries, some of the descendants of these
families still acknowledge their Jewish origin, but practice Catholicism (in
certain cases with some Jewish syncretism). Some Crypto-Jews established in the
outskirts of San Jos√©, Costa Rica since the XVI century. They passed as
Catholics in public and practiced their Jewish rituals in privacy. In the town
of Itzkaz√∫ (modern day Escaz√∫) some Crypto-Jewish families could not achieve
total secrecy of their condition and locals started to associate their rituals
and unintelligible prayers in Hebrew as witchcraft. Since then, Escaz√∫ has
been known in Costarrican folklore as the ¬®city of the witches¬®. In addition
to these communities, Roman Catholic-professing communities who are descendants
of Crypto-Jews are said to exist in the Dominican Republic, Cuba, Jamaica,
Puerto Rico and in various other Spanish-speaking countries of South America,
such as Argentina, Venezuela, Chile and Ecuador. From these communities comes
the proverb, "Catholic by faith, Jewish by blood". All the above localities
were former territories of either the Spanish or Portuguese Empires, where the
Inquisition eventually followed and continued investigating Crypto-Jews who had
settled there. The Inquisition endured longer in the colonies than it had in
Spain itself.
