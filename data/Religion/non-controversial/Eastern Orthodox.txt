Eastern Orthodox Church The Eastern Orthodox Church, officially called the
Orthodox Catholic Church and commonly referred to as the Orthodox Church, is
the second largest Christian church in the world, with an estimated 300 million
adherents, primarily in Eastern and Southeastern Europe. It is the religious
denomination of the majority of the populations of Russia, Belarus, Ukraine,
Moldova, Georgia, Romania, Serbia, Montenegro, Macedonia, Bulgaria, Greece, and
Cyprus. It teaches that it is the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church
established by Jesus Christ and his Apostles almost 2,000 years ago. The
Orthodox Church is composed of several self-governing ecclesial bodies, each
geographically and nationally distinct but theologically unified. Each self-
governing (or autocephalous) body, often but not always encompassing a nation,
is shepherded by a Holy Synod whose duty, among other things, is to preserve
and teach the apostolic and traditions and related church practices. Like the
Roman Catholic Church, Anglican Communion, Assyrian Church of the East,
Oriental Orthodoxy and some other churches, Orthodox bishops trace their
lineage back to the apostles through the process of apostolic succession. The
Orthodox Church traces its development back through the Byzantine or Roman
empire, to the earliest church established by St. Paul and the Apostles. It
practices what it understands to be the original ancient traditions, believing
in growth without change. In non-doctrinal matters the church had occasionally
shared from local Greek, Slavic and Middle Eastern traditions, among others, in
turn shaping the cultural development of these nations. The goal of Orthodox
Christians from baptism is to continually draw themselves nearer to God
throughout their lives. This process is called theosis, or deification, and is
a spiritual pilgrimage in which each person strives to both become more holy
through the imitation of Christ and cultivation of the inner life through
unceasing prayer (most famously, the Jesus Prayer) or "hesychasm", until united
at death with the fire of God's love. The Biblical text used by the Orthodox
includes the Greek Septuagint and the New Testament. It includes the seven
Deuterocanonical Books which are generally rejected by Protestants and a small
number of other books that are in neither Western canon. Orthodox Christians
use the term "Anagignoskomena" (a Greek word that means "readable", "worthy of
reading") for the ten books that they accept but that are not in the Protestant
39-book Old Testament canon. They regard them as venerable, but on a lesser
level than the 39 books of the Hebrew canon. They do, however, use some of them
liturgically. Orthodox Christians believe Scripture was revealed by the Holy
Spirit to its inspired human authors. The Scriptures are not, however, the
source of the traditions associated with the Church but rather the opposite;
the biblical text came out of that tradition. It is also not the only important
book of the Church. There are literally hundreds of early patristic writings
that form part of Church tradition. Icons can be found adorning the walls of
Orthodox churches and hagiographies often cover the inside structure
completely. Many Orthodox homes have an area set aside for family prayer, the
icon corner, on which icons of Christ, the Virgin Mary and the Saints are
placed typically on an Eastern facing wall. Definition. Almost from the very
beginning, Christians referred to the Church as the "One, Holy, Catholic the
Greek καθολική, or "according to the whole" and Apostolic Church".
Today, in addition to the Orthodox Church, a number of other Christian churches
lay claim to this title (including the Catholic Church, the Anglican Communion,
the Assyrian Church and the Oriental Orthodox Church); however, the Orthodox
Church considers these other churches to be schismatic and, in some cases,
heretical. In the Orthodox view, the Assyrians and Orientals left the Orthodox
Church in the first few centuries after Christ, and later the Catholics did the
same, becoming the largest ever group to leave the Church. This event is known
as the East–West Schism, and it is traditionally dated to the year 1054,
although it was more of a gradual process than a sudden break. "Orthodox", from
Greek "orthos" ("right", "true", "straight") + "doxa" ("opinion" or "belief",
related to "dokein", "to think") was adopted by the Church in order to
distinguish itself from what was becoming a larger and larger body of non-
orthodox Christian denominations. Several other ancient churches in Eastern
Europe, Western Asia and North Africa also use "Orthodox", but are distinct
from the Orthodox Church as described in this article. Typica. What unites the
Orthodox is theology. All members of the Church profess the same beliefs
regardless of race or nationality. In practice and traditions, though, there
are variations in style depending on country of origin or local custom or both.
These local customs are referred to as differences in typica (Style) and are
accepted by the Church since such differences do not conflict with basic
Orthodox Theology. Thus many Orthodox Churches adopt a national title (e.g.
Albanian Orthodox, Bulgarian Orthodox, Syrian Orthodox, Georgian Orthodox,
Greek Orthodox, Macedonian Orthodox, Montenegrin Orthodox, Romanian Orthodox,
Russian Orthodox, Serbian Orthodox, Ukrainian Orthodox etc.) and this title
serves to distinguish which language, which bishops, and which of the typica is
followed by that particular . In the Middle East, Orthodox Christians have also
been often referred as Roman (or "Rum") Orthodox, because of their historical
connection with the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire as said in Chapter 30
(Sura Rum) of the Quran. Members of the Church are fully united in faith and
the Sacred Mysteries with all Orthodox congregations, regardless of
nationality. Differences in "praxis" (practice) tend to be slight; they involve
such things as the order in which a particular set of hymns are sung or what
time a particular service is celebrated. In general, an Orthodox Christian
could travel the globe and feel familiar with the services even if he or she
did not know the language in which they were celebrated. Organization and
leadership. The permanent criteria of church structure for the Orthodox Church
today, outside the New Testament writings, are found in the canons (regulation
and decrees) of the first seven ecumenical councils; the canons of several
local or provincial councils, whose authority was recognized by the whole
church; the Apostolic Canons, dating from the 4th century); and the "canons of
the Fathers" or selected extracts from prominent church leaders having
canonical importance. The Orthodox Church considers Jesus Christ to be the head
of the Church and the Church to be His body. Thus, despite widely held popular
belief outside the Orthodox cultures, there is not one bishop at the head of
the Orthodox Church; references to the Patriarch of Constantinople as a leader
equivalent or comparable to a pope in the Roman Catholic Church are mistaken.
It is believed that authority and the grace of God is directly passed down to
Orthodox bishops and clergy through the laying on of hands—a practice started
by the apostles, and that this unbroken historical and physical link is an
essential element of the true church (Acts 8:17, 1 Tim 4:14, Heb 6:2). However,
the church asserts that Apostolic Succession also requires Apostolic Faith, and
bishops without Apostolic Faith, who are in heresy, forfeit their claim to
Apostolic Succession. Each bishop has a territory (see) over which he governs.
His main duty is to make sure the traditions and practices of the Church are
preserved. Bishops are equal in authority and cannot interfere in the
jurisdiction of another bishop. Administratively, these bishops and their
territories are organized into various autocephalous groups or synods of
bishops who gather together at least twice a year to discuss the state of
affairs within their respective sees. While bishops and their autocephalous
synods have the ability to administer guidance in individual cases, their
actions do not usually set precedents that affect the entire Church. Bishops
are almost always chosen from the monastic ranks and must remain unmarried.
There have been a number of times when alternative theological ideas arose to
challenge the Orthodox faith. At such times the Church deemed it necessary to
convene a general or "Great" council of all available bishops throughout the
world. The Church considers the first seven Ecumenical Councils (held between
the 4th and the 8th century) to be the most important; however, there have been
more, specifically the Synods of Constantinople, 879–880, 1341, 1347, 1351,
1583, 1819, and 1872, the Synod of Iaşi (Jassy), 1642, and the Pan-Orthodox
Synod of Jerusalem, 1672, all of which helped to define the Orthodox position.
The ecumenical councils followed a democratic form; with each bishop having one
vote. Though present and allowed to speak before the council, members of the
Imperial Roman/Byzantine court, abbots, priests, monks and laymen were not
allowed to vote. The primary goal of these Great Synods was to verify and
confirm the fundamental beliefs of the Church as truth, and to remove as heresy
any false teachings that would threaten the Church. The Pope of Rome, at that
time, held the position of “first among equals”. And while he was not
present at any of the councils he continued to hold this title until the East-
West Schism of 1054 AD. According to Orthodox teaching the position of “First
Among Equals” gives no additional power or authority to the bishop that holds
it, but rather that this person sits as organizational head of a council of
equals (like a president). His words and opinions carry no more insight or
wisdom than any other bishop. It is believed that the Holy Spirit guides the
Church through the decisions of the entire council, not one individual.
Additionally it is understood that even the council’s decisions must be
accepted by the entire Church in order for them to be valid. One of the
decisions made by the First Council of Constantinople (the second ecumenical
council, meeting in 381) and supported by later such councils was that the
Patriarch of Constantinople should be given equal honor to the Pope of Rome
since Constantinople was considered to be the "New Rome". According to the
third Canon of the second ecumenical council: "Because it is new Rome, the
bishop of Constantinople is to enjoy the privileges of honor "after" the bishop
of Rome." This means that both enjoy the same privileges because they are both
bishops of the imperial capitals, but the bishop of Rome will precede the
bishop of Constantinople since Old Rome precedes New Rome. The 28th canon of
the fourth ecumenical council clarified this point by stating: "For the Fathers
rightly granted privileges to the throne of Old Rome because it was the royal
city. And the One Hundred and Fifty most religious Bishops (i.e. the second
ecumenical council in 381) actuated by the same consideration, gave equal
privileges to the most holy throne of New Rome, justly judging that the city
which is honored with the Sovereignty and the Senate, and enjoys equal
privileges with the old imperial Rome, should in ecclesiastical matters also be
magnified as she is." The Pope of Rome would still have honorary primacy before
Constantinople if the East-West Schism had not occurred. Because of that schism
the Orthodox no longer recognize the legitimacy of the pope. The Patriarch
therefore, like the Pope before him now enjoys the title of “first among
equals”. This is not, however, meant to imply that he is the leader of the
Orthodox Church. Also, this is not an official title of any sort, just a way of
describing the seniority of the "imperial" bishops with respect to all other
bishops. Number of adherents. [[File:Orthodoxy by

Christianity (in blue) and Oriental Orthodoxy (in red) in the world by country
Based on the numbers of adherents, Orthodoxy is the second largest Christian
communion in the world after the Roman Catholic Church. The most common
estimates of the number of Orthodox Christians worldwide is approximately 300
million. The numerous Protestant groups in the world, if taken all together,
outnumber the Orthodox, but they differ theologically and do not form a single
communion. Orthodoxy is the largest single religious faith in Greece (95%) and
in Eastern Europe, including Moldova (93%), Georgia (89%), Romania (87%),
Belarus (85%), Serbia (84%), Bulgaria (83%), Cyprus (80%), Ukraine (80%),
Russia (75%), Montenegro (74%), and Macedonia (65%). The number of Orthodox
adherents represents about 38% of the population in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In
Albania the adherents number around 25% out of a 40% Christian population, the
others being Roman Catholic. As the dominant religion in northern Kazakhstan,
it represents 40% of Kazakhstan, and 4% of Lithuania and 13% of the Estonian
population. Large Orthodox Christian communities exist in the Mediterranean
countries of Lebanon (8% of the whole Lebanese population) Jordan (80% of
Christian population), Israel, the West Bank and Gaza Strip (Palestinian
Christians) with some families able to trace their ancestry to the earliest
Christians of the Holy Land. Orthodox minorities live in Poland, Slovakia,
Hungary (Romanian minority), Turkey and Azerbaijan. In addition, there are also
significant Eastern Orthodox communities in the rest of Europe (including the
transplanted Greek, Romanian, Serbian, Macedonian, Albanian, Bulgarian and
Russian communities), Africa, Asia (see the Orthodox Church of China and
Orthodox Church of Japan), Australia, and North America through the pattern of
immigration from Eastern Europe and the Middle East in the last 400 or some
years. In USA and Canada the Orthodox minority is growing and at present
comprises between 1% and 5% of the total population. Ancient Eastern Orthodox
communities still have large populations in countries such as Lebanon and
Israel (Jerusalem and Bethlehem). Large Orthodox communities with ancient
histories have been completely removed from some of their ancestral homes and
therefore no longer have a presence in those locations, specifically Anatolia
and Cappadocia. Beliefs. Trinity. Orthodox Christians believe in the Trinity.
The Holy Trinity is three, distinct, divine persons ("hypostases"), without
overlap or modality among them, who share one divine essence
("ousia")—uncreated, immaterial and eternal. Each of these three persons is
typically identified by its relation to some other. The Father is eternal and
not born or preceded, the Son is eternal and born by the Father, and the Holy
Spirit proceeds from the Father and is also eternal. Orthodox doctrine
regarding the Holy Trinity is summarized in the Nicene Creed (Symbol of Faith).
In discussing God's relationship to His creation, Orthodoxy used the concept of
a distinction between God's eternal essence which is totally transcendent and
His "uncreated energies" which is how He reaches us. The God who is
transcendent and the God who touches us are one and the same (i.e. these
energies are not something that proceed from God or that God produces, but
rather they are God himself: distinct, yet inseparable from, God's inner
being). Sin, salvation and the incarnation. At some point in the beginnings of
human existence man was faced with a choice: to learn the difference between
good and evil through observation or through participation. The biblical story
of Adam and Eve represents this choice by mankind to participate in evil. This
event is commonly referred to as the "fall of man" and it represents a
fundamental change in human nature. When Orthodox Christians refer to Fallen
Nature they believe that human nature is open to acts of evil, and not that the
humaneness joins with evil. They reject the Augustinian position that the
descendants of Adam and Eve are actually guilty of their sin. As a result of
this sin, mankind was doomed to be separated from God. This was mankind's
ultimate dilemma. The solution to this problem was for God to effect another
change in human nature. Orthodox Christians believe that Christ Jesus was both
God and Man absolutely. He was born, lived, died, and rose again by the power
of the Holy Spirit. Through God's participation in humanity, human nature is
changed thus saving us from the fate of Hell (Orthodox reject the idea that
Christ died to give God "satisfaction", as taught by Anselm, or as a punitive
substitute as taught by the Reformers). The effective change included all those
who had died from the beginning of time – saving everyone including Adam and
Eve. This process, to Orthodox Christians, is what is meant by "salvation". The
ultimate goal is theosis – an even closer union with God and closer likeness
to God than existed in the Garden of Eden. This very process is called
Deification or "God became man that man might become 'god'". However, it must
be emphasized that Orthodox Christians do not believe that man literally
becomes God in His essence, or a god. More accurately, Christ's salvific work
enables man to become "partakers of the Divine nature" (2 Peter 1:4); that is
to say, man is united to God in Christ. Resurrection of Christ. The
Resurrection of Christ is the central event in the liturgical year of the
Orthodox Church and is understood in literal terms as a real historical event.
Jesus Christ, the Son of God, was crucified and died, descended into Hades,
rescued all the souls held there through sin; and then, because Hades could not
restrain the infinite God, rose from the dead, thus saving the human race.
Through these events, Christ released us from the bonds of Hades and then came
back to the living as both man and God. According to Orthodox tradition, each
human being may partake of this immortality, which would have been impossible
without the Resurrection; it is the main promise held out by God in the New
Testament. Every holy day of the Orthodox liturgical year relates to the
Resurrection directly or indirectly. Every Sunday is dedicated to celebrating
the Resurrection and the triune God. In the liturgical commemorations of the
Passion of Christ during Holy Week there are frequent allusions to the ultimate
victory at its completion. Bible, holy tradition and the patristic consensus.
The Orthodox Church regards itself as the historical and organic continuation
of the original Church founded by Christ and His apostles. The faith taught by
Jesus to the apostles, given life by the Holy Spirit at Pentecost, and passed
down to future generations uncorrupted, is known as "Holy Tradition". The
primary and authoritative witness to Holy Tradition is the Bible, texts written
by the apostles or those in the Early Church, and approved by Church leaders
under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. The Bible reveals God's will, the
relationship between the Israelites and God, the wonders of Christ and the
early history of the Church. As the Bible has an inspired origin it is central
to the life of the Church. Scriptures are understood to contain historical
fact, poetry, idiom, metaphor, simile, moral fable, parable, prophecy, and
wisdom literature. Thus, the Scriptures are never used for personal
interpretation, but always seen within the context of Holy Tradition, which
gave birth to the Scripture. Orthodoxy maintains that belief in a doctrine of
"sola scriptura" would lead most to error since the truth of Scripture cannot
be separated from the traditions from which it arose. Orthodox Christians
therefore believe that the only way to correctly understand the Bible is within
the Church. Other witnesses to Holy Tradition include the Liturgy of the
Church, its iconography, the rulings of Holy Synods, especially the Ecumenical
councils, and the writings of the Church Fathers. From the consensus of the
Fathers ("consensus patrum") one may enter more deeply and understand more
fully the Church's life. Individual Fathers are not looked upon as infallible,
but rather their whole consensus will give one a proper understanding of the
Bible and Christian doctrine. Territorial expansion and doctrinal integrity.
During the course of the early church, there were numerous followers who
attached themselves to the Christ and His mission here on Earth, as well as
followers who retained the distinct duty of being commissioned with preserving
the quality of life and lessons revealed through the experience of Jesus
living, dying, resurrecting and ascending among them. As a matter of practical
distinction and logistics, people of varying gifts were accorded stations
within the community structure – ranging from the host of agape meals (shared
with brotherly and fatherly love), to prophecy and the reading of Scripture, to
preaching and interpretations and giving aid to the sick and the poor. Sometime
after Pentecost the Church grew to a point where it was no longer possible for
the Apostles to minister alone. Overseers (bishops) and assistants (deacons and
deaconesses) were appointed to further the mission of the Church. The ecclesia
recognized the gathering of these early church communities as being greatest in
areas of the known world that were famous for their significance on the world
stage – either as hotbeds of intellectual discourse, high volumes of trade,
or proximity to the original sacred sites. These locations were targeted by the
early apostles, who recognized the need for humanitarian efforts in these large
urban centers and sought to bring as many people as possible into the ecclesia
– such a life was seen as a form of deliverance from the decadent lifestyles
promoted throughout the eastern and western Roman empire. As the Church
increased in size through the centuries, the logistic dynamics of operating
such large entities shifted: patriarchs, metropolitans, archimandrites, abbots
and abbesses, all rose up to cover certain points of administration. As a
result of heightened exposure and popularity of the philosophical schools
(haereseis) of Greco-Roman society and education, Synods and Councils were
forced to engage such schools that sought to co-opt the language and pretext of
the Christian faith in order gain power and popularity for their own political
and cultural expansion. As a result, ecumenical councils were held to attempt
to rebuild solidarity by using the strength of distant orthodox witnesses to
dampen the intense local effects of particular philosophical schools within a
given area. While originally intended to serve as an internal check and balance
for the defense of faulty local doctrine against the doctrine developed and
spread by the apostles to the various sees, at times the church found its own
bishops and emperors falling prey to local conventions – at these crucial
moments in the history of the church, it found itself able to rebuild on the
basis of the faith as it was kept and maintained by monastic communities who
subsisted without reliance on the community of the state or popular culture and
were generally unaffected by the materialism and rhetoric that often dominated
and threatened the integrity and stability of the urban churches. In this
sense, the aim of the councils was never to expand or fuel a popular need for a
clearer or relevant picture of the original apostolic teaching. Rather, the
theologians spoke to address the issues of external schools of thought who
wished to distort the simplicity and neutrality of the apostolic teaching for
personal or political gain. The consistency of the Orthodox faith is entirely
dependent on the Holy Tradition of the accepted corpus of belief – the
decisions ratified by the fathers of the seven ecumenical councils, and this is
only done at the beginning of a consecutive council so that the effects of the
decisions of the prior council can be audited and verified as being both
conceptually sound and pragmatically feasible and beneficial for the church as
a whole. Theotokos and saints. The Orthodox Church believes death and the
separation of body and soul to be unnatural—a result of the Fall of Man. They
also hold that the congregation of the Church comprises both the living and the
dead. All persons currently in heaven are considered to be saints, whether
their names are known or not. There are, however, those saints of distinction
whom God has revealed as particularly good examples. When a saint is revealed
and ultimately recognized by a large portion of the Church a service of
official recognition (glorification) is celebrated. This does not 'make' the
person a saint, it merely recognizes the fact and announces it to the rest of
the Church. A day is prescribed for the saint’s celebration, hymns composed
and icons are created. Numerous saints are celebrated on each day of the year.
They are venerated (shown great respect and love) but not worshiped, for
worship is due to God alone. In showing the saints this love and requesting
their prayers, it is believed by the Orthodox that they thus assist in the
process of salvation for others. Pre-eminent among the saints is the Virgin
Mary, the Theotokos ("God-bearer"). In Orthodox theology, the Theotokos is the
fulfillment of the Old Testament archetype revealed in the Ark of the Covenant,
because she carried the New Covenant in the person of Christ; thus, the
Orthodox consider her the Ark of the New Covenant, and give her the respect and
reverence as such. The Theotokos was chosen by God and freely co-operated in
that choice to be the Mother of Jesus Christ, the God-man. The Orthodox believe
that the Christ Child from the moment of conception was both fully God and
fully Man. She is thus called 'Theotokos' as an affirmation of the divinity of
the One to whom she gave birth. It is also believed that her virginity was not
compromised in conceiving God-incarnate, that she was not harmed and that she
remained forever a virgin; scriptural references to "brothers" of Christ are
interpreted as kin, given that the word 'brother' was used in multiple ways,
just as the term "father". Due to her unique place in salvation history, Mary
is honored above all other saints and especially venerated for the great work
that God accomplished through her. The bodies and physical items connected with
saints are also regarded by the Church as holy. Many miracles have been
reported throughout history since Biblical times connected with saints' relics,
often including healing from disease and injury. Eschatology. Orthodox
Christians believe that when a person dies the soul is temporarily separated
from the body. Though it may linger for a short period on Earth, it is
ultimately escorted either to paradise (Abraham's bosom) or the darkness of
Hades, following the Temporary Judgment. Orthodox do not accept the doctrine of
Purgatory, which is held by Roman Catholicism. The soul’s experience of
either of these states is only a “foretaste”—being experienced only by
the soul—until the Final Judgment, when the soul and body will be reunited.
The Orthodox believe that the state of the soul in Hades can be affected by the
love and prayers of the righteous up until the Last Judgment. For this reason
the Church offers a special prayer for the dead on the third day, ninth day,
fortieth day, and the one-year anniversary after the death of an Orthodox
Christian. There are also several days throughout the year that are set aside
for general commemoration of the departed, sometimes including nonbelievers.
These days usually fall on a Saturday, since it was on a Saturday that Christ
lay in the Tomb. While the Orthodox consider the text of the Apocalypse (Book
of Revelation) to be a part of Scripture, it is also regarded to be a mystery.
Speculation on the contents of Revelation are minimal and it is never read as
part of the regular order of services. Those theologians who have delved into
its pages tend to be amillennialist in their eschatology, believing that the
"thousand years" spoken of in biblical prophecy refers to the present time:
from the Crucifixion of Christ until the Second Coming. While it is not usually
taught in church it is often used as a reminder of God’s promise to those who
love Him, and of the benefits of avoiding sinful passions. Iconographic
depictions of the Final Judgment are often portrayed on the back (western) wall
of the church building to remind the departing faithful to be vigilant in their
struggle against sin. Likewise it is often painted on the walls of the Trapeza
(refectory) in a monastery where monks may be inspired to sobriety and
detachment from worldly things while they eat. The Orthodox believe that Hell,
though often described in metaphor as punishment inflicted by God, is in
reality the soul's rejection of God's infinite love which is offered freely and
abundantly to everyone. Traditions. Art and architecture. Church buildings. The
church building has many symbolic meanings; perhaps the oldest and most
prominent is the concept that the Church is the Ark (as in Noah's) in which the
world is saved from the flood of temptations; therefore, most Orthodox Churches
are rectangular in design. Another popular configuration, especially for
churches with large choirs is cruciform or cross-shaped. Architectural patterns
vary in shape and complexity, with chapels sometimes added around the main
church, or triple altars; but in general, the symbolic layout of the church
remains the same. Each church is created with specified qualifications based on
what the apostles said in the Bible. These qualifications include how big the
temple should be. The Church building is divided into three main parts: the
narthex (vestibule), the nave and the sanctuary (also called the "altar" or
"holy place"). The narthex is where catechumens and non-Orthodox visitors were
traditionally asked to stand during services. It is separated from the nave by
“The Royal Gate”. On each side of this gate are candle stands (menalia)
representing the pillars of fire that went before the Hebrew people escaping
from Egypt. The nave is where most of the congregation stand during services.
Traditionally, men stand on the right and women on the left. This is for a
number of reasons: (1) Considering the family unit of past centuries the
husband was dominant; thus, standing the same distance from the altar, equality
is emphasised. (2) The idea of separating the sexes was inherited from the
Jewish tradition of doing so within synagogues (3) Separation of sexes also
followed the practice of choirs in which different levels of voice are placed
in groups to facilitate harmony. In general, men and women dress respectfully,
typically wearing their "Sunday best" to enter the church. Often, women cover
their heads as prescribed by Paul (1 Cor. 11:13). Children are considered full
members of the Church and stand attentive and quiet during services. There is
often a choir area at the side or in a loft in back. In addition to the Choir,
a Chanter is always present at the front of the church to chant responses and
hymns that are part of the Divine Liturgy offered by the Priest. There is
usually a dome in the ceiling with an icon of Christ depicted as Ruler of the
Universe (Pantocrator). Everything in the Orthodox Church has a purpose and a
meaning revealing God's revelation to man. At the front, or Eastern end of the
church, is a raised dais with an icon-covered screen or wall (iconostasis or
templon) separating the nave from the sanctuary. In the center of this wall is
the entrance to the altar known as the “Royal Doors” through which only the
clergy may pass. There are also a right and left side door on the front of the
iconostasis, one depicting the archangel, Michael and the other Gabriel. The
priest and altar boys enter and exit through these doors during appropriate
parts of the Divine Liturgy. Immediately to the right of the main gate you will
always find icon of Jesus Christ. Other icons depicted on the iconostatis are
the Mother of God, John the Baptist and the Saint after which the church is
named. In front of the iconostasis is the bishop's chair, where a visiting
bishop or metropolitan will often sit as a place of honor when visiting the
church. An Orthodox priest, when standing at the altar during the Divine
Liturgy, faces toward the altar (typically facing east) and properly leads his
congregation while together they perform the mystical sacrifice and pray to
God. The sanctuary contains the Holy Altar, representing the place where
Orthodox Christians believe that Christ was born of the virgin Mary, crucified
under Pontius Pilate, laid in the tomb, descended into hell, rose from the dead
on the third day, ascended into heaven, and will return again at his second
coming. A free-standing cross, bearing the body of Christ, may stand behind the
altar. On the altar are a cloth covering, a large book containing the gospel
readings performed during services, an ark containing presanctified divine
gifts (bread and wine) distributed by the deacon or priest to those who cannot
come to the church to receive them, and several white beeswax candles. Icons.
The term 'icon' comes from the Greek word "eikona", which simply means image.
The Orthodox believe that the first icons of Christ and the Virgin Mary were
painted by Luke the Evangelist. Icons are filled with symbolism designed to
convey information about the person or event depicted. For this reason, icons
tend to be formulaic, following a prescribed methodology for how a particular
person should be depicted, including hair style, body position, clothing, and
background details. Icon painting, in general, is not an opportunity for
artistic expression, though each iconographer brings a vision to the piece. It
is far more common for an icon to be copied from an older model, though with
the recognition of a new saint in the church, a new icon must be created and
approved. The personal and creative traditions of Western European religious
art were largely lacking in Orthodox iconography before the 17th century, when
Russian iconography began to be strongly influenced by religious paintings and
engravings from both Protestant and Roman Catholic Europe. Greek iconography
also began to take on a strong western influence for a period and the
difference between some Orthodox icons and western religious art began to
vanish. More recently there has been a trend of returning to the more
traditional and symbolic representations. The style of the icons seems to have
been borrowed heavily from the paganism of the Greek culture. Henry Chadwick
writes, “In this instinct there was a measure of truth. The representations
of Christ as the Almighty Lord on his judgment throne owed something to
pictures of Zeus. Portraits of the Mother of God were not wholly independent of
a pagan past of venerated mother-goddesses. In the popular mind the saints had
come to fill a role that had been played by heroes and deities.” Free-
standing statues (three dimensional depictions) are almost non-existent within
the Orthodox Church. This is partly due to the rejection of the previous pagan
Greek age of idol worship and partly because icons are meant to show the
spiritual nature of man, not the sensual earthly body. Bas reliefs, however,
became common during the Byzantine period and led to a tradition of covering a
painted icon in a silver or gold 'riza' in order to preserve the icon. Such bas
relief coverings usually leave the faces and hands of the saints exposed for
veneration. Icons are not considered by the Orthodox to be idols or objects of
worship. The parameters of their usage were clearly spelled out by the 7th
ecumenical council. Justification for their usage utilises the following logic:
before God took human form in Christ, no material depiction was possible and
therefore blasphemous even to contemplate. Once God became incarnate, depiction
was possible. As Christ believed to be God, it is justified to hold in one's
mind the image of God-incarnate. Likewise, when one venerates an icon, it is
not the wood or paint that are venerated but rather the individual shown, just
as it is not the paper one loves when one might kiss the photograph of a loved
one. As Saint Basil famously proclaimed, honour or veneration of the icon
always passes to its archetype. Following this reasoning, the veneration of the
glorified human saint made in God's image, is always a veneration of the divine
image, and hence God as foundational archetype. Icons can be found adorning the
walls of churches and often cover the inside structure completely. Most
Orthodox homes have an area set aside for family prayer, usually an eastern
facing wall, where are hung many icons. Icons have been part of Orthodox
Christianity since the beginning of the church. Icons are often illuminated by
a candle or oil lamp. (Beeswax for candles and olive oil for lamps are
preferred because they are natural and burn cleanly.) Besides the practical
purpose of making icons visible in an otherwise dark church, both candles and
oil lamps symbolise the Light of the World, who is Christ. Tales of miraculous
icons are not uncommon, though it has always been considered that the message
of such an event was for the immediate faithful involved and therefore does not
usually attract crowds. Some miraculous icons whose reputations span long
periods of time nevertheless become objects of pilgrimage along with the places
where they are kept. As several Orthodox theologians and saints have explored
in the past, the icon's miraculous nature is found not in the material, but in
the glory of the saint who is depicted. The icon is a window, in the words of
Paul Florensky, that actually participates in the glory of what it represents.
See also icons. Iconostasis. An "iconostasis", also called the "templon", is a
wall of icons and religious paintings, separating the nave from the sanctuary
in a church. "Iconostasis" also refers to a portable icon stand that can be
placed anywhere within a church. The modern iconostasis evolved from the
Byzantine templon in the 11th century. The evolution of the iconostasis
probably owes a great deal to 14th-century Hesychast mysticism and the wood-
carving genius of the Russian Orthodox Church. The first ceiling-high, five-
leveled Russian iconostasis was designed by Andrey Rublyov in the cathedral of
the Dormition in Vladimir in 1408. The separation between sanctuary and nave
accomplished by the iconostasis is not mandatory, albeit it is common practice.
Depending on circumstance, the role of the iconostasis can be played by
masonry, carved panels, screens, curtains, railings, a cord or rope, plain
icons on stands, steps, or nothing at all. Cross. Depictions of the Cross
within the Orthodox Church are numerous and often highly ornamented, but its
use does not extend to all Orthodox traditions. Some carry special
significance. The Tri-Bar Cross, popular in Russia and Ukraine, but common
throughout the Orthodox world, seen to the right, has three bars. Its origins
are in the early Byzantine Church of the 4th century AD. The small top crossbar
represents the sign that Pontius Pilate nailed above Christ's head. It often is
inscribed with an acronym, "INRI", Latin, meaning “Jesus of Nazareth, King of
the Jews” or "INBI", Ancient Greek, "Jesus; of Nazareth, King of the Jews”;
however, it is often replaced or amplified by the phrase "The King of Glory" in
order to answer Pilate's statement with Christ's affirmation, "My Kingdom is
not of this world." There is also a bottom slanting bar. This appears for a
number of reasons. Claims of evidence indicate that there was a small wooden
platform for the crucified to stand on in order to support his weight; in
Jesus' case his feet were nailed side by side to this platform with one nail
each in order to prolong the torture of the cross. Implied evidence for this
comes mainly from two sources within Holy Tradition, the Bible (in order to
cause the victim to die faster their legs were broken so they could not support
their weight and would suffocate) and iconography (all early depictions of the
crucifixion show this arrangement, not the later with feet on top with single
nail). It has also been pointed out by some experts that the nailed hands of a
body crucified in the manner often shown in modern secular art would not
support the weight of the body and would tear through. A platform for the feet
would relieve this problem. The bottom bar is slanted for two reasons, to
represent the very real agony which Christ experienced on the cross (a
refutation of Docetism) and to signify that the thief on Christ's right chose
the right path while the thief on the left did not. Other crosses associated
with the Orthodox Church are the more traditional single-bar crosses, budded
designs, the Jerusalem cross (cross pattée), Celtic crosses, and others.
Services. The services of the church are properly conducted each day following
a rigid, but constantly changing annual schedule (i.e., parts of the service
remain the same while others change depending on the day of the year). Services
are conducted in the church and involve both the clergy and faithful. Services
cannot properly be conducted by a single person, but must have at least one
other person present (i.e. a Priest cannot celebrate alone, but must have at
least a Chanter present and participating). Usually, all of the services are
conducted on a daily basis only in monasteries and cathedrals, while parish
churches might only do the services on the weekend and major feast days. On
certain Great Feasts (and, according to some traditions, every Sunday) a
special All-Night Vigil ("Agrypnia") will be celebrated from late at night on
the eve of the feast until early the next morning. Because of its festal nature
it is usually followed by a breakfast feast shared together by the
congregation. The Divine Liturgy is the celebration of the Eucharist. Although
it is usually celebrated between the Sixth and Ninth Hours, it is not
considered to be part of the daily cycle of services, as it occurs outside the
normal time of the world. The Divine Liturgy is not celebrated on weekdays
during the preparatory season of Great Lent and in some places during the
lesser fasting seasons either. Reserve communion is prepared on Sundays and is
distributed during the week at the Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts. Other
items brought to the altar during the Divine Liturgy include a gold or silver
chalice with red wine, a small metallic urn of warm water, a metallic communion
spoon, a little metallic spear, a sponge, a metal disk with cut pieces of bread
upon it, and a star, which is a star-shaped piece of metal over which the
priest places a cloth covering when transporting the holy gifts to and from the
altar. Also found on the altar table is the antimins. The antimins is a silk
cloth, signed by the appropriate diocesan bishop, upon which the sanctification
of the holy gifts takes place during each Divine Liturgy. The antimins contain
the relics of a saint. When a church is consecrated by a bishop, there is a
formal service or prayers and sanctification in the name of the Saint that the
church is named after. The bishop will also often present a small relic of a
saint to place in or on the altar as part of the consecration of a new church.
An orthodox priest (or bishop) may celebrate only one Divine Liturgy per day.
The Divine Liturgy may only be celebrated once a day on any particular antimins
and altar. This means that most parishes or congregations, unless they have
more than one officially-signed antimins and multiple priests, can celebrate
only one Eucharist per day, in order to express the catholicity of the church
by avoiding "private masses". The book containing liturgically read portions of
the four gospels is permanently "enthroned" on the altar table. The Orthodox
bishops, priests, deacons and readers sing/chant specific verses from this
Gospel Book on each different day of the year. This daily cycle services are
conceived of as both the sanctification of time ("chronos", the specific times
during which they are celebrated), and entry into eternity ("kairos"). They
consist to a large degree of litanies asking for God's mercy on the living and
the dead, readings from the Psalter with introductory prayers, troparia, and
other prayers and hymns surrounding them. The Psalms are so arranged that when
all the services are celebrated the entire Psalter is read through in their
course once a week, and twice a week during Great Lent when the services are
celebrated in an extended form. Chanting. Orthodox services are sung nearly in
their entirety. Services consist in part of a dialogue between the clergy and
the people (often represented by the choir or the Psaltis Cantor). In each case
the prayers are sung or chanted following a prescribed musical form. Almost
nothing is read in a normal speaking voice, with the exception of the homily if
one is given. Because the human voice is seen as the most perfect instrument of
praise, musical instruments (organs, guitars, etc.) are not generally used to
accompany the choir. The church has developed eight Modes or Tones (see
Octoechos) within which a chant may be set, depending on the time of year,
feast days, or other considerations of the Typikon. There are numerous versions
and styles that are traditional and acceptable and these vary a great deal
between cultures. It is common, especially in the United States, for a choir to
learn many different styles and to mix them, singing one response in Greek,
then English, then Russian, etc. It should also be noted that in the Russian
tradition there have been some very famous composers of Church music such as
Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff; and many Church tones can likewise be seen
influencing their music. Incense. As part of the legacy handed down from its
Judaic roots, incense is used during all services in the Orthodox Church as an
offering of worship to God as it was done in the Jewish First and Second
Temples in Jerusalem (Exodus chapter 30). Incense is also prophesied in the
book of ( as a "pure offering" in the glorification of God by the Gentiles in
"every place" where the name of God is regarded as "great". Traditionally, the
base of the incense used is the resin of Boswellia thurifera, also known as
frankincense, but the resin of fir trees has been used as well. It is usually
mixed with various floral essential oils giving it a sweet smell. Incense
represents the sweetness of the prayers of the saints rising up to God (, , ).
The incense is burned in an ornate golden censer that hangs at the end of three
chains representing the Trinity. Two chains represent the human and Godly
nature of the Son, one chain for the Father and one chain for the Holy Spirit.
The lower cup represents the earth and the upper cup the heaven. In the Greek
and Syrian traditions there are 12 bells hung along these chains representing
the 12 apostles (usually no bells in Slavic tradition). There are also 72 links
representing 72 evangelists. The charcoal represents the sinners. Fire
signifies the Holy Spirit and frankincense the good deeds. The incense also
represents the grace of the Holy Trinity. The censer is used (swung back and
forth) by the priest/deacon to venerate all four sides of the altar, the holy
gifts, the clergy, the icons, the congregation, and the church structure
itself. Fasting. The number of fast days varies from year to year, but in
general the Orthodox Christian can expect to spend a little over half the year
fasting at some level of strictness. There are spiritual, symbolic, and even
practical reasons for fasting. In the Fall from Paradise mankind became
possessed by a carnal nature; that is to say, he became inclined towards the
passions. Through fasting, Orthodox Christians attempt to return to the
relationship of love and obedience to God enjoyed by Adam and Eve in Paradise
in their own lives, by refraining from carnal practices, by bridling the tongue
(), confession of sins, prayer and almsgiving. Fasting is seen as purification
and the regaining of innocence. Through obedience to the Church and its ascetic
practices the Orthodox Christian seeks to rid himself or herself of the
"passions" (The desires of our fallen carnal nature). All Orthodox Christians
are expected to fast following a prescribed set of guidelines. They do not view
fasting as a hardship, but rather as a privilege and joy. The teaching of the
Church fixes both the times and the amount of fasting that is expected as a
minimum for every member. For greater ascesis, some may choose to go without
food entirely for a short period of time. A complete three-day fast at the
beginning and end of a fasting period is not unusual, and some fast for even
longer periods, though this is usually practiced only in monasteries. In
general, fasting means abstaining from meat and meat products, dairy (eggs and
cheese) and dairy products, fish, olive oil, and wine. Wine and oil—and, less
frequently, fish—are allowed on certain feast days when they happen to fall
on a day of fasting; but animal products and dairy are forbidden on fast days,
with the exception of "Cheese Fare" week which precedes Great Lent, during
which dairy products are allowed. Wine and oil are usually also allowed on
Saturdays and Sundays during periods of fast. In some Orthodox traditions,
caviar is permitted on Lazarus Saturday, the Saturday before Palm Sunday,
although the day is otherwise a fast day. Married couples also abstain from
sexual relations on fast days, that they may devote themselves to prayer ().
While it may seem that fasting in the manner set forth by the Church is a
strict rule, there are circumstances where a person's spiritual guide may allow
an Economy because of some physical necessity (e.g. those who are pregnant or
infirm, the very young and the elderly, or those who have no control over their
diet, such as prisoners or soldiers). In addition to these fasting seasons,
Orthodox Christians fast on every Wednesday (in commemoration of Christ's
betrayal by Judas Iscariot), and Friday (in commemoration of Christ's
Crucifixion) throughout the year. Monastics often fast on Mondays (in imitation
of the Angels, who are commemorated on that day in the weekly cycle, since
monastics are striving to lead an angelic life on earth, and angels neither eat
nor drink). Orthodox Christians who are preparing to receive the Eucharist do
not eat or drink at all from vespers (sunset) until after taking Holy
Communion. A similar total fast is expected to be kept on the Eve of Nativity,
the Eve of Theophany (Epiphany), Great Friday and Holy Saturday for those who
can do so. There are other individual days observed as fasts (though not as
days of total fasting) no matter what day of the week they fall on, such as the
Beheading of St. John the Baptist on August 29 and the Exaltation of the Holy
Cross on September 14. Strict fasting is canonically forbidden on Saturdays and
Sundays due to the festal character of the Sabbath and the Resurrection,
respectively. On those days wine and oil are permitted even if abstention from
them would be otherwise called for. Holy Saturday is the only Saturday of the
year where a strict fast is kept. When certain feast days fall on fast days,
the fasting laws are lessened to a certain extent, to allow some consolation in
the "trapeza" (refectory) for the longer services, and to provide an element of
sober celebration to accompany the spiritual joy of the feast. It is considered
a greater sin to advertise one's fasting than not to participate in the fast.
Fasting is a purely personal communication between the Orthodox Christian and
God. If one has health concerns, or responsibilities that cannot be fulfilled
because of fasting, then it is perfectly permissible not to fast. An
individual's observance of the fasting laws is not to be judged by the
community (), but is a private matter between him and his Spiritual Father or
Confessor. Almsgiving. "Almsgiving" refers to any charitable giving of material
resources to those in need. Along with "prayer" and "fasting", it is considered
a pillar of the personal spiritual practices of the Orthodox Christian
tradition. Almsgiving is particularly important during periods of fasting, when
the Orthodox believer is expected to share the monetary savings from his or her
decreased consumption with those in need. As with fasting, bragging about the
amounts given for charity is considered anywhere from extremely rude to sinful.
Monasticism. All Orthodox Christians are expected to participate in at least
some ascetic works, in response to the commandment of Christ to "come, take up
the cross, and follow me." (Mark 10:21 and elsewhere) They are therefore all
called to imitate, in one way or another, Christ himself who denied himself to
the extent of literally taking up the cross on the way to his voluntary self-
sacrifice. However, laypeople are not expected to live in extreme asceticism
since this is close to impossible while undertaking the normal responsibilities
of worldly life. Those who wish to do this therefore separate themselves from
the world and live as monastics: monks and nuns. As ascetics "par excellence",
using the allegorical weapons of prayer and fasting in spiritual warfare
against their passions, monastics hold a very special and important place in
the Church. This kind of life is often seen as incompatible with any kind of
worldly activity including that which is normally regarded as virtuous. Social
work, school teaching, and other such work is therefore usually left to
laypeople. Ascetics of Orthodox Church are recognized by their long hair, and
in case of male monks long beards. There are three main types of monastics.
Those who live in monasteries under a common rule are "coenobitic". Each
monastery may formulate its own rule, and although there are no religious
orders in Orthodoxy some respected monastic centers such as Mount Athos are
highly influential. "Eremitic" monks, or hermits, are those who live solitary
lives. It is the yearning of many who enter the monastic life to eventually
become solitary hermits. This most austere life is only granted to the most
advanced monastics and only when their superiors feel they are ready for it.
Hermits are usually associated with a larger monastery but live in seclusion
some distance from the main compound. Their local monastery will see to their
physical needs, supplying them with simple foods while disturbing them as
little as possible. In between are those in "semi-eremitic" communities, or
"sketes", where one or two monks share each of a group of nearby dwellings
under their own rules and only gather together in the central chapel, or
"katholikon", for liturgical observances. The spiritual insight gained from
their ascetic struggles make monastics preferred for missionary activity.
Bishops are almost always chosen from among monks, and those who are not
generally receive the monastic tonsure before their consecrations. Many (but
not all) Orthodox seminaries are attached to monasteries, combining academic
preparation for ordination with participation in the community's life of
prayer. Monks who have been ordained to the priesthood are called "hieromonk"
(priest-monk); monks who have been ordained to the diaconate are called
"hierodeacon" (deacon-monk). Not all monks live in monasteries, some hieromonks
serve as priests in parish churches thus practicing "monasticism in the world".
Cultural practices differ slightly, but in general "Father" is the correct form
of address for monks who have been tonsured, while Novices are addressed as
"Brother". Similarly, "Mother" is the correct form of address for nuns who have
been tonsured, while Novices are addressed as "Sister". Nuns live identical
ascetic lives to their male counterparts and are therefore also called
"monachoi" (monastics) or the feminine plural form in Greek, "monachai", and
their common living space is called a monastery. The Holy Mysteries
(Sacraments). According to Orthodox theology, the purpose of the Christian life
is to attain theosis, the mystical union of man with God. This union is
understood as both collective and individual. St. Athanasius of Alexandria,
wrote concerning the Incarnation that, "He (Jesus) was made man that we might
be made god (θεοποιηθῶμεν)". See , , . The entire life of the
church is oriented towards making this possible and facilitating it. In the
Orthodox Church the terms “Mystery” or “The Mysteries” refer to the
process of theosis. While it is understood that God theoretically can do
anything instantly and invisibly, it is also understood that he generally
chooses to use material substance as a medium in order to reach people. The
limitations are those of mankind, not God. Matter is not considered to be evil
by the Orthodox. Water, oil, bread, wine, etc., all are means by which God
reaches out to allow people to draw closer to him. How this process works is a
“Mystery”, and cannot be defined in human terms. These Mysteries are
surrounded by prayer and symbolism so that their true meaning will not be
forgotten. Those things which in the West are often termed Sacraments or
sacramentals are known among the Orthodox as the Sacred Mysteries. While the
Roman Catholic Church numbers seven Sacraments, and many Protestant groups list
two (Baptism and the Eucharist) or even none, the Orthodox do not limit the
number. However, for the sake of convenience, catechisms will often speak of
the seven Great Mysteries. Among these are Holy Communion (the most direct
connection), Baptism, Chrismation, Confession, Unction, Matrimony, and
Ordination. But the term also properly applies to other sacred actions such as
monastic Tonsure or the blessing of holy water, and involves fasting,
almsgiving, or an act as simple as lighting a candle, burning incense, praying
or asking God's blessing on food. Baptism. Baptism is the mystery which
transforms the old, sinful man into the new, pure man; the old life, the sins,
any mistakes made are gone and a clean slate is given. Through baptism one is
united to the Body of Christ by becoming a member of the Orthodox Church.
During the service water is blessed. The catechumen is fully immersed in the
water three times in the name of the Holy Trinity. This is considered to be a
death of the "old man" by participation in the crucifixion and burial of
Christ, and a rebirth into new life in Christ by participation in his
resurrection. Properly a new name is given, which becomes the person's name.
Children of Orthodox families are normally baptized shortly after birth.
Converts to Orthodoxy are usually formally baptized into the Orthodox Church
though exceptions are sometimes made. Those who have left Orthodoxy and adopted
a new religion, if they return to their Orthodox roots, are usually received
back into the church through the mystery of Chrismation. Properly, the mystery
of baptism is administered by bishops and priests; however, in emergencies any
Orthodox Christian can baptize. In such cases, should the person survive the
emergency, it is likely that the person will be properly baptized by a priest
at some later date. This is not considered to be a second baptism, nor is it
imagined that the person is not already Orthodox, but rather it is a
fulfillment of the proper form. The service of baptism used in Orthodox
churches has remained largely unchanged for over 1500 years. This fact is
witnessed to by St. Cyril of Jerusalem (d. 386), who, in his Discourse on the
Sacrament of Baptism, describes the service in much the same way as is
currently in use. Chrismation. Chrismation (sometimes called confirmation) is
the mystery by which a baptized person is granted the gift of the Holy Spirit
through anointing with Holy Chrism. It is normally given immediately after
baptism as part of the same service, but is also used to receive lapsed members
of the Orthodox Church. As baptism is a person's participation in the death and
resurrection of Christ, so Chrismation is a person's participation in the
coming of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost. A baptized and chrismated Orthodox
Christian is a full member of the Church, and may receive the Eucharist
regardless of age. The creation of Chrism may be accomplished by any bishop at
any time, but usually is done only once a year, often when a synod of bishops
convenes for its annual meeting. (Some autocephalous churches get their chrism
from others.) Anointing with it substitutes for the laying-on of hands
described in the New Testament, even when an instrument such as a brush is
used. Holy Communion. The Eucharist is at the center of Orthodox Christianity.
In practice, it is the partaking of the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ in the
midst of the Divine Liturgy with the rest of the church. The bread and wine are
believed to become the genuine Body and Blood of the Christ Jesus through the
operation of the Holy Spirit. The Orthodox Church has never described exactly
how this occurs, or gone into the detail that the Roman Catholic Church has in
the West. Communion is given only to baptized and chrismated Orthodox
Christians who have prepared by fasting, prayer and confession. The priest will
administer the Gifts with a spoon, called a "cochlear", directly into the
recipient's mouth from the chalice. From baptism young infants and children are
carried to the chalice to receive Holy Communion. Because of the Orthodox
understanding of man’s fallen nature in general those who wish to commune
prepare themselves in a way that reflects man in paradise. First, the
individual prepares by having his confession heard and the prayer of repentance
read over him by a priest. The person will increase their prayer rule adding
the prescribed prayers in preparation for communing. Finally, the person will
fast completely from food and drink from the evening of the previous day
(usually sunset on Saturday if communing on Sunday). Repentance. Orthodox
Christians who have committed sins but repent of them, and who wish to
reconcile themselves to God and renew the purity of their original baptisms,
confess their sins to God before a spiritual guide who offers advice and
direction to assist the individual in overcoming their sin. Parish priests
commonly function as spiritual guides, but such guides can be any person, male
or female, who has been given a blessing to hear confessions. Spiritual guides
are chosen very carefully as it is a mandate that once chosen, they must be
obeyed. Having confessed, the penitent then has his or her parish priest read
the prayer of repentance over them. Sin is not viewed by the Orthodox as a
stain on the soul that needs to be wiped out, or a legal transgression that
must be set right by a punitive sentence, but rather as a mistake made by the
individual with the opportunity for spiritual growth and development. An act of
Penance ("epitemia"), if the spiritual guide requires it, is never formulaic,
but rather is directed toward the individual and their particular problem, as a
means of establishing a deeper understanding of the mistake made, and how to
effect its cure. Because full participatory membership is granted to infants,
it is not unusual for even small children to confess; though the scope of their
culpability is far less than an older child, still their opportunity for
spiritual growth remains the same. Marriage. From the Eastern Orthodox
perspective, marriage is one of the holy mysteries or sacraments. As well as in
many other Christian traditions, for example in the Catholic Church, it serves
to unite a woman and a man in eternal union and love before God, with the
purpose of following Christ and His Gospel and raising up a faithful, holy
family through their holy union. It is referred to extensively in both the Old
and New Testaments. Christ declared the essential indissolubility of marriage
in the Gospel. Both virginity and marriage have the same reference to the
future Kingdom. Jesus said that "when they rise from the dead, they neither
marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven" (Mk 12:25). For
Orthodox Christian this passage should not be understood to imply that
Christian marriage will not remain a reality in the Kingdom, but points to the
fact that relations will not be "fleshy", but "spiritual". Love between wife
and husband, as an icon of relationship between Christ and Church, is eternal.
The Church does recognize that there are rare occasions when it is better that
couples do separate, but there is no official recognition of civil divorces.
For the Orthodox, the marriage is indissoluble as in it should not be broken,
the violation of such a union, perceived as holy, being an offense resulted
from either adultery or the prolonged absence of one of the partners. Thus,
permitting remarriage is an act of compassion of the Church towards sinful man.
In the U.S., according to 2001 statistics, 14% of Orthodox marriages ended in
an ecclesiastical divorce; a figure that, since it took no account of how many
of the couples who entered such marriages took out a civil divorce, is not
comparable with the figure of 43% given at that time for the proportion of all
marriages that ended in a civil divorce, but which has been argued as
indicating a probable total of only 15% of marriages celebrated in an Orthodox
church led to any form of divorce. Divorced individuals are usually allowed to
remarry though there is usually imposed on them a fairly severe penance by
their bishop and the services for a second marriage in this case are more
penitential than joyful. Widows are permitted to remarry without repercussion
and their second marriage is considered just as valid as the first. One
exception to this rule is the clergy and their wives. Should a married priest
die, it is expected that his wife will retire to a monastery as soon as their
children are out of the house. Widowed priests are not allowed to remarry and
also frequently end up in monasteries. The service of Marriage in the Orthodox
Church has two distinct parts: The Betrothal and The Crowning. 1. The exchange
of the rings, (It has always been the tradition of the Church to place the
wedding ring on the right hand of the couple based on biblical references. This
is seen very clearly in one of the prayers in the Betrothal Service. A portion
of the prayer refers to the biblical references: “For You, O Lord, have
declared that a pledge is to be given and held inviolate in all things. By a
ring Joseph was given might in Egypt; by a ring Daniel was exalted in Babylon;
by a ring our heavenly Father showed compassion upon His prodigal son, for He
said, ‘Put a ring upon his right hand, kill the fatted calf, and let us eat
and rejoice.’ Your own right hand, O Lord, armed Moses in the Red Sea. By
word of Your truth were the Heavens established and the earth set upon her sure
foundations; and the right hands of Your servants shall be blessed by Your
mighty word, and by Your uplifted arm.” As we see, it was scripturally the
practice to wear rings on the right hand, the hand of authority and power
completing the pledge of commitment. The power and authority comes from the
right hand of God.) 2. The procession, the declaration of intent, and 3. The
lighting of candles. The Crowning includes: The readings from the epistle and
gospel, the Blessing of the Common Cup, and the Dance of Isaiah (the bride and
groom are led around the table 3 times), and then the Removal of the Crowns.
There is no exchange of vows. There is a set expectation of the obligations
incumbent on a married couple, and whatever promises they may have privately to
each other are their responsibility to keep. The ceremony ends with the reading
of Benedictions to and the Greeting of the Couple. At the Sacrament of Marriage
the crowns are placed on the bride and groom’s heads as the following prayer
is recited three times, “The servant of God, (groom’s name), is crowned to
the handmaid of God, (bride’s name), in the Name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Spirit” three times. It is then repeated three times as
the bride is crowned to the groom. We witness the groom and bride being crowned
(visibly proclaimed) as the king and queen, respectively, of a new family,
entrusted by God with the authority to rule their family in faith and love and
harmony with Christ. They both share in this responsibility and privilege as a
newly married couple. This is not simply being declared by the priest or even
the Church, but by God Himself, as the following hymn is chanted three times:
“O Lord, our God, crown them with glory and honor.” The crowns are then
switched back and forth between the groom and bride’s head, signifying that
they completely share their lives together. The crowns also serve as a reminder
of the crowns that await them in heaven, if they live their lives in
faithfulness to God and to each other. Fr. John Meyendorff in his book,
Marriage: An Orthodox Perspective, writes: “According to St. John Chrysostom,
the crowns symbolized victory over the ‘passions’.” In the service of a
second marriage the crowns are not to be used, but if it is a second marriage
for only one of the two who are marrying and a first marriage for the other,
the usual rite is followed. Many couples keep the wedding crowns in a case and
display them near their icon corner or in the couple’s bedroom. They serve as
a reminder that God has united them to each other and to himself and that he
has bestowed his grace upon them to live in unity, faith and love. The church
understands marriage only as the union of one man and one woman, and certain
Orthodox leaders have spoken out strongly in opposition to the civil
institution of Same-Sex Marriage. Holy Orders. Since its founding, the Church
spread to different places and its leaders in each region came to be known as
"episkopoi" (overseers, plural of "episkopos", overseer—Gr. ), which became
"bishop" in English. The other ordained roles are "presbyter" (Gr. , elder),
which became "prester" and then "priest" in English, and "diakonos" (Gr. ,
servant), which became "deacon" in English (see also subdeacon). There are
numerous administrative positions among the clergy that carry additional
titles. In the Greek tradition, bishops who occupy an ancient see are called
metropolitans, while the lead bishop in Greece is the archbishop. (In the
Russian tradition, however, the usage of the terms "metropolitan" and
"archbishop" is reversed.) Priests can be archpriests, archimandrites or
protopresbyters. Deacons can also be archdeacons or protodeacons. The position
of deacon is often occupied for life. The deacon also acts as an assistant to a
bishop. With the exception of bishops, who remain celibate, the Orthodox Church
has always allowed priests and deacons to be married, provided the marriage
takes place before ordination. In general it is considered preferable for
parish priests to be married as they often act as counsel to married couples
and thus can draw on their own experience. Unmarried priests usually are monks
and live in monasteries, though there are occasions when, because of a lack of
married priests, a monk-priest is temporarily assigned to a parish. Widowed
priests and deacons may not remarry and it is common for such members of the
clergy to retire to a monastery (see clerical celibacy). This is also true of
widowed wives of clergy, who do not remarry and become nuns when their children
are grown. There is serious discussion about reviving the order of deaconess,
which fell into disuse in the first millennium; the deaconesses had both
liturgical and pastoral functions within the church. However, it has fallen out
of practice (the last deaconess was ordained in the 19th century). Unction.
Anointing with oil, often called "unction", is one of the mysteries
administered by the Orthodox Church and it is not reserved only for the dying
or terminally ill, but for all in need of spiritual or bodily healing. In
Greece, during the Ottoman occupation, it became the custom to administer this
mystery annually on Great Wednesday to all believers; in recent decades, this
custom has spread to many other locations. It is often distributed on major
feast days, or any time the clergy feel it necessary for the spiritual welfare
of its congregation. Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of
the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of
the Lord. And the prayer of faith will save the sick, and the Lord will raise
him up. And if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven.— History. Early
Church. Christianity spread rapidly throughout the Roman Empire. Paul and the
Apostles traveled extensively throughout the Empire, including Asia Minor,
establishing Churches in major communities, with the first Churches appearing
in Jerusalem and the Holy Land, then in Antioch, Ethiopia, Egypt, Rome,
Alexandria, Athens, Thessalonica, Illyricum, and Byzantium, which centuries
later would become prominent as the New Rome. Christianity in the Roman Empire
was met with some resistance as its adherents would refuse to comply with the
Roman state (even at the threat of death) in offering sacrifice to the pagan
gods. Despite being under persecution, the Church spread. The persecution
dissipated upon the conversion of Emperor Constantine I in 324 AD. By the 4th
century Christianity had spread in numerous countries. A number of influential
schools of thought had arisen, particularly the Alexandrian and Antiochian
philosophical approaches. Other groups, such as the Arians, had also managed to
gain influence however their positions caused theological conflicts within the
Church, thus prompting The Emperor Constantine to call for a great ecumenical
synod in order to define the Church's position against the growing, often
widely diverging, philosophical and theological interpretations of
Christianity. He made it possible for this council to meet not only by
providing a location, but by offering to pay for the transportation of all the
existing bishops of the Church. This synod is commonly referred to as the First
Council of Nicaea or more generally as First Ecumenical Council and is
considered of major importance by most modern Christian Churches. Ecumenical
councils. Several doctrinal disputes from the 4th century onwards led to the
calling of Ecumenical councils. 8. The Fourth Council of Constantinople was
called in 879. It restored St. Photius to his See in Constantinople and
condemned any alteration of the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed of 381. 9. The
Fifth Council of Constantinople was actually a series of councils held between
1341 and 1351. It affirmed the hesychastic theology of St. Gregory Palamas and
condemned the philosopher Barlaam of Calabria. In addition to these councils
there have been a number of significant councils meant to further define the
Orthodox position. They are the Synods of Constantinople, 1484, 1583, 1755,
1819, and 1872, the Synod of Iaşi (Jassy), 1642, and the Pan-Orthodox Synod of
Jerusalem in 1672. Roman and Byzantine Empires. Eastern Christian culture
reached its golden age during the high point of the Byzantine Empire and
continued to flourish in Ukraine and Russia, after the fall of Constantinople.
Numerous autocephalous churches were established in Eastern Europe and Slavic
areas. In the 530s the Church of the Holy Wisdom (Hagia Sophia) was built in
Constantinople under emperor Justinian I. Early schisms. The Church in Egypt
(Patriarchate of Alexandria) split into two groups following the Council of
Chalcedon (451), over a dispute about the relation between the divine and human
natures of Jesus. Eventually this led to each group anathematizing the other.
Those that remained in communion with the other patriarchs (those who accepted
the Council of Chalcedon) were called "Melkites" (the king's men, because
Constantinople was the city of the emperors), not to be confused with the
Melkite Catholics of Antioch. Those who disagreed with the findings of the
Council of Chalcedon are today known as the Coptic Orthodox Church of
Alexandria. There was a similar split in Syria (Patriarchate of Antioch)
resulting in the Syriac Orthodox Church. Those who disagreed with the Council
of Chalcedon are sometimes called "Oriental Orthodox" to distinguish them from
the Orthodox, who accepted the Council of Chalcedon. Oriental Orthodox are also
sometimes referred to as "non-Chalcedonians", or "anti-Chalcedonians". The
Oriental Orthodox Church denies that it is monophysite and prefers the term
"miaphysite", to denote the "joined" nature of Jesus (two natures joined into
one). Both the Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox churches formally believe
themselves to be the continuation of the true church, although over the last
several decades there has been some reconciliation. As well, there are the
"Nestorian" churches, which are Eastern Christian churches that keep the faith
of only the first two ecumenical councils, i.e., the First Council of Nicaea
and the First Council of Constantinople. "Nestorian" is an outsider's term for
a tradition that predated the influence of Nestorius. Thus, "Persian Church" is
a more neutral term. Conversion of East and South Slavs. In the 9th and 10th
centuries, Christianity made great inroads into Eastern Europe, including
Kievan Rus'. This work was made possible by the work of the Byzantine-Era
saints Cyril and Methodius. When Rastislav, the king of Moravia, asked
Byzantium for teachers who could minister to the Moravians in their own
language, Byzantine emperor Michael III chose these two brothers. Cyril and
Methodius translated the Bible and many of the prayer books. As the
translations prepared by them were copied by speakers of other dialects, the
hybrid literary language Old Church Slavonic was created. Originally sent to
convert the Slavs of Great Moravia, Cyril and Methodius were forced to compete
with Frankish missionaries from the Roman diocese. Their disciples were driven
out of Great Moravia in AD 886. Some of the disciples, namely Saint Clement of
Ohrid and Saint Naum, were of great importance to the Orthodox Faith in
Bulgaria. In a short time, the disciples of Cyril and Methodius managed to
prepare and instruct the future Bulgarian clergy into the biblical texts and in
AD 893, proclaimed the first organized Church on the Balkan Peninsula. The
success of the conversion of the Bulgarians facilitated the conversion of East
Slavic peoples, most notably the Rus', predecessors of Belarusians, Russians,
and Ukrainians. The work of the Thessaloniki brothers Cyril and Methodius and
their disciples had a major impact to Serbs as well. However, they accepted
Christianity collectively by families and by tribes (in the process between the
7th and the 9th century). In commemoration of their baptisms, each Serbian
family or tribe began to celebrate an exclusively Serbian custom called Slava
in a special way to honor the Saint on whose day they received the sacrament of
Holy Baptism. It is the most solemn day of the year for all Serbs of the
Orthodox faith and has played a role of vital importance in the history of the
Serbian people. Slava is actually the celebration of the spiritual birthday of
the Serbian people which the Church blessed and proclaimed it a Church
institution. The missionaries to the East and South Slavs had great success in
part because they used the people's native language rather than Greek, the
predominant language of the Byzantine Empire or Latin as the Roman priests did.
Today the Russian Orthodox Church is the largest of the Orthodox Churches
followed by the Romanian Orthodox Church. Great Schism. In the 11th century
what was recognised as the Great Schism took place between Rome and
Constantinople, which led to separation between the Church of the West, the
Roman Catholic Church, and the Eastern Byzantine Churches, now the Orthodox.
There were doctrinal issues like the filioque clause and the authority of the
Roman Pope involved in the split, but these were greatly exacerbated by
political factors of both Church and state, and by cultural and linguistic
differences between Latins and Greeks. Prior to 1054, the Eastern and Western
halves of the Church had frequently been in conflict, particularly during the
periods of Eastern iconoclasm and the Photian schism. The final breach is often
considered to have arisen after the capture and sacking of Constantinople by
the Fourth Crusade in 1204; the final break with Rome occurred circa 1450. The
sacking of Church of Holy Wisdom and establishment of the Latin Empire as a
seeming attempt to supplant the Orthodox Byzantine Empire in 1204 is viewed
with some rancour to the present day. In 2004, Pope John Paul II extended a
formal apology for the sacking of Constantinople in 1204, which was importantly
also strongly condemned by the Pope at the time (Innocent III, see reference at
end of paragraph); the apology was formally accepted by Patriarch Bartholomew
of Constantinople. Many things that were stolen during this time —holy
relics, riches, and many other items—were not returned and are still held in
various Western European cities, particularly Venice. Reunion was attempted
twice, at the 1274 Second Council of Lyon and the 1439 Council of Florence. The
Council of Florence did briefly reestablish communion between East and West,
which lasted until after the fall of Constantinople in 1453. In each case,
however, the councils were rejected by the Orthodox people as a whole, and the
union of Florence also became very politically difficult after Constantinople
came under Ottoman rule, so in both cases came to fail. Some local Eastern
Churches have, however, renewed union with Rome in time since (see Eastern
Catholic Churches). Recent decades have seen a renewal of ecumenical spirit and
dialogue between the Churches. Age of captivity. In 1453, the Byzantine Empire
fell to the Ottoman Empire. By this time Egypt had been under Muslim control
for some seven centuries, but Orthodoxy was very strong in Russia which had
recently acquired an autocephalous status; and thus Moscow called itself the
Third Rome, as the cultural heir of Constantinople. Under Ottoman rule, the
Greek Orthodox Church acquired substantial power as an autonomous "millet". The
ecumenical patriarch was the religious and administrative ruler of the entire
"Greek Orthodox nation" (Ottoman administrative unit), which encompassed all
the Orthodox subjects of the Empire. Russian Orthodox Church in the Russian
Empire. Up until 1666, when Patriarch Nikon was deposed by the tsar, the
Russian Orthodox Church had been independent of the State. In 1721 the first
Russian Emperor, Peter I abolished completely the patriarchate and so the
Church effectively became a department of the government, ruled by a Most Holy
Synod composed of senior bishops and lay bureaucrats appointed by the Emperor
himself. Since 1721 until the October Revolution of 1917, the Russian Orthodox
Church was essentially transformed into a governmental agency, a tool used to
various degrees by the tsars in the imperial campaigns of Russification. The
Church was allowed by the State to levy taxes on the peasants. Therefore, the
Church, along with the imperial regime, to which it belonged, came to be
presented as an enemy of the people by the Bolsheviks and the other Russian
revolutionaries. Russian Orthodox Church in the Soviet Union. The revolution
brought a brief period of freedom from governmental control for the Church: an
independent patriarchate was reestablished briefly in 1917, until Vladimir
Lenin quashed the Church a few years later, imprisoning or killing many of the
clergy and of the faithful. Part of the clergy escaped the Bolshevik
persecutions by fleeing abroad, where they founded an independent church in
exile, reunified with the Russian one in 2007. The Orthodox Church clergy in
Russia were seen as sympathetic with the cause of the White Army in the Civil
War (see White movement) after the October Revolution, and occasionally
collaborated with it; Patriarch Tikhon's declared position was vehemently anti-
Bolshevik in 1918. This may have further strengthened the Bolshevik animus
against the church. Before and after the October Revolution of November 7, 1917
(October 25 Old Calendar) there was a movement within the Soviet Union to unite
all of the people of the world under Communist rule (see Communist
International). This included the Eastern European bloc countries as well as
the Balkan States. Since some of these Slavic states tied their ethnic heritage
to their ethnic churches, both the peoples and their church were targeted by
the Soviets. The Soviets' official interpretation of freedom of conscience was
one of "guaranteeing the right to profess any religion, or profess none, to
practice religious cults, or conduct atheist propaganda", though in effect
atheism was sponsored by state and was taught in all educational
establishments. Public criticism of atheism was unofficially forbidden and
sometimes led to imprisonment. The Soviet Union was the first state to have as
an ideological objective the elimination of religion. Toward that end, the
Communist regime confiscated church property, ridiculed religion, harassed
believers, and propagated atheism in the schools. Actions toward particular
religions, however, were determined by State interests, and most organized
religions were never outlawed. Some actions against Orthodox priests and
believers along with execution included torture being sent to prison camps,
labour camps or mental hospitals. The result of state sponsored atheism was to
transform the Church into a persecuted and martyred Church. In the first five
years after the Bolshevik revolution, 28 bishops and 1,200 priests were
executed. After Nazi Germany's attack on the Soviet Union in 1941, Joseph
Stalin revived the Russian Orthodox Church to intensify patriotic support for
the war effort. By 1957 about 22,000 Russian Orthodox churches had become
active. But in 1959 Nikita Khrushchev initiated his own campaign against the
Russian Orthodox Church and forced the closure of about 12,000 churches. It is
estimated that 50,000 clergy had been executed between the revolution and the
end of the Khrushchev era. Members of the church hierarchy were jailed or
forced out, their places taken by docile clergy, many of whom had ties with the
KGB. By 1985 fewer than 7,000 churches remained active. In the Soviet Union, in
addition to the methodical closing and destruction of churches, the charitable
and social work formerly done by ecclesiastical authorities was taken over by
the state. As with all private property, Church owned property was confiscated
into public use. The few places of worship left to the Church were legally
viewed as state property which the government permitted the church to use.
After the advent of state funded universal education, the Church was not
permitted to carry on educational, instructional activity of any kind. Outside
of sermons during the celebration of the divine liturgy it could not instruct
or evangelise to the faithful or its youth. Catechism classes, religious
schools, study groups, Sunday schools and religious publications were all
illegal or banned. This persecution continued, even after the death of Stalin
until the Fall of Communism in 1991. This caused many religious tracts to be
circulated as illegal literature or samizdat. Among the most damaging aspects
of Soviet rule, along with these physical abuses, the Soviet Union frequently
manipulated the recruitment and appointment of priests, sometimes planting
agents of the KGB within the church to monitor religious persons who were
viewed – simply for not being atheists – as suspicious and potential
threats to Soviet communism. The recovery of religious beliefs in Russia after
the fall of communism, part of a significant religious revival, has been made
more challenging as a result of those leaders forced involuntarily upon the
church by the KGB during Soviet times. Other Orthodox Churches in the Soviet
Union. Albania was the only state to have declared itself officially fully
atheist. In some other communist states such as Romania, the Orthodox Church as
an organization enjoyed relative freedom and even prospered, albeit under
strict secret police control. That, however, did not rule out demolishing
churches and monasteries as part of broader systematization (urban planning),
and state persecution of individual believers. As an example of the latter,
Romania stands out as a country which ran a specialized institution where many
Orthodox (along with people of other faiths) were subjected to psychological
punishment or torture and mind control experimentation in order to force them
give up their religious convictions. However, this was only supported by one
faction within the regime, and lasted only three years. The Communist
authorities closed down the prison in 1952, and punished many of those
responsible for abuses (twenty of them were sentenced to death). Relations with
other Christians. Orthodoxy represents the majority of Eastern Christianity.
The Orthodox trace their bishops back to the apostles through apostolic
succession, venerate saints, especially Mary the Mother of God as the
Theotokos, pray for the dead, and continue the ancient Christian practice of
monasticism. Orthodoxy does not openly promote statuary, although it is not
expressly condemned, instead limiting itself primarily to two-dimensional
iconography. The Western theological concepts of original sin, predestination,
purgatory and particular judgment are generally rejected by traditional
Orthodox theologians. The Orthodox understand themselves to be the One Holy
Catholic and Apostolic Church; the true Church established by Jesus Christ and
placed into the care of the apostles. As almost all other Christian groups are
in indirect schism with the Orthodox Church, mostly as a result of the Great
Schism with the Roman Catholic Church at the turn of the second Christian
millennium (prior to the additional schisms of the Protestant Reformation),
these other groups are viewed as being Christian, but who in varying degrees
lack full theological orthodoxy and orthopraxy. As such, all groups outside of
the Orthodox Church are not seen as being members of the Church proper, but
rather separated brethren who have failed to retain the fullness of the
Christian faith and theology, as was given to the apostles by Jesus Christ.
These deviations from orthodoxy have traditionally been called heresy, but due
to the term's immediately pejorative connotations, some prefer the more
technical designation of the term heterodoxy. Hilarion Alfeyev, the
Metropolitan of Volokolamsk and head of external relations for the Moscow
Patriarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church, stated that Orthodox and
evangelical Christians share the same positions on "such issues as abortion,
the family, and marriage" and desire "vigorous grassroots engagement" between
the two Christian communions on such issues. Interfaith relations. Metropolitan
Alfeyev stated belief in the possibility of peaceful coexistence between Islam
and Christianity as the two religions have never had religious wars in Russia.
However, Alfeyev stated that the Russian Orthodox Church "disagrees with
atheist secularism in some areas very strongly" and "believes that it destroys
something very essential about human life." Church today. The various
autocephalous and autonomous synods of the Orthodox Church are distinct in
terms of administration and local culture, but for the most part exist in full
communion with one another. The Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (ROCOR)
has recently united with the Moscow Patriarchate (MP); these two branches of
the Russian Orthodox Church had separated from each other in the 1920s due to
the subjection of the latter to the hostile Soviet regime (see Act of Canonical
Communion). Tensions exist in the philosophical differences between those who
use the Revised Julian Calendar ("New Calendarists") for calculating the feasts
of the ecclesiastical year and those who continue to use the traditional Julian
Calendar ("Old Calendarists"). The calendar question reflects the dispute
between those who wish to synchronize with the modern Gregorian calendar, which
its opponents consider unnecessary and damaging to continuity, and those who
wish to maintain the traditional ecclesiastical calendar (which happens to be
based on the Julian calendar), arguing that such a modern change goes against
1900 years of Church tradition and was in fact perpetrated without an
ecumenical council, which would surely have rejected the idea. The dispute has
led to much acrimony, and sometimes even to violence. Following canonical
precepts, some adherents of the Old Calendar have chosen to abstain from
clerical intercommunion with those synods which have embraced the New Calendar
until the conflict is resolved. The monastic communities on Mount Athos have
provided the strongest opposition to the New Calendar, and to modernism in
general, while still maintaining communion with their mother church. Some
latent discontent between different national churches exists also in part due
to different approach towards ecumenism. While the Ecumenical Patriarch of
Constantinople, the Orthodox bishops in North America gathered into the
Standing Conference of the Canonical Orthodox Bishops in the Americas (SCOBA),
Romanian bishops, and others are fairly open to dialog with the Roman Catholic
Church, both conservative and moderate Old Calendarists, many of the monks of
Mount Athos, several bishops of Russian, Serbian, and some of Greek and
Bulgarian churches regard ecumenism as compromising essential doctrinal stands
in order to accommodate other Christians, and object to the emphasis on
dialogue leading to inter-communion; believing instead that Orthodox must speak
the truth with love, in the hope of leading to the eventual conversion to
Orthodoxy of heterodox Christians. Eastern Orthodox churches in communion. The
Orthodox Church is a communion of 14 autocephalous (that is, administratively
completely independent) local churches plus the Orthodox Church in America
which is recognized as autocephalous only by the Russian, Bulgarian, Georgian,
Polish, and Czech-Slovak Churches. Each has defined geographical boundaries of
its jurisdiction and is ruled by its Council of Bishops or Synod presided by a
senior bishop – its Primate (or First Hierarch). The Primate may carry the
honorary title of Patriarch, Metropolitan (in the Slavic tradition) or
Archbishop (in the Greek tradition). Each local church consists of constituent
eparchies (or, dioceses) ruled by a bishop. Some churches have given an eparchy
or group of eparchies varying degrees of autonomy (self-government). Such
autonomous churches maintain varying levels of dependence on their mother
church, usually defined in a Tomos or other document of autonomy. Below is a
list of the 14 (15) autocephalous churches in their order of precedence
(seniority) with constituent autonomous churches and exarchates. The Liturgical
title of the Primate is listed in italics. Note, that the Russian Church
recognized a different order of seniority, in which the Georgian church comes
after the Church of Russia and the Albanian Church – after the Church of
Greece. The Church of Cyprus also has a different list featuring herself
immediately after the ancient Patriarchates and before that of Moscow. The
jurisdiction of the Sinai peninsula could be Autocephalous but is disputed
because it consists solely of a monastery and its "metochia" and its Archbishop
is the Abbot who must be ordained by the Patriarch of Jerusalem. Orthodox
Churches and communities not in communion with others. The following is list of
some of the organizations that use the term "Orthodox" in their name but do not
maintain communion with any of the 14 (15) autocephalous churches and thus are
not typically considered part of the Orthodox Christian communion. Old
Calendarists are groups that do not maintain communion with the 14 (15)
autocephalous churches as a result of the use of the Revised Julian Calendar.
Old Believers are groups that do not accept liturgical reforms carried out in
the Russian Orthodox Church by Patriarch Nikon in the 17th century. Churches
with irregular or unresolved canonical status are entities that have carried
out episcopal consecrations outside of the norms of canon law or whose bishops
have been excommunicated by one of the 14 (15) autocephalous churches.
