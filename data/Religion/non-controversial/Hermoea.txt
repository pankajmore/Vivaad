Hermes Hermes (; Greek ) was an Olympian god in Greek religion and mythology,
son of Zeus and the Pleiade Maia. He was second youngest of the Olympian gods.
Hermes was a god of transitions and boundaries. He was quick and cunning, and
moved freely between the worlds of the mortal and divine, as emissary and
messenger of the gods, intercessor between mortals and the divine, and
conductor of souls into the afterlife. He was protector and patron of
travelers, herdsmen, thieves, orators and wit, literature and poets, athletics
and sports, invention and trade. In some myths he is a trickster, and outwits
other gods for his own satisfaction or the sake of humankind. His attributes
and symbols include the herma, the rooster and the tortoise, purse or pouch,
winged sandals, winged cap, and his main symbol was the herald's staff, the
Greek "kerykeion" or Latin "caduceus" which consisted of two snakes wrapped
around a winged staff. In the Roman adaptation of the Greek pantheon (see
"interpretatio romana"), Hermes was identified with the Roman god Mercury, who,
though inherited from the Etruscans, developed many similar characteristics,
such as being the patron of commerce. Etymology. The earliest form of the name
"Hermes" is the Mycenaean Greek "e-ma-a2 ", written in Linear B syllabic
script. Most scholars derive "Hermes" from Greek "herma" (a stone, roadside
shrine or boundary marker), dedicated to Hermes as a god of travelers and
boundaries; the etymology of "herma" itself is unknown. "Hermes" may be related
to Greek "hermeneus" ("the interpreter"), reflecting Hermes' function as divine
messenger. Plato offers a Socratic folk-etymology for Hermes' name, deriving it
from the divine messenger's reliance on "eirein" (the power of speech).
Scholarly speculation that "Hermes" derives from a more primitive form meaning
"one cairn" is disputed. The word "hermeneutics", the study and theory of
interpretation, is derived from "hermeneus". In Greek a lucky find was a
"hermaion". Mythology. Early Greek sources. Homer and Hesiod portrayed Hermes
as the author of skilled or deceptive acts, and also as a benefactor of
mortals. In the "Iliad" he was called "the bringer of good luck," "guide and
guardian" and "excellent in all the tricks." He was a divine ally of the Greeks
against the Trojans. However, he did protect Priam when he went to the Greek
camp to retrieve the body of his son Hector. When Priam got it, Hermes took
them back to Troy. He also rescued Ares from a brazen vessel where he had been
imprisoned by Otus and Ephialtes. In the "Odyssey" he helped his great-grand
son, the protagonist, Odysseus, informing him about the fate of his companions,
who were turned into animals by the power of Circe, and instructed him to
protect himself by chewing a magic herb; he also told Calypso Zeus' order for
her to free the same hero from her island to continue his journey back home.
When Odysseus killed the suitors of his wife, Hermes lead their souls to Hades.
In "The Works and Days", when Zeus ordered Hephaestus to create Pandora to
disgrace humanity by punishing the act of Prometheus giving fire to man, every
god gave her a gift, and Hermesâ€™ gift was lies and seductive words, and a
dubious character. Then he was instructed to take her as wife to Epimetheus.
Many other myths feature Hermes. Aeschylus wrote that Hermes helped Orestes
kill Clytemnestra under a false identity and other stratagems, and also said
that he was the god of searches, and those who seek things lost or stolen.
Sophocles wrote that Odysseus invoked him when he needed to convince
Philoctetes to join the Trojan War on the side of the Greeks, and Euripides did
appear to help in spy Dolon Greek navy. Aesop, who allegedly received his
literary talents from Hermes, featured him in several of his fables, as ruler
of the gate of prophetic dreams, as the god of athletes, of edible roots, and
of hospitality. He also said that Hermes had assigned each person his share of
intelligence. Pindar and Aristophanes also document his recent association with
the gym, which did not exist at the time of Homer. The Homeric hymn to Hermes
invokes him as the one "of many shifts ("polytropos"), blandly cunning, a
robber, a cattle driver, a bringer of dreams, a watcher by night, a thief at
the gates, one who was soon to show forth wonderful deeds among the deathless
gods." Hermes, as an inventor of fire, is a parallel of the Titan, Prometheus.
In addition to the lyre, Hermes was believed to have invented many types of
racing and the sports of wrestling and boxing, and therefore was a patron of
athletes. Hellenistic Greek sources. Several writers of the Hellenistic period
expanded the list of Hermesâ€™ achievements. Callimachus said he disguised
himself as a cyclops to scare the Oceanides and was disobedient to his mother.
One of the Orphic Hymns Khthonios is dedicated to Hermes, indicating that he
was also a god of the underworld. Aeschylus had called him by this epithet
several times. Another is the Orphic Hymn to Hermes, where his association with
the athletic games held in tone is mystic. Phlegon of Tralles said he was
invoked to ward off ghosts, and Pseudo-Apollodorus reported several events
involving Hermes. He participated in the Gigantomachy in defense of Olympus;
was given the task of bringing baby Dionysus to be cared for by Ino and Athamas
and later by nymphs of Asia, followed Hera, Athena and Aphrodite in a beauty
contest; favored the young Hercules by giving him a sword when he finished his
education and lent his sandals to Perseus. The Thracian princes identified him
with their god Zalmoxis, considering his ancestor. called "Hermes of the Ways"
after the patronage of travellers. Epithets of Hermes. Argeiphontes. Hermes'
epithet "Argeiphontes" (), meaning "Argus-slayer", recalls his slaying of the
hundred-eyed giant Argus Panoptes, who was watching over the heifer-nymph Io in
the sanctuary of Queen Hera herself in Argos. Hermes placed a charm on Argus's
eyes with the caduceus to cause the giant to sleep, after this he slew the
giant. Argus' eyes were then put into the tail of the peacock, symbol of the
goddess Hera. Trade. and deception (Euripedes) and (possibly evil) tricks and
trickeries, crafty (from "lit". god of craft ), "the cheat", god of stealth and
of cunning, (see also to act secretively as "kleptein" in reference - "EL
Wheeler"), of treachery, "the schemer", wily, was worshipped at Pellene vii.
27, 1), and invoked through Odysseus. Hermes is "amoral" like a baby. although
Zeus sent Hermes as a teacher to humanity to teach them knowledge of and value
of justice and to improve inter-personal relationships ("bonding between
mortals"). Worship and cult. Prior to being known as Hermes,Frothingham thought
the god to have existed as a snake-god. Angelo (1997) thinks Hermes to be based
on the Thoth archetype. The absorbing ("combining") of the attributes of Hermes
to Thoth developed after the time of Homer amongst Greek and Roman; Herodotus
was the first to identify the Greek god with the Egyptian (Hermopolis),
Plutarch and Diodorus also, although Plato thought the gods to be dis-similar
(Friedlander 1992). A cult was established in Greece in remote regions, likely
making him a god of nature, farmers and shepherds. It is also possible that
since the beginning he has been a deity with shamanic attributes linked to
divination, reconciliation, magic, sacrifices, and initiation and contact with
other planes of existence, a role of mediator between the worlds of the visible
and invisible. During the third century BC a communication between Petosiris (a
priest) to King Nechopso, probably written in Alexandria c.150 BC, states
Hermes is the teacher of all secret wisdoms available to knowing by the
experience of religious ecstasy. Due to his constant mobility, he was
considered the god of commerce and social intercourse, the wealth brought in
business, especially sudden or unexpected enrichment, travel, roads and
crossroads, borders and boundary conditions or transient, the changes from the
threshold, agreements and contracts, friendship, hospitality, sexual
intercourse, games, data, the draw, good luck, the sacrifices and the
sacrificial animals, flocks and shepherds and the fertility of land and cattle.
In addition to serving as messenger to Zeus, Hermes carried the souls of the
dead to Hades, and directed the dreams sent by Zeus to mortals. Temples. One of
the oldest places of worship for Hermes was Mount Cilene in Arcadia, where the
myth says that he was born. Tradition says that his first temple was built by
Lycaon. From there the cult would have been taken to Athens, and them radiate
to the whole of Greece, according to Smith, and his temples and statues became
extremely numerous. Lucian of Samosata said he saw the temples of Hermes
everywhere. In many places, temples were consecrated in conjunction with
Aphrodite, as in Attica, Arcadia, Crete, Samos and in Magna Graecia. Several
ex-votos found in his temples revealed his role as initiator of young
adulthood, among them soldiers and hunters, since war and certain forms of
hunting were seen as ceremonial initiatory ordeals. This function of Hermes
explains why some images in temples and other vessels show him as a teenager.
As a patron of the gym and fighting, Hermes had statues in gyms and he was also
worshiped in the sanctuary of the Twelve Gods in Olympia, where Greeks
celebrated the Olympic Games. His statue was held there on an altar dedicated
to him and Apollo together. A temple within the Aventine was consecrated in 495
BC. Symbols of Hermes were the palm tree, turtle, rooster, goat, the number
four, several kinds of fish, incense. Sacrifices involved honey, cakes, pigs,
goats, and lambs. In the sanctuary of Hermes Promakhos in Tanagra is a
strawberry tree under which it was believed he had created, and in the hills
Phene ran three sources that were sacred to him, because he believed that they
had been bathed at birth. Festival. Hermesâ€™ feast was the special Hermaea was
celebrated with sacrifices to the god and with athletics and gymnastics,
possibly having been established in the sixth century BC, but no documentation
on the festival before the fourth century BC survives. However, Plato said that
Socrates attended a Hermaea. Of all the festivals involving Greek games, these
were the most like initiations because participation in them was restricted to
young boys and excluded adults. Hermai/Herms. In Ancient Greece, Hermes was a
phallic god of boundaries. His name, in the form "herma," was applied to a
wayside marker pile of stones; each traveller added a stone to the pile. In the
6th century BCE, Hipparchos, the son of Pisistratus, replaced the cairns that
marked the midway point between each village "deme" at the central "agora" of
Athens with a square or rectangular pillar of stone or bronze topped by a bust
of Hermes with a beard. An erect phallus rose from the base. In the more
primitive Mount Kyllini or Cyllenian herms, the standing stone or wooden pillar
was simply a carved phallus. In Athens, herms were placed outside houses for
good luck. "That a monument of this kind could be transformed into an Olympian
god is astounding," Walter Burkert remarked. In 415 BCE, when the Athenian
fleet was about to set sail for Syracuse during the Peloponnesian War, all of
the Athenian hermai were vandalized one night. The Athenians at the time
believed it was the work of saboteurs, either from Syracuse or from the anti-
war faction within Athens itself. Socrates' pupil Alcibiades was suspected of
involvement, and Socrates indirectly paid for the impiety with his life.
Hermes' offspring. Pan. The satyr-like Greek god of nature, shepherds and
flocks, Pan, could possibly be the son of Hermes through the nymph Dryope. In
the Homeric Hymn to Pan, Pan's mother fled in fright from her newborn son's
goat-like appearance. Priapus. Depending on the sources consulted, the god
Priapus could be understood as a son of Hermes. Autolycus. Autolycus, the
Prince of Thieves, was a son of Hermes and Chione (mortal) and grandfather of
Odysseus. Art and iconography. The image of Hermes evolved and varied according
to Greek art and culture. During Archaic Greece he was usually depicted as a
mature man, bearded, dressed as a traveler, herald, or pastor. During Classical
and Hellenistic Greece he is usually depicted young and nude, with athleticism,
as befits the god of speech and of the gymnastics, or a robe, a formula is set
predominantly through the centuries. When represented as Logios (speaker), his
attitude is consistent with the attribute. Phidias left a statue of a famous
Hermes Logios and Praxiteles another, also well known, showing him with
Dionysus baby arms. At all times, however, through the Hellenistic periods,
Roman, and throughout Western history into the present day, several of his
characteristic objects are present as identification, but not always all
together. Among these objects is a wide-brimmed hat, the Petasos, widely used
by rural people of antiquity to protect themselves from the sun, and that in
later times was adorned with a pair of small wings, sometimes the hat is not
present, but may then have wings rising from the hair. Another object is the
Porta a stick, called rhabdomyolysis (stick) or skeptron (scepter), which is
referred to as a magic wand. Some early sources say that this was the bat he
received from Apollo, but others question the merits of this claim. It seems
that there may have been two canes, with time in a cast, one of a shepherd's
staff, as stated in the Homeric Hymn, and the other a magic wand, according to
some authors. His bat also came to be called kerykeion, the caduceus, in later
times. Early depictions of the staff it show it as a baton stick topped by a
golden way that resembled the number eight, though sometimes with its top
truncated and open. Later the staff had two intertwined snakes and sometimes it
was crowned with a pair of wings and a ball, but the old form remained in use
even when Hermes was associated with Mercury by the Romans. Hyginus explained
the presence of snakes, saying that Hermes was traveling in Arcadia when he saw
two snakes intertwined in battle. He put the caduceus between them and parted,
and so said his staff would bring peace. The caduceus, historically, there
appeared with Hermes, and is documented among the Babylonians from about 3,500
BC. The two snakes coiled around a stick was a symbol of the god Ningishzida,
which served as a mediator between humans and the mother goddess Ishtar or the
supreme Ningirsu. In Greece itself the other gods have been depicted holding a
caduceus, but it was mainly associated with Hermes. It was said to have the
power to make people fall asleep or wake up, and also made peace between
litigants, and is a visible sign of his authority, being used as a sceptre. He
was represented in doorways, possibly as an amulet of good fortune, or as a
symbol of purification. The caduceus is not to be confused with the Rod of
Asclepius, the patron of medicine and son of Apollo, which bears only one
snake. The rod of Asclepius was adopted by most Western doctors as a badge of
their profession, but in several medical organizations of the United States,
the caduceus took its place since the eighteenth century, although this use is
declining. After the Renaissance the caduceus also appeared in the heraldic
crests of several, and currently is a symbol of commerce. His sandals, called
"pÃ©dila" by the Greeks and "talaria" by the Romans were made of palm and
myrtle branches, but were described as beautiful, golden and immortal, made a
sublime art, able to take the roads with the speed of wind. Originally they had
no wings, but late in the artistic representations, they are depicted. In
certain images, the wings spring directly from the ankles. He has also been
depicted with a purse or a bag in his hands, and wearing a robe or cloak, which
had the power to confer invisibility. His weapon was a sword of gold, which
killed Argos; lent to Perseus to kill Medusa. Modern psychological
interpretation. For Carl Jung Hermes was guide to the underworld is become the
god of the unconscious, the mediator of information between the conscious and
unconscious factors of the mind, and the archetypal messenger conveying
communication between realms. Hermes is seminally the guide for the inner
journey. Jung considered the gods Thoth and Hermes to be counterparts (Yoshida
2006). In Jungian psychology especially (by Combs and Holland 1994 ), Hermes is
thought relevant to study of the phenomenon of synchronicity ( together with
Pan and Dionysus) In the context of psycho-therapy Hermes is our inner
friendliness bringing together the disparate and perhaps isolated core elements
of our selves belonging to the realms of the other gods; He is for some
identified as the archetype of healer (LÃ³pez-Pedraza 2003) ... in ancient
Greece he healed through magic (McNeely 2011). In the context of abnormal
psychology Samuels (1986) states that Jung considers Hermes the archetype for
narcissistic disorder, but also lending the disorder a "positive" (beneficious)
aspect, that is Hermes is both the good and bad of narcissism. For LÃ³pez-
Pedraza, Hermes is the protector of psychotherapy. For McNeely, Hermes is a god
of the healing arts(p.Â 88 ). In a consideration of all the roles Hermes was
understood to have fulfilled in ancient Greece Christopher Booker gives the
genius of the god to be a guide or observer of transition. The trickster. For
Jung the trickster is the guide in total for the psychotherapeutic process
