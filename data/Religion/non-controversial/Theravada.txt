Theravada TheravƒÅda, "sthaviravƒÅda", is literally "the Teaching of the
Elders", and is the oldest surviving Buddhist branch. It is relatively
conservative, and according to Dr. Rupert Gethin, it is "generally" closer to
early Buddhism than the other existing Buddhist traditions. For many centuries,
Theravada has been the predominant religion of Sri Lanka (now about 70% of the
population) and most of continental Southeast Asia (Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar,
Thailand). Theravada is also practiced by minorities in parts of southwest
China (mainly by the Shan and Tai ethnic groups), Vietnam (by the Khmer Krom),
Bangladesh (by the ethnic groups of Baruas, Chakma, Magh, and Tanchangya),
Malaysia and Indonesia, while recently gaining popularity in Singapore and the
Western world. Today, Theravada Buddhists, otherwise known as Theravadins,
number over 150 million worldwide, and during the past few decades Theravada
Buddhism has begun to take root in the West and in the Buddhist revival in
India. History. Indian origins. The name Theravada comes from the ancestral
Sthaviravada, from which the Theravadins claim descent. According to Andrew
Skilton, after unsuccessfully trying to modify the Vinaya, a small group of
'elderly members' i.e. "sthaviras" broke away from the majority
MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika during the Second Buddhist council, giving rise to the
Sthaviravada. According to its own accounts, the TheravƒÅda school is
fundamentally derived from the VibhajjavƒÅda (or "doctrine of analysis")
grouping which was a division of the Sthaviravada. Theravadin accounts of its
own origins mention that it received the teachings that were agreed upon the
Third Buddhist Council, around 250 BCE, and these teachings were known as the
Vibhajjavada. The VibhajjavƒÅdins in turn split into four groups: the
Mahƒ´≈õƒÅsaka, KƒÅ≈õyapƒ´ya, Dharmaguptaka, and the TƒÅmraparnƒ´ya. Sri Lanka.
The Theravada is descended from the TƒÅmraparnƒ´ya, which means "the Sri Lankan
lineage." In the 7th century CE, Chinese pilgrims Xuanzang and Yijing refer to
the Buddhist schools in Sri Lanka as "Sh√ ngzu√≤b√π" (Ch. ‰∏äÂ∫ßÈÉ®),
corresponding to the Sanskrit "Sthavira NikƒÅya" and the Pali "Thera NikƒÅya."
The school has been using the name "Theravada" for itself in a written form
since at least the 4th century, when the term appears in the "Dipavamsa".
Transmission to Sri Lanka. According to Buddhist scholar A.K. Warder, the
Theravada According to the PƒÅli chronicles of the Sinhalese tradition,
Buddhism was first brought to Sri Lanka by Arahant Mahinda, who is believed to
have been the son of the Mauryan emperor Asoka, in the third century BCE, as a
part of the "dhammaduta" (missionary) activities of the Asokan era. In Sri
Lanka, Arahant Mahinda established the MahƒÅvihƒÅra Monastery of Anuradhapura.
Subdivisions. Over much of the early history of Buddhism in Sri Lanka, three
subdivisions of TheravƒÅda existed in Sri Lanka, consisting of the monks of the
MahƒÅvihƒÅra, Abhayagiri VihƒÅra, and the Jetavana VihƒÅra. MahƒÅvihƒÅra is the
first tradition to be established, while Abhayagiri VihƒÅra and Jetavana
VihƒÅra is established by monks who have broke away from MahƒÅvihƒÅra
tradition. According to A.K. Warder, the Indian Mahƒ´≈õƒÅsaka sect also
established itself in Sri Lanka alongside the TheravƒÅda, into which they were
later absorbed. Northern regions of Sri Lanka also seem to have been ceded to
sects from India at certain times. When the Chinese monk Faxian visited the
island in the early 5th century CE, he noted 5000 monks at Abhayagiri, 3000
monks at the MahƒÅvihƒÅra, and 2000 monks at the CetiyapabbatavihƒÅra.
Mahayana-influences. Over the centuries, the Abhayagiri TheravƒÅdins maintained
close relations with Indian Buddhists and adopted many new teachings from
India. including many elements from MahƒÅyƒÅna teachings, while the Jetavana
TheravƒÅdins adopted MahƒÅyƒÅna to a lesser extent. Xuanzang wrote of two major
divisions of TheravƒÅda in Sri Lanka, referring to the Abhayagiri tradition as
the "MahƒÅyƒÅna Sthaviras," and the MahƒÅvihƒÅra tradition as the "Hƒ´nayƒÅna
Sthaviras." Akira Hirakawa notes that the surviving PƒÅli commentaries
("Atthakatha") of the MahƒÅvihƒÅra school, when examined closely, also include
a number of positions that agree with MahƒÅyƒÅna teachings. Kalupahana notes
the same for the Visuddhimagga, the most important Theravada commentary. In the
8th century CE, it is known that both MahƒÅyƒÅna and the esoteric VajrayƒÅna
form of Buddhism were being practiced in Sri Lanka, and two Indian monks
responsible for propagating Esoteric Buddhism in China, Vajrabodhi and
Amoghavajra, visited the island during this time. Abhayagiri VihƒÅra appears to
have been a center for Theravadin MahƒÅyƒÅna and VajrayƒÅna teachings.
Abolition of other TheravƒÅda traditions. Some scholars have held that the
rulers of Sri Lanka ensured that TheravƒÅda remained traditional, and that this
characteristic contrasts with Indian Buddhism. However, before the 12th century
CE, more rulers of Sri Lanka gave support and patronage to the Abhayagiri
TheravƒÅdins, and travelers such as Faxian saw the Abhayagiri TheravƒÅdins as
the main Buddhist tradition in Sri Lanka. The trend of Abhayagiri Vihara being
the dominant TheravƒÅda sect changed in the 12th century CE, when the
MahƒÅvihƒÅra gained the political support of King ParakkamabƒÅhu I (1153-1186
CE), and completely abolished the Abhayagiri and Jetavana TheravƒÅda
traditions. The TheravƒÅda monks of these two traditions were then defrocked
and given the choice of either returning to the laity permanently, or
attempting re-ordination under the MahƒÅvihƒÅra tradition as "novices"
("samanera"). Regarding the differences between these three TheravƒÅda
traditions, the "Culavamsa" laments, "Despite the vast efforts made in every
way by former kings down to the present day, the Bhikkhus turned away in their
demeanor from one another and took delight in all kinds of strife." Lineage of
nuns. A few years after the arrival of Sthavira Mahinda, Bhikkhuni Sanghamitta,
who is also believed to be the daughter of Emperor Asoka, came to Sri Lanka.
She started the first nun's order in Sri Lanka, but this order of nuns died out
in Sri Lanka in the 11th century and in Burma in the 13th. In 429 CE, by
request of China's emperor, nuns from Anuradhapura were sent to China to
establish the Nun's Order. The order was then spread to Korea. In 1996, 11
selected Sri Lankan nuns were ordained fully as Bhikkhunis by a team of
TheravƒÅda monks in concert with a team of Korean Nuns in India. There is
disagreement among Theravada vinaya authorities as to whether such ordinations
are valid. In the last few years the head of the Dambulla chapter of the Siyam
Nikaya in Sri Lanka has carried out ordination ceremonies for hundreds of nuns.
This has been criticized by other leading figures in the Siyam Nikaya and
Amarapura Nikaya, and the governing council of Burmese Buddhism has declared
that there can be no valid ordination of nuns in modern times, though some
Burmese monks disagree with this. Southeast Asia. According to Mahavamsa the
Sri Lanka chronicle, after the conclusion of the Third Buddhist Council, a
missionary was also sent to Suvannabhumi where two monks Sona and Uttara, are
said to have proceeded. Scholar opinions differ as to where exactly this land
of Suvannabhumi is located, but Suvannabhumi is believed to be located
somewhere in the area which now includes lower Burma, Thailand, Malay Peninsula
and Sumatra Island. Before the 12th century, the areas of Thailand, Burma,
Laos, and Cambodia were dominated by various Buddhist sects from India, and
included the teachings of MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism. In the 7th century, Yijing noted
in his travels that in these areas, all major sects of Indian Buddhism
flourished. Burma. Though there are some early accounts that have been
interpreted as TheravƒÅda in Burma, the surviving records show that most
Burmese Buddhism incorporated MahƒÅyƒÅna, and used Sanskrit rather than Pali.
After the decline of Buddhism in India, missions of monks from Sri Lanka
gradually converted Burmese Buddhism to TheravƒÅda, and in the next two
centuries also brought TheravƒÅda Buddhism to the areas of Thailand, Laos, and
Cambodia, where it supplanted previous forms of Buddhism. The Mon and Pyu were
among the earliest people to inhabit Burma. Recent archaeological research at a
Pyu settlement in the Samon Valley (around 100¬ km south-east of Bagan) has
shown that they had trade links with India from 500-400 BC and with China
around 200 BC. Chinese sources which have been dated to around 240 A.D. mention
a Buddhist kingdom by the name of Lin-Yang, which some scholars have identified
as the ancient Pyu kingdom of Beikthano The Burmese slowly became Theravadan
when they came into contact with the Pyu and Mon civilization. The Thais also
slowly became Theravadan as they came into contact with the Mon civilization.
China. Despite its success in Southeast Asia, Theravada Buddhism in China has
generally been limited to areas bordering Theravada countries. Modernisation
and spread to the west. [[Image:Yattawmu Paya.JPG|thumb|Laykyun Setkyar in the
village of Khatakan Taung, near Monywa in Burma. The second tallest statue in
the world.]] In the 19th century began a process of mutual influence of both
Asian Theravadins and a western audience interested in ancient wisdom.
Especially Helena Blavatsky and Henry Steel Olcott, founders of the
Theosophical Society had a profound role in this process. In Theravada
countries developed a lay vipassana practice. From the 1970s on western
interest gave way to the growth of the so-called Vipassana movement in the
west. Reaction against western colonialism. Buddhist revivalism has also
reacted against changes in Buddhism caused by colonialist regimes. Western
colonialists and Christian missionaries deliberately imposed a particular type
of Christian monasticism on Buddhist clergy in Sri Lanka and colonies in
Southeast Asia, restricting monks' activities to individual purification and
temple ministries. Prior to British colonial control, monks in both Sri Lanka
and Burma had been responsible for the education of the children of lay people,
and had produced large bodies of literature. After the British takeover,
Buddhist temples were strictly administered and were only permitted to use
their funds on strictly religious activities. Christian ministers were given
control of the education system and their pay became state funding for
missions. Foreign, especially British, rule had an enervating effect on the
sangha. According to Walpola Rahula, Christian missionaries displaced and
appropriated the educational, social, and welfare activities of the monks, and
inculcated a permanent shift in views regarding the proper position of monks in
society through their institutional influence upon the elite. Many monks in
post-colonial times have been dedicated to undoing this paradigm shift.
Movements intending to restore Buddhism's place in society have developed in
both Sri Lanka and Burma. One of the results of the reactions against western
colonialism was the modernisation of Theravada Buddhism, incorporating western
elements, and opening meditation practice for a lay audience. It are those
modernized forms of Theravada practice which have been spread to the west. Sri
Lanka. At Sri Lanka Theravadins were looking at western culture to find means
to revitalize their own tradition. Christian missionaries were threatening the
indigenous culture. As a reaction, Theravadins started to propagate Theravada
Buddhism. They were aided by Theosophists, who were looking for ancient wisdom,
and expected this to be found, among other possible sources, within Buddhism
and the Pali Canon. Anagarika Dharmapala was one of the Theravada leaders with
whom the Theosophists sided. Dharmapala tried to reinstate vipassana, taking
the Visuddhimagga and the Pali Canon to find out a workable method. Dharmapala
reached out to the middle classes, offering them religious practice and a
religious identity, which were used to withstand the British imperialists. A
practical consequence was a change in the religious configuration of the
island, with lay practitioners practicing meditation, which before was reserved
for monks. The translation and publication of the Pali Canon by the Pali Text
Society, which for the first time in history made the Pali Canon available to a
lay audience, not only in the west, but also in the east. Western lay interest
in Theravada Buddhism was promoted by the Theosophical Society, and endured
until the beginning of the 20th century. During the 1970s interest rose again,
leading to a surge of westerners searching for enlightenment, and the
republishing of the Pali Canon, first in print, and later also at the web.
Thailand. With the coming to power in 1851 of King Mongkut, who had been a monk
himself for twenty-seven years, the sangha, like the kingdom, became steadily
more centralized and hierarchical, and its links to the state more
institutionalized. Mongkut was a distinguished scholar of Pali Buddhist
scripture. Moreover, at that time the immigration of numbers of monks from
Burma was introducing the more rigorous discipline characteristic of the Mon
sangha. Influenced by the Mon and guided by his own understanding of the
Tipitaka, Mongkut began a reform movement that later became the basis for the
Dhammayuttika order of monks. In the early 1900s, Thailand's Ajahn Sao
Kantasilo Mahathera and his student, Mun Bhuridatta led the Thai Forest
Tradition revival movement. In the 20th century notable practitioners included
Ajahn Thate, Ajahn Maha Bua and Ajahn Chah. It was later spread globally by
Ajahn Mun's students including Ajahn Thate, Ajahn Maha Bua and Ajahn Chah and
several western disciples, among whom the most senior is Luang Por Ajahn
Sumedho. Burma. Birmese Theravada Buddhism has had a profound influence on
modern vipassana practice, both for lay practitioners in Asia as lay
practitioners in the west. The so-called "New Burmese method" was developed by
U NƒÅrada and popularized by his students Mahasi Sayadaw and Nyanaponika Thera.
Another prominent teacher is Bhikkhu Bodhi, a student of Nyanaponika. The New
Burmese Method strongly emphasizes vipassana over samatha. It is regarded as a
simplification of traditional Buddhist meditation techniques, suitable not only
for monks but also for lay-practitioners. The method has been popularized in
the west by teachers as Joseph Goldstein, Jack Kornfield, Tara Brach, Gil
Fronsdal and Sharon Salzberg. The Ledi lineage begins with Ledi Sayadaw. S.N.
Goenka is a well-known teacher in the Ledi-lineage. According to S. N. Goenka,
vipassana-techniques are essentially non-sectarian in character, and have
universal application. One need not convert to Buddhism to practice these
styles of meditation. Meditation centers teaching the vipassanƒÅ popularized by
S. N. Goenka exist now in India, Asia, North and South America, Europe,
Australia, Middle East and Africa. Modern developments. The following modern
trends or movements have been identified. Doctrinal differences with other
schools. The Sthaviravada, from which Theravada is derived, differed from other
early Buddhist schools on a variety of teachings, which are maintained by the
Theravada school. The differences resulted from the systematizion of the
Buddhist teachings, which was preserved in the Abdhidhammas of the various
schools. The Abhidhamma is "a restatement of the doctrine of the Buddha in
strictly formalised language [...] assumed to constitute a consistent system of
philosophy". Its aim is not the empirical verification of the Buddhist
teachings, but "to set forth the correct interpretation of the Buddha's
statements in the "Sutra" to restate his 'system' with perfect accuracy". The
Arahant is perfect. The MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika believed that Arahants could regress,
while the Theravada believes that the Arahant has an "incorruptible nature".
Insight is sudden and perfect. According to the Sthaviravada/Theravada,
"progress in understanding comes all at once, 'insight' ("abhisamaya") does not
come 'gradually' (successively - "anapurva")". This is reflected in the
Theravada-account on the four levels of attainment, in which the attainment of
the four paths appears suddenly, and the defilements are rooted out at once.
The same stance is taken in the contemporary Vipassana movement, especially the
so-called "New Burmese Method". Teachings. Theravada promotes the concept of
Vibhajjavada (Pali), literally "Teaching of Analysis." This doctrine says that
insight must come from the aspirant's experience, critical investigation, and
reasoning instead of by blind faith. However, the scriptures of the Theravadin
tradition also emphasize heeding the advice of the wise, considering such
advice and evaluation of one's own experiences to be the two tests by which
practices should be judged. Theravada orthodoxy takes the seven stages of
purification as its basic outline of the path to be followed. The Theravada
Path starts with learning, to be followed by practice, culminating in the
realization of Nirvana. Learning. Defilements. In Theravada, the cause of human
existence and suffering ("dukkha") is identified as craving ("tanha"), which
carries with it the defilements ("kilesas"). Those defilements that bind humans
to the cycle of rebirth are classified into a set of ten "Fetters," while those
defilements that impede concentration ("samadhi") are presented in a fivefold
set called the "Five Hindrances." The level of defilement can be coarse,
medium, and subtle. It is a phenomenon that frequently arises, remains
temporarily and then vanishes. Theravadins believe defilements are not only
harmful to oneself, but also harmful to others. They are the driving force
behind all inhumanities a human being can commit. There are three stages of
defilements. During the stage of passivity the defilements lie dormant at the
base of the mental continuum as latent tendencies ("anusaya"), but through the
impact of sensory stimulus, they will manifest ("pariyutthana") themselves at
the surface of consciousness in the form of unwholesome thoughts, emotions, and
volitions. If they gather additional strength, the defilements will reach the
dangerous stage of transgression ("vitikkama"), which will then involve
physical or vocal actions. Ignorance. Theravadins believe these defilements are
habits born out of ignorance that afflict the minds of all unenlightened
beings, who cling to them and their influence in their ignorance of the truth.
But in reality, those mental defilements are nothing more than taints that have
afflicted the mind, creating suffering and stress. Unenlightened beings cling
to the body, under the assumption that it represents a Self, whereas in reality
the body is an impermanent phenomenon formed from the four basic elements.
Often characterized by earth, water, fire and air, in the early Buddhist texts
these are defined to be abstractions representing the sensorial qualities
solidity, fluidity, temperature, and mobility, respectively. The mental
defilements' frequent instigation and manipulation of the mind is believed to
have prevented the mind from seeing the true nature of reality. Unskillful
behavior in turn can strengthen the defilements, but following the Noble
Eightfold Path can weaken or eradicate them. Avijja is destroyed by insight.
Cause and Effect. The Concept of Cause and Effect, or Causality, is a key
concept in Theravada, and indeed, in Buddhism as a whole. This concept is
expressed in several ways, including the Four Noble Truths, and most
importantly, the Paticca-SamuppƒÅda (dependent co-arising). Abhidhamma in
Theravada canon differentiate between a root cause (Hetu) and facilitating
cause (pacca). By the combined interaction of both these, an effect is brought
about. On top of this view, a logic is built and elaborated whose most supple
form can be seen in the Paticca SamuppƒÅda. This concept is then used to
question the nature of suffering and to elucidate the way out of it, as
expressed in the Four Noble Truths. It is also employed in several suttas to
refute several philosophies including creationism. By taking away a cause, the
result will also disappear. From this follows the Buddhist path to end
suffering and existence in samsara. Practice. Theravada orthodoxy takes the
seven stages of purification as the basic outline of the path to be followed.
This basic outline is based on the threefold discipline of Sƒ´la (ethics or
discipline), SamƒÅdhi (meditative concentration), Pa√±√±a (understanding or
wisdom). The emphasis is on understanding the three marks of existence, which
removes vijnana, ignorance. Understanding destroys the Ten Fetters and leads to
Nirvana. Theravadins believe that every individual is personally responsible
for their own self-awakening and liberation, as they are the ones that were
responsible for their own actions and consequences (Sanskrit: "karma"; Pali:
"kamma"). Simply learning or believing in the true nature of reality as
expounded by the Buddha is not enough, the awakening can only be achieved
through direct experience and personal realization. Yet there is a widespread
belief in Theravada that we're living in a degenerated epoch, in which true
liberation is no longer possible. Noble Eightfold Path and Threefold
Discipline. The Noble Eightfold Path can also be summarized as the Three Noble
Disciplines. These are known as discipline ("sƒ´la"), wisdom ("pa√±√±ƒÅ"), and
training of mind ("samƒÅdhi"). Seven purifications. The Visuddhimagga, written
in the fifth century CE by Buddhaghosa, has become the orthodox account of the
Theravada path to liberation. It gives a sequence of seven purifications, based
on the sequence of sila, samadhi and prajna. It is composed of three sections,
which discuss: 1) "Sƒ´la" (ethics or discipline); 2) "SamƒÅdhi" (meditative
concentration); 3) "Pa√±√±a" (understanding or wisdom). The "Purification by
Knowledge and Vision" is the culmination of the practice, in four stages
leading to liberation and Nirvana. The emphasis in this system is on
understanding the three marks of existence, dukkha, anatta, anicca. This
emphasis is recognizable in the value that is given to vipassana over samatha,
especially in the contemporary Vipassana movement. Meditation. Meditation
(Pali: "Bhavana") means the positive reinforcement of one's mind. Broadly
categorized into Samatha and Vipassana, Meditation is the key tool implemented
in attaining jhana. Samatha literally means "to make skillful," and has other
renderings also, among which are "tranquilizing, calming," "visualizing," and
"achieving." Vipassana means "insight" or "abstract understanding." In this
context, Samatha Meditation makes a person skillful in concentration of mind.
Once the mind is sufficiently concentrated, Vipassana allows one to see through
the veil of ignorance. In order to be free from suffering and stress,
Theravadins believe that the defilements need to be permanently uprooted.
Initially the defilements are restrained through mindfulness to prevent them
from taking over mental and bodily action. They are then uprooted through
internal investigation, analysis, experience and understanding of their true
nature by using jhana. This process needs to be repeated for each and every
defilement. The practice will then lead the meditator to realize Nirvana.
Samatha meditation. The samatha meditation in Theravada is usually involved
with the concepts of Kamma·π≠·π≠hƒÅna which literally stands for "place of
work"; in this context, it is the "place" or object of concentration (PƒÅli:
"ƒÄrammana") where the mind is at work. In samatha meditation, the mind is set
at work concentrated on one particular entity. There are forty (40) such
classic objects (entities) used in samatha meditation, which are termed
Kamma·π≠·π≠hƒÅna. By acquiring a Kamma·π≠·π≠hƒÅna and practising samatha
meditation, one would be able to attain certain elevated states of awareness
and skill of the mind called Jhana. Practising samatha has samadhi
(concentration) as its ultimate goal. It should be noted that samatha is not a
method that is unique to Buddhism. In the "sutta"s it is said to be implemented
in other contemporary religions in India at the time of Buddha. In fact, the
first teachers of Siddhartha, before they attained the state of awakening
(PƒÅli: "Bodhi"), are said to have been quite skillful in samatha (although the
term had not been coined yet). In the Pali Canon discourses, the Buddha
frequently instructs his disciples to practice samadhi (concentration) in order
to establish and develop jhana (full concentration). Jhana is the instrument
used by the Buddha himself to penetrate the true nature of phenomena (through
investigation and direct experience) and to reach Enlightenment. Right
Concentration ("samma-samadhi") is one of the elements in the Noble Eightfold
Path. Samadhi can be developed from mindfulness developed with kamma·π≠·π≠hƒÅna
such as concentration on breathing ("anapanasati"), from visual objects
("kasina"), and repetition of phrases. The traditional list contains 40 objects
of meditation ("") to be used for Samatha Meditation. Every object has a
specific goal; for example, meditation on the parts of the body
("kayanupassana" or "kayagathasathi") will result in a lessening of attachment
to our own bodies and those of others, resulting in a reduction of sensual
desires. MettƒÅ (loving kindness) generates the feelings of goodwill and
happiness toward ourselves and other beings; metta practice serves as an
antidote to ill-will, wrath and fear. VipassanƒÅ meditation. VipassanƒÅ is the
ability to see everything as is. "Vi" in pali means great or beyond, while
"passanƒÅ" means to see. VipassanƒÅ then is concerned with seeing through the
veil of ignorance (PƒÅli: "AvijjƒÅ") and so, is unique to Buddhism. It can be
aided by a practised mind (with samatha) but samatha is not necessary to
practice vipassanƒÅ. Chiefly, vipassanƒÅ is involved in breaking the ten
Fetters that bind one to the ever-iterating cycle of birth and death i.e.
samsara. Some teachers do not distinguish between the two methods, rather
prescribing meditation methods that develop both concentration and insight.
Attainment. Nirvana. Nirvana (, '; , '; , "") is the ultimate goal of
Theravadins. It is a state where the fire of the passions has been 'blown out',
and the person is liberated from the repeated cycle of birth, illness, aging
and death. According to the early scriptures, the Nirvana attained by
"Arahants" is identical to that attained by the Buddha himself, as there is
only one type of Nirvana. Buddha was superior to "Arahants" because the Buddha
had discovered the path all by himself, and has taught it to others (i,e.,
metaphorically turning the wheel of Dhamma). "Arahants", on the other hand,
attained Nirvana due in part to the Buddha's teachings. Theravadins revere the
Buddha as a single supremely gifted person but do recognize the existence of
other such Buddhas in the distant past and future. Maitreya (Pali: Metteyya),
for example, is mentioned very briefly in the Pali Canon as a Buddha who will
come in the distant future. Scriptures. Pali Canon. The Theravada school
upholds the Pali Canon or Tipitaka as the most authoritative collection of
texts on the teachings of Gautama Buddha. The Sutta and Vinaya portion of the
Tipitaka shows considerable overlap in content to the Agamas, the parallel
collections used by non-Theravada schools in India which are preserved in
Chinese and partially in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and Tibetan, and the various non-
Theravada Vinayas. On this basis, both these sets of texts are generally
believed to be the oldest and most authoritative texts on Buddhism by scholars.
It is also believed that much of the Pali Canon, which is still used by
TheravƒÅda communities, was transmitted to Sri Lanka during the reign of Asoka.
After being orally transmitted (as was the custom in those days for religious
texts) for some centuries, were finally committed to writing in the last
century BC, at what the Theravada usually reckons as the fourth council, in Sri
Lanka. Theravada is one of the first Buddhist schools to commit the whole
complete set of its Buddhist canon into writing. Much of the material in the
Canon is not specifically "Theravadan," but is instead the collection of
teachings that this school preserved from the early, non-sectarian body of
teachings. According to Peter Harvey: Peter Harvey, "The Selfless Mind." Curzon
Press, 1995, page 9. The Pali Tipitaka consists of three parts: the Vinaya
Pitaka, Sutta Pitaka and Abhidhamma Pitaka. Of these, the Abhidhamma Pitaka is
believed to be a later addition to the first two pitakas, which, in the opinion
of many scholars, were the only two pitakas at the time of the First Buddhist
Council. The Pali Abhidhamma was not recognized outside the Theravada school.
The Tipitaka is composed of 45 volumes in the Thai edition, 40 in the Burmese
and 58 in the Sinhalese, and a full set of the Tipitaka is usually kept in its
own (medium-sized) cupboard. Commentaries. In the 4th or 5th century
Buddhaghosa Thera wrote the first Pali commentaries to much of the Tipitaka
(which were based on much older manuscripts, mostly in old Sinhalese). After
him many other monks wrote various commentaries, which have become part of the
Theravada heritage. These texts do not have the same authority as the Tipitaka
does, though Buddhaghosas Visuddhimagga is a cornerstone of the commentarial
tradition. The commentaries, together with the Abhidhamma, define the specific
Theravada heritage. Related versions of the Sutta Pitaka and Vinaya Pitaka were
common to all the early Buddhist schools, and therefore do not define only
Theravada, but also the other early Buddhist schools, and perhaps the teaching
of Gautama Buddha himself. Theravada Buddhists consider much of what is found
in the Chinese and Tibetan Mahayana scriptural collections to be apocryphal,
meaning that they are not authentic words of the Buddha. Lay and monastic life.
Distinction between lay and monastic life. Traditionally, Theravada Buddhism
has observed a distinction between the practices suitable for a lay person and
the practices undertaken by ordained monks (in ancient times, there was a
separate body of practices for nuns). While the possibility of significant
attainment by laymen is not entirely disregarded by the Theravada, it generally
occupies a position of less prominence than in the Mahayana and Vajrayana
traditions, with monastic life being hailed as a superior method of achieving
Nirvana. The view that Theravada, unlike other Buddhist schools, is primarily a
monastic tradition has, however, been disputed. This distinction between
ordained monks and laypeople¬ ‚Äî as well as the distinction between those
practices advocated by the Pali Canon, and the folk religious elements embraced
by many monks¬ ‚Äî have motivated some scholars to consider Theravada Buddhism
to be composed of multiple separate traditions, overlapping though still
distinct. Most prominently, the anthropologist Melford Spiro in his work
"Buddhism and Society" separated Burmese Theravada into three groups:
"Apotropaic Buddhism" (concerned with providing protection from evil spirits),
"Kammatic Buddhism" (concerned with making merit for a future birth), and
"Nibbanic Buddhism" (concerned with attaining the liberation of Nirvana, as
described in the Tipitaka). He stresses that all three are firmly rooted in the
Pali Canon. These categories are not accepted by all scholars, and are usually
considered non-exclusive by those who employ them. The role of lay people has
traditionally been primarily occupied with activities that are commonly termed
"merit making" (falling under Spiro's category of kammatic Buddhism). Merit
making activities include offering food and other basic necessities to monks,
making donations to temples and monasteries, burning incense or lighting
candles before images of the Buddha, and chanting protective or merit-making
verses from the Pali Canon. Some lay practitioners have always chosen to take a
more active role in religious affairs, while still maintaining their lay
status. Dedicated lay men and women sometimes act as trustees or custodians for
their temples, taking part in the financial planning and management of the
temple. Others may volunteer significant time in tending to the mundane needs
of local monks (by cooking, cleaning, maintaining temple facilities, etc.). Lay
activities have traditionally not extended to study of the Pali scriptures, nor
the practice of meditation, though in the 20th Century these areas have become
more accessible to the lay community, especially in Thailand. A number of
senior monastics in the Thai Forest Tradition, including Ajahn Buddhadasa,
Luang Ta Maha Bua, Ajahn Plien Panyapatipo, Ajahn Pasanno, and Ajahn Jayasaro,
have begun teaching meditation retreats outside of the monastery for lay
disciples. Ajahn Chah, a disciple of Ajahn Mun, set up a monastic lineage
called Cittaviveka with his disciple Ajahn Sumedho, at Chithurst in West
Sussex, England. Ajahn Sumedho later founded the Amaravati Buddhist Monastery
in Hertfordshire, which has a retreat center specifically for lay retreats.
Sumedho extended this to Harnham in Northumberland as "Aruna Ratanagiri" under
the present guidance of Ajahn Munindo, another disciple of Ajahn Chah. Scholar
monks and rural monks. Nirvana, the highest goal of Theravada Buddhism, is
attained through study and the practice of morality, meditation and wisdom
(sila, samadhi, panna). The goal of Nirvana (and its associated techniques)
have traditionally been seen as the domain of the fully ordained monastic,
whereas many of the same techniques can be used by laypeople to generate
happiness in their lives, without focusing on Nirvana. Monastic roles in the
Theravada can be broadly described as being split between the role of the
(often urban) scholar monk and the (often rural or forest) meditation monk.
Both types of monks serve their communities as spiritual teachers and
officiants by presiding over spiritual ceremonies and providing instruction in
basic Buddhist morality and teachings. Scholar monks undertake the path of
studying and preserving the Pali literature of the Theravada. They may devote
little time to the practice of meditation, but may attain great respect and
renown by becoming masters of a particular section of the Pali Canon or its
commentaries. Masters of the Abhidhamma, called Abhidhammika, are particularly
respected in the scholastic tradition. Meditation monks, often called forest
monks because of their association with certain wilderness-dwelling traditions,
are considered to be specialists in meditation. While some forest monks may
undertake significant study of the Pali Canon, in general meditation monks are
expected to learn primarily from their meditation experiences and personal
teachers, and may not know more of the Tipitaka than is necessary to
participate in liturgical life and to provide a foundation for fundamental
Buddhist teachings. More so than the scholastic tradition, the meditation
tradition is associated with the attainment of certain supernatural powers
described in both Pali sources and folk tradition. These powers include the
attainment of Nirvana, mind-reading, supernatural power over material objects
and their own material bodies, seeing and conversing with gods and beings
living in hell, and remembering their past lives. These powers are called
abhi√±√±a. Sometimes the remain of the cremated bone fragment of an
accomplished forest monk is believed able to transform itself into crystal-like
relics (sƒÅrira-dhƒÅtu). Ordination. The minimum age for ordaining as a
Buddhist monk is 20 years, reckoned from conception. However, boys under that
age are allowed to ordain as novices (samanera), performing a ceremony such as
"Shinbyu" in Burma. Novices shave their heads, wear the yellow robes, and
observe ten basic precepts. Although no specific minimum age for novices is
mentioned in the scriptures, traditionally boys as young as seven are accepted.
This tradition follows the story of the Lord Buddha‚Äôs son, Rahula, who was
allowed to become a novice at the age of seven. Monks follow 227 rules of
discipline, while nuns follow 311 rules. In most Theravada countries, it is a
common practice for young men to ordain as monks for a fixed period of time. In
Thailand and Burma, young men typically ordain for the 3 month Rain Retreat
(vassa), though shorter or longer periods of ordination are not rare.
Traditionally, temporary ordination was even more flexible among Laotians. Once
they had undergone their initial ordination as young men, Laotian men were
permitted to temporarily ordain again at any time, though married men were
expected to seek their wife's permission. Throughout Southeast Asia, there is
little stigma attached to leaving the monastic life. Monks regularly leave the
robes after acquiring an education, or when compelled by family obligations or
ill health. Ordaining as a monk, even for a short period, is seen as having
many virtues. In many Southeast Asian cultures, it is seen as a means for a
young man to "repay" his parents for their work and effort in raising him,
because the merit from his ordination accrues to them as well. Thai men who
have ordained as a monk may be seen as more fit husbands by Thai women, who
refer to men who have served as monks with a colloquial term meaning "ripe" to
indicate that they are more mature and ready for marriage. Particularly in
rural areas, temporary ordination of boys and young men traditionally gave
peasant boys an opportunity to gain an education in temple schools without
committing to a permanent monastic life. In Sri Lanka, temporary ordination is
not practiced, and a monk leaving the order is frowned upon. The continuing
influence of the caste system in Sri Lanka may play a role in the taboo against
temporary ordination and leaving the monkhood. Though Sri Lankan monastic
nikayas are often organized along caste lines, men who ordain as monks
temporarily pass outside of the conventional caste system, and as such during
their time as monks may act (or be treated) in a way that would not be in line
with the expected duties and privileges of their caste. Men and women born in
western countries, who become Buddhists as adults, wish to become monks or
nuns. It is possible, and one can live as a monk or nun in the country they
were born in, seek monks or nuns which has gathered in a different western
country or move to a monastery in countries like Sri Lanka or Thailand. It is
seen as being easier to live a life as a monk or nun in countries where people
generally live by the culture of Buddhism, since it is difficult to live by the
rules of a monk or a nun in a western country. For instance; a Theravada monk
or nun is not allowed to work, handle money, listen to music, cook and so on,
which are extremely difficult rules to live by in cultures which do not embrace
Buddhism. The recommendation is usually that to be able to live fully as a monk
or nun you should move to a monastery in a country with a culture that embraces
Theravada Buddhism. Some of the more well-known Theravadan monks are: Ajahn Mun
Bhuridatta, Ajahn Chah, Ledi Sayadaw, Ajahn Plien Panyapatipo, Ajahn Sumedho,
Ajahn Brahm, Bhikkhu Bodhi, Buddhadasa, Mahasi Sayadaw, Nyanaponika Thera,
Preah Maha Ghosananda, Sayadaw U Pandita, Ajahn Amaro, Thanissaro Bhikkhu,
Walpola Rahula, Bhante Henepola Gunaratana, and Bhante Yogavacara Rahula.
Monastic practices. The practices usually vary in different sub-schools and
monasteries within Theravada. But in the most orthodox forest monastery, the
monk usually models his practice and lifestyle on that of the Buddha and his
first generation of disciples by living close to nature in forest, mountains
and caves. Forest monasteries still keep alive the ancient traditions through
following the Buddhist monastic code of discipline in all its detail and
developing meditation in secluded forests. In a typical daily routine at the
monastery during the 3 month vassa period, the monk will wake up before dawn
and will begin the day with group chanting and meditation. At dawn the monks
will go out to surrounding villages bare-footed on alms-round and will have the
only meal of the day before noon by eating from the bowl by hand. Most of the
time is spent on Dhamma study and meditation. Sometimes the abbot or a senior
monk will give a Dhamma talk to the visitors. Laity who stay at the monastery
will have to abide by the traditional eight Buddhist precepts. The life of the
monk or nun in a community is much more complex than the life of the forest
monk. In the Buddhist society of Sri Lanka, most monks spend hours every day in
taking care of the needs of lay people such as preaching "bana," accepting
alms, officiating funerals, teaching "dhamma" to adults and children in
addition to providing social services to the community. After the end of the
Vassa period, many of the monks will go out far away from the monastery to find
a remote place (usually in the forest) where they can hang their umbrella tents
and where it is suitable for the work of self-development. When they go
wandering, they walk barefoot, and go wherever they feel inclined. Only those
requisites which are necessary will be carried along. These generally consist
of the bowl, the three robes, a bathing cloth, an umbrella tent, a mosquito
net, a kettle of water, a water filter, razor, sandals, some small candles, and
a candle lantern. The monks do not fix their times for walking and sitting
meditation, for as soon as they are free they just start doing it; nor do they
determine for how long they will go on to meditate. Some of them sometimes walk
from dusk to dawn whereas at other times they may walk from between two to
seven hours. Some may decide to fast for days or stay at dangerous places where
ferocious animals live in order to aid their meditation. Those monks who have
been able to achieve a high level of attainment will be able to guide the
junior monks and lay Buddhists toward the four degrees of spiritual attainment.
Lay devotee. In Pali the word for a male lay devotee is Upasaka. Upasika is its
female equivalent. One of the duties of the lay followers, as taught by the
Buddha, is to look after the needs of the monk/nuns. They are to see that the
monk/nuns do not suffer from lack of the four requisites: food, clothing,
shelter and medicine. As neither monks nor nuns are allowed to have an
occupation, they depend entirely on the laity for their sustenance. In return
for this charity, they are expected to lead exemplary lives. In Burma and
Thailand, the monastery was and is still regarded as a seat of learning. In
fact today about half of the primary schools in Thailand are located in
monasteries. Religious rituals and ceremonies held in a monastery are always
accompanied by social activities. In times of crisis, it is to the monks that
people bring their problems for counsel. Traditionally, a ranking monk will
deliver a sermon four times a month: when the moon waxes and wanes and the day
before the new and full moons. The laity also have a chance to learn meditation
from the monks during these times. It is also possible for a lay disciple to
become enlightened. As Bhikkhu Bodhi notes, "The Suttas and commentaries do
record a few cases of lay disciples attaining the final goal of Nirvana.
However, such disciples either attain Arahantship on the brink of death or
enter the monastic order soon after their attainment. They do not continue to
dwell at home as Arahant householders, for dwelling at home is incompatible
with the state of one who has severed all craving." Monastic orders within
Theravada. Theravada monks typically belong to a particular "nikaya", variously
referred to as monastic orders or fraternities. These different orders do not
typically develop separate doctrines, but may differ in the manner in which
they observe monastic rules. These monastic orders represent lineages of
ordination, typically tracing their origin to a particular group of monks that
established a new ordination tradition within a particular country or
geographic area. In Sri Lanka caste plays a major role in the division into
nikayas. Some Theravada Buddhist countries appoint or elect a sangharaja, or
Supreme Patriarch of the Sangha, as the highest ranking or seniormost monk in a
particular area, or from a particular nikaya. The demise of monarchies has
resulted in the suspension of these posts in some countries, but patriarchs
have continued to be appointed in Thailand. Burma and Cambodia ended the
practice of appointing a sangharaja for some time, but the position was later
restored, though in Cambodia it lapsed again. Gallery. Image:Shwedagon-Pagoda-
