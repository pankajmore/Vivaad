leadership within some religions. A clergyman, clergywoman, clergyperson,
churchman or cleric is a member of the clergy, especially one who is a priest,
preacher, pastor, or other religious professional. Clergy have different
functions in different religious traditions. They may lead certain rituals, for
example, or help in spreading religious doctrines and practices. In
Christianity, specific names and roles of clergy vary by denomonation, and
there is a wide range of formal and informal clergy positions, including
deacons, priests, bishops, preachers, pastors, and ministers. In Shia Islam, a
religious leader is often known as an imam or ayatollah. In Jewish tradition, a
religious leader is often a rabbi or hazzan (cantor). Etymology. The term
ultimately comes from the Greek "κλῆρος" - "klēros", "a lot", "that
which is assigned by lot" (allotment) or metaphorically, "inheritance". Within
Christianity, especially in Eastern Christianity and formerly in Western Roman
Catholicism, the term "cleric" refers to any individual who has received the
clerical tonsure, including deacons, priests, and bishops. In Latin Roman
Catholicism, the tonsure was a prerequisite for receiving any of the minor
orders or major orders before the tonsure, minor orders, and the subdiaconate
were abolished following the Second Vatican Council. Now, the clerical state is
tied to reception of the diaconate. Minor Orders are still given in the Eastern
Catholic Churches, and those who receive those orders are 'minor clerics.' The
use of the word "cleric" is also appropriate for Eastern Orthodox minor clergy
who are tonsured in order not to trivialise orders such as those of Reader in
the Eastern Church, or for those who are tonsured yet have no minor or major
orders. It is in this sense that the word entered the Arabic language, most
commonly in Lebanon from the French, as "kleriki" (or, alternatively,
"cleriki") meaning "seminarian." This is all in keeping with Eastern Orthodox
concepts of clergy, which still include those who have not yet received, or do
not plan to receive, the diaconate. The term clerk derives from cleric, since
in medieval times the clergy were one of the few groups who could read, and
therefore were often employed to do bookkeeping and similar work. The term
clerical work continues to this day to refer to such functions. A priesthood is
a body of priests, shamans, or oracles who have special religious authority or
function. The term priest is derived from the Greek presbyter
(πρεσβύτερος, "presbýteros", elder or senior), but is often used in
the sense of sacerdos in particular, i.e., for clergy performing ritual within
the sphere of the sacred or numinous communicating with the gods on behalf of
the community. Buddhism. Buddhist clergy are often referred to as the Sangha
and consists of the order of monks (bhikshus) and nuns (bhikshunis) founded by
Gautama Buddha during the 5th century BC, as well as lay priests in the modern
era and ngagpas of the Tibetan tradition. According to scriptural records,
these celibate monks and nuns in the time of the Buddha lived an austere life
of meditation, living as wandering beggars for nine months out of the year and
remaining in retreat during the rainy season. In modern times, however, the
role of Buddhist clergy can vary greatly across different countries. For
instance, in Japan and in some sects in Korea, monastic law regarding celibacy
has been abandoned and Buddhist clergy do not take the ordination of a monk or
nun but take alternate ordination which allows them to marry (though nuns, at
least in Japan, tend to remain unmarried). Likewise, there are some lamas
(Buddhist teachers) of the Tibetan tradition called "ngagpa," who do not
receive monastic ordination. On the other hand, countries practicing Theravada
Buddhism, such as Thailand, Burma, Cambodia and Sri Lanka, tend to take a much
more conservative view of monastic life, and continue to observe precepts that
forbid monks from touching women or working in certain secular roles. While
female monastic ("bhikkhuni") lineages existed in most Buddhist countries at
one time, the Theravada lineages of Southeast Asia died out during the 14th-
15th Century AD. Furthermore, it appears that the bhikkhuni lineage was never
transmitted to Tibet in the first place and only the novice ordination is
available to them. The status and future of female Buddhist clergy in these
countries continues to be a subject of debate. In countries without a formal
female monastic lineage, women may take other religious roles, but they are
generally not granted the same rights and privileges as recognized male
monastics. The diversity of Buddhist traditions makes it difficult to
generalize about Buddhist clergy. In the United States, Pure Land priests of
the Japanese diaspora serve a role very similar to Protestant ministers of the
Christian tradition. Meanwhile, reclusive Theravada forest monks in Thailand
live a life devoted to meditation and the practice of austerities in small
communities in rural Thailand- a very different life from even their city-
dwelling counterparts, who may be involved primarily in teaching, the study of
scripture, and the administration of the nationally organized (and government
sponsored) Sangha. In the Zen traditions of China, Korea and Japan, manual
labor is an important part of religious discipline; meanwhile, in the Theravada
tradition, prohibitions against monks working as laborers and farmers continue
to be generally observed. Currently in North America, there are both celibate
and non-celibate clergy in a variety of Buddhist traditions from around the
world. In some cases they are forest dwelling monks of the Theravada tradition
and in other cases they are married clergy of a Japanese Zen lineage and may
work a secular job in addition to their role in the Buddhist community. There
is also a growing realization that traditional training in ritual and
meditation as well as philosophy may not be sufficient to meet the needs and
expectations of American lay people. Some communities have begun exploring the
need for training in counseling skills as well. Along these lines, at least two
fully accredited Master of Divinity programs are currently available: one at
Naropa University in Boulder, CO and one at the University of the West in
Rosemead, CA. Christianity. In general, Christian clergy are ordained; that is,
they are set apart for specific ministry in religious rites. Others who have
definite roles in worship but who are not ordained (e.g. laypeople acting as
acolytes) are generally not considered clergy, even though they may require
some sort of official approval to exercise these ministries. Types of clerics
are distinguished from offices, even when the latter are commonly or
exclusively occupied by clerics. A Roman Catholic cardinal, for instance, is
almost without exception a cleric, but a cardinal is not a type of cleric. An
archbishop is not a distinct type of cleric, but is simply a bishop who
occupies a particular position with special authority. Conversely, a youth
minister at a parish may or may not be a cleric. Different churches have
different systems of clergy, though churches with similar polity have similar
systems. Anglicanism. In Anglicanism clergy consist of the orders of deacons,
priests (presbyters) and bishops in ascending order of seniority. "Canon",
"archdeacon", "archbishop" and the like are specific positions within these
orders. Bishops are typically overseers, presiding over a diocese composed of
many parishes, with an archbishops presiding over a province, which is a group
of dioceses. A parish (generally a single church) is looked after by one or
more priests, although one priest may be responsible for several parishes. New
clergy are ordained deacons. Those seeking to become priests are usually
ordained priest after a year. Since the 1960s some Anglican churches have
reinstituted the diaconate as a permanent, rather than transitional, order of
ministry focused on ministry that bridges the church and the world, especially
ministry to those on the margins of society. For the forms of address for
Anglican clergy, see Forms of address in the United Kingdom. For a short period
of history before the ordination of women as deacons, priests and bishops began
within Anglicanism they could be "deaconesses". Although they were usually
considered having a ministry distinct from deacons they often had similar
ministerial responsibilities. In Anglican churches all clergy are permitted to
marry. In most national churches women may become deacons or priests, but while
fifteen out of 38 national churches allow for women bishops, only five have
ordained any. Celebration of the Eucharist is reserved for priests and bishops.
National Anglican churches are presided over by one or more primates or
metropolitans (archbishops or presiding bishops). The senior archbishop of the
Anglican Communion is the Archbishop of Canterbury, who acts as leader of the
Church of England and 'first among equals' of the primates of all Anglican
churches. Being a deacon, priest or bishop is considered a function of the
person and not a job. When priests retire they are still priests even if they
no longer have any active ministry. However, they only hold the basic rank
after retirement. Thus a retired archbishop can only be considered a bishop
(though it is possible to refer to 'Bishop John Smith, the former Archbishop of
York'), a canon or archdeacon is a priest on retirement and does not hold any
additional honorifics. Catholicism. Ordained Catholic clergy are deacons,
priests or bishops, i.e., they belong to the diaconate, the presbyterate, or
the episcopate. Among bishops, some are metropolitans, archbishops, or
patriarchs, and the Pope is the Bishop of Rome. With rare exceptions, cardinals
are bishops, although it was not always so; formerly, some cardinals were
people who had received clerical tonsure, but not Holy Orders. The Holy See
supports the activity of its clergy by the Congregation for the Clergy ([http:/
/www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cclergy/]), a dicastery of Roman
curia. Canon Law indicates (canon 207) that "y divine institution, there are
among the Christian faithful in the Church sacred ministers who in law are also
called clerics; the other members of the Christian faithful are called lay
persons". This distinction of a separate ministry was formed in the early times
of Christianity; one early source reflecting this distinction, with the three
ranks or orders of bishop, priest and deacon, is the writings of Saint Ignatius
of Antioch. Holy Orders is one of the Seven Sacraments that Catholic doctrine
considers to be of divine institution. In the Catholic Church, only men can be
clerics. In the Latin Church before 1972, tonsure admitted someone to the
clerical state, after which he could receive the four minor orders (ostiary,
lectorate, order of exorcists, order of acolytes) and then the major orders of
subdiaconate, diaconate, presbyterate, and finally the episcopate, which
Catholic doctrine sees as "the fullness of Holy Orders". Since 1972 the minor
orders and the subdiaconate have been replaced by lay ministries and clerical
tonsure no longer takes place, except in some Traditionalist Catholic groups,
and the clerical state is acquired, even in those groups, by Holy Orders. In
the Latin Church the initial level of the three ranks of Holy Orders is that of
the diaconate. In addition to these three orders of clerics, some eastern
Catholic Churches have what are called "minor clerics". Members of institutes
of consecrated life and societies of apostolic life are clerics only if they
have received Holy Orders. Thus, unordained monks, friars, nuns, and religious
brothers and sisters are not part of the clergy. The Code of Canon Law and the
Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches prescribe that every cleric must be
enrolled or "incardinated" in a diocese or its equivalent (an apostolic
vicariate, territorial abbey, personal prelature, etc.) or in a religious
institute, society of apostolic life or secular institute. The need for this
requirement arose because of the trouble caused from the earliest years of the
Church by unattached or vagrant clergy subject to no ecclesiastical authority
and often causing scandal wherever they went. Current canon law prescribes that
to be ordained a priest, an education is required of two years of philosophy
and four of theology, including study of dogmatic and moral theology, the Holy
Scriptures, and canon law have to be studied within a seminary or an
ecclesiastical faculty at a university. Within the Catholic Church, clerical
celibacy is mandated for all clergy in the Latin Church except deacons who do
not intend to become priests. Exceptions are sometimes admitted for ordination
to transitional diaconate and priesthood on a case-by-case basis for married
clergymen of other churches or communities who become Catholics, but ordination
of married men to the episcopacy is excluded (see Personal ordinariate).
Clerical marriage is not allowed and therefore, if those for whom in some
particular Church celibacy is optional (such as permanent deacons in the Latin
Church) wish to marry, they must do so before ordination. Eastern Catholic
Churches either follow the same rules as the Latin Church or require celibacy
only for bishops. Latter-day Saints. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints (Mormons) has no dedicated clergy, and is governed instead by unpaid
local priesthood holders and paid general authorities. No formal theological
training is required. All clergy members are called by revelation and the
laying on of hands by one who holds authority. Jesus Christ stands at the head
of the church and leads the church through revelation given to a living prophet
and Twelve Apostles. The Prophet and Apostles lead over the quorums of the
seventy which are assigned geographically over several "stakes" within the
church. Each stake has a stake president who has two counselors and a high
council which preside over the stake. The stake is made up of several
congregations, which are called "wards" or "branches." Individual congregations
("wards") are led by a Bishop or branch president who was called to his
position through revelation by the church's hierarchical leadership, and he
serves until released from the position. Generally, all worthy males at (or
above) the age of 12 are ordained to the Aaronic Priesthood as deacons,
teachers or priests, authorizing them to perform certain ordinances and
sacraments, and adult males are ordained to the Melchizedek Priesthood, as
elders, seventies, or high priests in that priesthood, which is concerned with
spiritual leadership of the church. Although the term "clergy" is not typically
used in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, it would most
appropriately apply to ward bishops and stake presidents. Merely holding an
office in the priesthood does not imply authority over other church members or
agency to act on behalf of the church. Orthodoxy. The Orthodox Church has three
ranks of holy orders: bishop, priest, and deacon. These are the same offices
identified in the New Testament and found in the Early Church, as testified by
the writings of the Holy Fathers. Each of these ranks is ordained through the
Sacred Mystery (sacrament) of the laying on of hands (called "Cheirotonia") by
bishops. Priests and deacons are ordained by their own diocesan bishop, while
bishops are consecrated through the laying on of hands of at least three other
bishops. Within each of these three ranks there are found a number of titles.
Bishops may have the title of archbishop, metropolitan, and patriarch, all of
which are considered honorifics. Among the Orthodox, all bishops are considered
equal, though an individual may have a place of higher or lower honor, and each
has his place within the order of precedence. Priests (also called presbyters)
may (or may not) have the title of archpriest, protopresbyter (also called
"protopriest", or "protopope"), hieromonk (a monk who has been ordained to the
priesthood) archimandrite (a senior hieromonk) and Hegumen (abbot). Deacons may
have the title of hierodeacon (a monk who has been ordained to the deaconate),
archdeacon or protodeacon. The lower clergy are not ordained through
"Cheirotonia" (laying on of hands) but through a blessing known as
"Cheirothesia" (setting-aside). These clerical ranks are subdeacon, reader and
altar server (also known as taper-bearer). Some churches have a separate
service for the blessing of a cantor. Ordination of a bishop, priest, deacon or
subdeacon must be conferred during the Divine Liturgy (Eucharist)—though in
some churches it is permitted to ordain up through deacon during the Liturgy of
the Presanctified Gifts—and no more than a single individual can be ordained
to the same rank in any one service. Numerous members of the lower clergy may
be ordained at the same service, and their blessing usually takes place during
the Little Hours prior to Liturgy, or may take place as a separate service. The
blessing of readers and taper-bearers is usually combined into a single
service. Subdeacons are ordained during the Little Hours, but the ceremonies
surrounding his blessing continue through the Divine Liturgy, specifically
during the Great Entrance. Bishops are usually drawn from the ranks of the
archimandrites, and are required to be celibate; however, a non-monastic priest
may be ordained to the episcopate if he no longer lives with his wife
(following Canon XII of the Quinisext Council) In contemporary usage such a
non-monastic priest is usually tonsured to the monastic state, and then
elevated to archimandrite, at some point prior to his consecration to the
episcopacy. Although not a formal or canonical prerequisite, nowadays bishops
are normally required to have attained a University degree, usually but not
necessarily in theology. Usual titles are "Your Holiness" for a patriarch (with
"Your All-Holiness" for the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople), "Your
Beatitude" for an archbishop in charge of an autocephalous church, "Your
Eminence" for an archbishop, "Master" or "Your Grace" for a bishop and "Father"
for priests, deacons and monks though there are variations between the various
Orthodox Churches. Orthodox priests, deacons, and subdeacons must be either
married or celibate (preferably monastic) prior to ordination, but may not
marry after ordination. "Re"marriage of clergy following divorce or widowhood
is forbidden. Married clergy are considered as best-suited to staff parishes,
as a priest with a family is thought better qualified to counsel his flock.
Protestantism. Clergy in Protestantism fill a wide variety of roles and
functions. In many denominations, such as Methodism, Presbyterianism, and
Lutheranism, the roles of clergy are similar to Roman Catholic or Anglican
clergy, in that they hold an ordained pastoral or priestly office, administer
the sacraments, proclaim the word, lead a local church or parish, and so forth.
The Baptist tradition only recognizes two ordained positions in the church as
being the elders (pastors) and deacons as outlined in the third chapter of I
Timothy in the Bible. The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) ordains two types of
presbyters or elders, teaching (pastor) and ruling (leaders of the congregation
which form a council with the pastors). Teaching elders are seminary trained
and ordained as a presbyter and set aside on behalf of the whole denomination
to the ministry of Word and Sacrament. Ordinarily, teaching elders are
installed by a presbytery as pastor of a congregation. Ruling elders, after
receiving training, may be commissioned by a presbytery to serve as a pastor of
a congregation, as well as preach and administer sacraments. The process of
being designated as a member of the Protestant clergy, as well as that of being
assigned to a particular office, varies with the denomination or faith group.
Some Protestant denominations, such as Methodism, Presbyterianism, and
Lutheranism, are hierarchical in nature; and ordination and assignment to
individual pastorates or other ministries are made by the parent denominations.
In other traditions, such as the Baptist and other Congregational groups, local
churches are free to hire (and often ordain) their own clergy, although the
parent denominations typically maintain lists of suitable candidates seeking
appointment to local church ministries and encourage local churches to consider
these individuals when filling available positions. Some Protestant
denominations require that candidates for ordination be "licensed" to the
ministry for a period of time (typically one to three years) prior to being
ordained. This period typically is spent performing the duties of ministry
under the guidance, supervision, and evaluation of a more senior, ordained
minister. In some denominations, however, licensure is a permanent, rather than
a transitional state for ministers assigned to certain specialized ministries,
such as music ministry or youth ministry. Many Protestant denominations reject
the idea that the clergy are a separate category of people, but rather stress
the "priesthood of all believers". Based on this theological approach, most
Protestants do not have a sacrament of ordination like the pre-Reformation
churches. Protestant ordination, therefore, can be viewed more as a public
statement by the ordaining body that an individual possesses the theological
knowledge, moral fitness, and practical skills required for service in that
faith group's ministry. Some Lutheran churches form an exception to this rule,
as the Lutheran Book of Concord allows ordination to be received as a
sacrament. Some Protestant denominations dislike the word "clergy" and do not
use it of their own leaders. Often they refer to their leaders as pastors or
ministers, titles that, if used, sometimes apply to the person only as long as
he or she holds a particular office File:Philippus Rovenius.jpg|The Very

Assistant Vicar at Stockholm Cathedral  Islam. Islam, like Judaism, has no
clergy in the sacerdotal sense. The title "mullah" (a Persian corruption of the
Arabic "maula", "master"), commonly translated "cleric" in the West and thought
to be analogous to "priest" or "rabbi", is a title of address for any educated
or respected figure, not even necessarily (though frequently) religious. The
title "shaikh" ("elder") is used similarly. The nearest Islamic analogue to the
parish priest or pastor, or to the "pulpit rabbi" of a synagogue, is called
under Sunni Islam the "imam khatib." This compound title is merely a common
combination of two elementary offices: leader "(imam)" of the congregational
prayer, which in larger mosques is performed at the times of all daily prayers;
and preacher "(khatib)" of the sermon or "khutba" at the required
congregational prayer on Friday. Although either duty can be performed by
anyone who is regarded as qualified by the congregation, at most well-
established mosques "imam khatib" is a permanent (part-time or full-time)
position. He may be elected by the local community, or appointed by an outside
authority -- "e. g.," the national government, or the waqf which sustains the
mosque. There is no ordination as such; the only requirement for appointment as
an "imam khatib" is recognition as someone of sufficient learning and virtue to
perform both duties on a regular basis, and to instruct the congregation in the
basics of Islam. An imam has no religiousauthority, higher or special position
in religious sense. Their opinions might be found valuable to their
congregetion because of their knowledge on religious matters, but an imam's
view of a religious matter is in no sense binding, infallible or absolute like
the Catholic Church. The title "hafiz" (lit. "preserver") is awarded to one who
has memorized the entire Qur'an, often by attending a special course for the
purpose; the "imam khatib" of a mosque is frequently (though not always) a
"hafiz." The title "`alim" (pl. "`ulamah"), or "scholar", denotes someone who
is engaged in advanced study of the traditional Islamic sciences "(`ulum)" at
an Islamic university or "madrasah jami`ah". In modern Shi`ah Islam, scholars
play a more prominent role in the daily lives of Muslims than in Sunni Islam;
and there is a hierarchy of higher titles of scholastic authority, such as
"Ayatollah". Since around the mid-19th century, a more complex title has been
used in Twelver Shi'ism, namely Marja' al-taqlid. A marja' is a source and
taqlid is a form of religious obedience or imitation. Lay Shi'is must identify
a specific marja' whom they emulate, according to his rulings (fatwas) or other
writings. On several occasions, the marja'iyyat has been limited to a single
individual, in which case his rulings have been applicable to all those living
in the Twelver Shi'i world. Of broader importance has been the role of the
mujtahid, a cleric of superior knowledge. Mujtahids are few in number, but it
is from their ranks that the Maraji' al-taqlid are drawn. There are several
specialist offices pertaining to the study and administration of Islamic law or
"shari`ah." A scholar with a specialty in "fiqh" or jurisprudence is known as a
"faqih". A "qadi" is a judge in an Islamic court. A "mufti" is a scholar who
has completed an advanced course of study which qualifies him to issue judicial
opinions or "fatawah". But again they are merely law professors, judges and
lawyers; not priests. The pastoral care function of the Christian clergy such
as a Catholic priest or Protestant pastor is fulfilled for many Muslims by a
"murshid" ("guide"), master of the spiritual sciences and disciplines known as
"tasawuf" or Sufism. Sufi guides are commonly titled "Shaikh" ("Elder") in both
speaking and writing; in North Africa they are sometimes called marabouts. They
are traditionally appointed by their predecessors, in an unbroken teaching
lineage reaching back to Muhammad himself. This lineal succession of Sufi
guides is the nearest approach within Islam to the concept of Christian
ordination and apostolic succession, but the similarity is superficial and a
murshid is not a priest but merely a teacher of Sufi philosophy; they do not
have any special or higher position than any other Muslim. An aspiring Sufi
pledges himself (or herself) to a "murshid" by taking a vow of obedience, or
"bai'ah." The aspirant is then known as a "murid" ("disciple" or "follower"). A
"murid" who takes on special disciplines under the guide's instruction, ranging
from an intensive spiritual retreat to voluntary poverty and homelessness, is
sometimes known as a dervish. During the Islamic Golden Age, it was common for
scholars to attain recognized mastery of both the "exterior sciences" "(`ulum
az-zahir)" of the madrasahs, and the "interior sciences" "(`ulum al-batin)" of
Sufism. Al-Ghazali and Rumi are two notable examples. Judaism. Judaism does not
have clergy as such, although according to the Torah there is a tribe of
priests known as the Kohanim who were leaders of the religion up to the
destruction of the Temple of Jerusalem in 70AD when most Sadducees were wiped
out; each member of the tribe, a Kohen had priestly duties, many of which
centered around the sacrificial duties, atonement and blessings of the
Israelite nation. Today, Jewish Kohanim know their status by family tradition
and DNA, and still offer the priestly blessing during certain services in the
synagogue and perform the Pidyon Ha-ben (redemption of the first-born son)
ceremony. Since the time of the destruction of the Temple of Jerusalem, the
religious leaders of Judaism have often been rabbis, who are technically
scholars in Jewish law empowered to act as judges in a rabbinical court. All
types of Judaism except Orthodox Judaism allow women as well as men to be
ordained as rabbis and cantors [http://www.myjewishlearning.com/practices/
Ritual/Prayer/Synagogue_and_Religious_Leaders/What_is_a_Cantor.shtml. The
leadership of a Jewish congregation is, in fact, in the hands of the laity: the
president of a synagogue is its actual leader and any adult Jew (or at least
any male adult Jew in Orthodox congregations) can lead prayer services. Rabbis
are not intermediaries between God and humans: the word "rabbi" means
"teacher", and the rabbi functions as advisor to the congregation and
counselor. The rabbi is not an occupation found in the Torah (Five books of
Moses); the first time this word is mentioned is in the Mishnah. The modern
form of the rabbi developed in the Talmudic era. Rabbis are given authority to
make interpretations of Jewish law and custom. Traditionally, a man obtains one
of three levels of Semicha (rabbinic ordination) after the completion of an
arduous learning program in Torah, Tanakh (Hebrew Bible), Mishnah and Talmud,
Midrash, Jewish ethics and lore, the codes of Jewish law and responsa, theology
and philosophy. Since the early medieval era an additional communal role, the
"Hazzan" (cantor) has existed as well. Cantors have sometimes been the only
functionaries of a synagogue, empowered to undertake religio-civil functions
like witnessing marriages. Cantors do provide leadership of actual services,
primarily because of their training and expertise in the music and prayer
rituals pertaining to them, rather than because of any spiritual or
"sacramental" distinction between them and the laity. Cantors as much as rabbis
have been recognized by civil authorities in the United States as clergy for
legal purposes, mostly for awarding education degrees and their ability to
perform weddings, and certify births and deaths. Additionally, Jewish
authorities license "mohels", people specially trained by experts in Jewish law
and usually also by medical professionals to perform the ritual of circumcision
[http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/28632/making-the-cut/]. All types of
Judaism except Orthodox Judaism license women as mohels, called "mohelot" (pl.
of "mohelet," f. of mohel) As the Jewish News Weekly of Northern California
states, "...there is no halachic prescription against female mohels, [but none
exist in the Orthodox world, where the preference is that the task be
undertaken by a Jewish man." [http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/28632/making-
the-cut/]. In many places, mohels are also licensed by civil authorities, as
circumcision is technically a surgical procedure. Kohanim, who must avoid
contact with dead human body parts (such as the removed foreskin) for ritual
purity, cannot act as mohels, but some mohels are also either rabbis or
cantors. Another licensed cleric in Judaism is the "shochet", who are trained
and licensed by religious authorities for kosher slaughter according to ritual
law. A Kohen may be a shochet. Most shochetim are ordained rabbis. Orthodox
Judaism. In contemporary Orthodox Judaism, women are forbidden from becoming
rabbis or cantors in the Orthodox world primarily because this would affect
many aspects of communal observances and practices. Most Orthodox rabbinical
seminaries or yeshivas also require dedication of many years to education, but
few require a formal degree from a civil education institutions that often
define Christian clergy. Training is often focused on Jewish law, and some
Orthodox Yeshivas forbid secular education. In Hasidic Judaism, generally
understood as a branch of Orthodox Judaism, there are dynastic spiritual
leaders known as "Rebbes", often translated in English as "Grand Rabbi". The
office of Rebbe is generally a hereditary one, may also be passed from Rebbe to
student, or recognized by a congregation conferring a sort of coronation to
their new Rebbe. Although one does not need to be an ordained Rabbi to be a
Rebbe, most Rebbes today are ordained Rabbis. Since one does not need to be an
ordained Rabbi to be a Rebbe, some points in history there were female Rebbes
as well, particularly the Maiden of Ludmir. Conservative Judaism. In
Conservative Judaism, both men and women are ordained as rabbis and cantors.
Conservative Judaism differs with Orthodoxy in that it sees Jewish Law as
binding but also as subject to many interpretations, including more liberal
interpretations. Academic requirements for becoming a rabbi are rigorous. First
earn a bachelor's degree before entering rabbinical school. Studies are
mandated in pastoral care and psychology, the historical development of Judaism
and most importantly the academic study of Bible, Talmud and Rabbinic
Literature, Philosophy and Theology, Liturgy, Jewish History, and Hebrew
Literature of all periods. Reconstructionist and Reform Judaism.
Reconstructionist Judaism and Reform Judaism do not maintain the traditional
requirements for study as rooted in Jewish Law and traditionalist text. Both
men and women may be rabbis or cantors. The level of Jewish law, Talmud and
responsa studied in five years of these denominations is similar to that
learned in the first year of the more traditional Jewish seminaries. The
rabbinical seminaries of these movements hold that one must first earn a
bachelor's degree before entering the rabbinate. In addition studies are
mandated in pastoral care and psychology, the historical development of
Judaism; and academic biblical criticism. Emphasis is placed not on Jewish law,
but rather on sociology, modern Jewish philosophy, Theology and Pastoral Care.
Sikhism. Sikhism strongly recognizes the Guru of Sikhism as its Supreme
Authority on Earth. But in events of a need of a more of physical authority
then the five Jathedars of the five holy Takhts are to be approached. As they
are considered as the Supreme Temporal authority of Sikhism. Traditional
religions. Historically traditional (or "pagan") religions typically combine
religious authority and political power. What this means is that the sacred
king or queen is therefore seen to combine both kingship and priesthood within
his or her person, even though he or she is often aided by an actual high
priest or priestess (see, for example, the Maya priesthood). When the functions
of political ruler and religious leader are combined in this way, deification
could be seen to be the next logical stage of his or her social advancement
within his or her native environment, as is found in the case of the Egyptian
Pharaohs. The Vedic priesthood of India is an early instance of a structured
body of clergy organized as a separate and hereditary caste, one that occupied
the highest social rung of its nation. A modern example of this phenomenon,
meanwhile, is that of the priestly monarchs of the Yoruba holy city of Ile-Ife

reigning Onis of the realm for the sustenance of the entire planet and its
people. Health risks. In recent years findings have arisen that clergy are more
at risk than the general population for obesity, hypertension and depression.
Life expectancies for clergy have fallen in recent years. In the last decade
the use of antidepressants by clergy has risen. It is not clearly known why
these deteriorating qualities of life are now applying to members of the
clergy. A likely explanation is a lack of time off from the job. Cell phones
and e-mail combined with a sense of responsibility to both God and humanity are
likely contributing factors.
