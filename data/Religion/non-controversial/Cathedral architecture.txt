Architecture of cathedrals and great churches The architecture of cathedrals,
basilicas and abbey churches is characterised by the buildings' large scale and
follows one of several branching traditions of form, function and style that
stem initially from Early Christian architectural traditions of the Roman
Empire. Cathedrals in particular, as well as many abbey churches and basilicas,
have certain complex structural forms that are found less often in parish
churches. They also tend to display a higher level of contemporary
architectural style and the work of accomplished craftsmen, and occupy a status
both ecclesiastical and social that an ordinary parish church does not have.
Such a cathedral or great church is generally one of the finest buildings
within its region and is a focus of local pride. Many cathedrals and basilicas,
and a number of abbey churches are among the most renowned works of
architecture on the planet. These include St. Peter‚Äôs Basilica, Notre Dame de
Paris, Cologne Cathedral, Salisbury Cathedral, Prague Cathedral, Lincoln
Cathedral, the Basilica of St Denis, the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore, the
Basilica of San Vitale, St Mark's Basilica, Westminster Abbey, Saint Basil's
Cathedral, Washington National Cathedral, Gaud√≠'s incomplete Sagrada Familia
and the ancient church of Hagia Sophia, now a museum. The earliest large
churches date from the Roman Empire. As Christianity and the construction of
churches and cathedrals spread throughout the world, their manner of building
was dependent upon local materials and local techniques. Different styles of
architecture developed and their fashion spread, carried by the establishment
of monastic orders, by the posting of bishops from one region to another and by
the travelling of master stonemasons who served as architects. The styles of
the great church buildings are successively known as Early Christian,
Byzantine, Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque, various Revival styles of
the late 18th to early 20th centuries and Modern. Overlaid on each of the
academic styles are the regional characteristics. Some of these characteristics
are so typical of a particular country or region that they appear, regardless
of style, in the architecture of churches designed many centuries apart.
Function. Among the world's largest and most architecturally significant
churches, many were built to serve as cathedrals or abbey churches. Among the
Roman Catholic churches, many have been raised to the status of "basilica". The
categories below are not exclusive. A church can be an abbey, serve as a
cathedral, and also be a basilica. Among the great Protestant churches, some,
such as Ulm Minster have never served as any of these. Others, such as
Westminster Abbey, are former abbeys and cathedrals. Orthodox and Protestant
churches do not have designated basilicas, and the term "cathedral" may or may
not be used to designate a bishop's principal church. Some significant churches
are termed "temples" or "oratories". Cathedral. Among these types of buildings
the cathedral is probably the best known, to the extent that the word
‚Äúcathedral‚Äù is sometimes mistakenly applied as a generic term for any very
large and imposing church. In fact, a cathedral does not have to be large or
imposing, although many cathedrals are. The cathedral takes its name from the
word "cathedra", or "bishop's throne" (in Latin: "ecclesia cathedralis"). A
cathedral has a specific ecclesiatical role and administrative purpose as the
seat of a bishop. The role of bishop as administrator of local clergy came into
being in the 1st century. It was two hundred years before the first cathedral
building was constructed in Rome. With the legalising of Christianity in 313 by
the Emperor Constantine I, churches were built rapidly. Five very large
churches were founded in Rome and, though much altered or rebuilt, still exist
today, including the Cathedral of Rome which is San Giovanni in Laterano and
also the better-known St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican. The architectural
form which cathedrals took was largely dependent upon their ritual function as
the seat of a bishop. Cathedrals are places where, in common with other
Christian churches, the Eucharist is celebrated, the Bible is read, the Order
of Service is said or sung, prayers are offered and sermons are preached. But
in a cathedral, in general, these things are done with a greater amount of
elaboration, pageantry and procession than in lesser churches. This elaboration
is particularly present during important liturgical rites performed by a
Bishop, such as Confirmation and Ordination. A cathedral is often the site of
rituals associated with local or national Government, the Bishops performing
the tasks of all sorts from the induction of a mayor to the coronation of a
monarch. Some of these tasks are apparent in the form and fittings of
particular cathedrals. The church that has the function of cathedral is not
always a large building. It might be as small as Christ Church Cathedral,
Oxford. But frequently, the cathedral, along with some of the abbey churches,
was the largest building in any region. Basilica. The term basilica, when
applied to a church, may be used in two ways. In architectural parlance, it
signifies a building that has similarities to the basilica structures of
Ancient Rome, being of longitudinal rather than central plan, having a central
nave with an aisle on either side separated by a colonnade, and an apse at one
end. In the ecclesiastical sense, a basilica is a church that has been
designated as such by the pope, and has accordingly received certain
privileges. A building that is designated as a basilica might be a cathedral,
an abbey, a shrine or a parish church. The four so-called "Major Basilicas" are
four churches of Rome of 4th century foundation, St. Peter's Basilica, the
Basilica of St. John Lateran, the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore and the
Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls. There are more than 1,500 churches in
the world which are designated as ‚ÄúMinor Basilicas‚Äù. The reason for such a
designation is often that the church is a pilgimage site and contains the
relics of a saint, or an object of religious veneration, such as a fragment of
the True Cross. These churches are often large and of considerable
architectural significance. They include the Basilica of St. Francis, Assisi;
the Church of the Nativity, Bethlehem; the Basilica of Our Lady of F√°tima,
Portugal; the Basilica of Our Lady of Sheshan, Shanghai and the Basilica of Our
Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico City. Abbey. An abbey church is one that is, or was
in the past, the church of a monastic order. Likewise a friary church is the
church of an order of friars. These orders include Benedictines, Cistercians,
Augustinians, Franciscans, Dominicans, Jesuits and many more. Many churches of
abbey foundation, are or previously were, part of a monastic complex that
includes dormitories, refectory, cloisters, library, chapter house and other
such buildings. In many parts of the world, abbey churches frequently served
the local community as well as the monastic community. In regions such as
England where the monastic communities were dissolved, the abbey churches,
where located in a town, have continued to serve as a parish church. In many
areas of Asia and South America, the abbeys are the earliest established
churches, with the monastic communities acting initially as missionaries to the
local people. Well-known abbey churches include Santa Maria della Grazie in
Milan, Italy; Westminster Abbey and Beverley Minster in England, the Abbaye aux
Hommes and Abbey of St. Denis in France, Melk Abbey in Austria, Great Lavra on
Mt Athos in Greece and Malate Church in Manila, Philippines. Origins and
development of the church building. From house church to church. From the first
to the early fourth centuries most Christian communities worshipped in private
homes, often secretly. Some Roman churches, such as the Basilica of San
Clemente in Rome, are built directly over the houses where early Christians
worshipped. Other early Roman churches are built on the sites of Christian
martyrdom or at the entrance to catacombs where Christians were buried. The
first very large Christian churches were built in Rome and have their origins
in the early 4th century, when the Emperor Constantine first legalised
Christianity. Several of Rome's largest churches, notably Santa Maria Maggiore
and San Giovanni in Laterano, have their foundation in the 4th century. It is
San Giovanni (St John's) and not the more famous St. Peter's Basilica which is
the cathedral church of Rome. St Peter's is also of 4th century foundation,
though nothing of that appears above the ground. Atrium. When Early Christian
Communities began to build churches they drew on one particular feature of the
houses that preceded them, the "atrium", or courtyard with a colonnade
surrounding it. Most of these atriums have disappeared. A fine example remains
at the Basilica of San Clemente in Rome and another was built in the Romanesque
period at Sant'Ambrogio, Milan. The descendants of these "atria" may be seen in
the large square cloisters that can be found beside many cathedrals, and in the
huge colonnaded squares or piazze at the Basilicas of St Peter's in Rome and St
Mark's in Venice and the Camposanto (Holy Field) at the Cathedral of Pisa.
Basilica. Early church architecture did not draw its form from Roman temples,
as the latter did not have large internal spaces where worshipping
congregations could meet. It was the Roman basilica, used for meetings, markets
and courts of law that provided a model for the large Christian church and that
gave its name to the Christian basilica. Both Roman basilicas and Roman bath
houses had at their core a large vaulted building with a high roof, braced on
either side by a series of lower chambers or a wide arcaded passage. An
important feature of the Roman basilica was that at either end it had a
projecting exedra, or apse, a semicircular space roofed with a half-dome. This
was where the magistrates sat to hold court. It passed into the church
architecture of the Roman world and was adapted in different ways as a feature
of cathedral architecture. The earliest large churches, such as the Cathedral
of San Giovanni in Laterano in Rome, consisted of a single-ended basilica with
one aspidal end and a courtyard, or "atrium", at the other end. As Christian
liturgy developed, processions became part of the proceedings. The processional
door was that which led from the furthest end of the building, while the door
most used by the public might be that central to one side of the building, as
in a basilica of law. This is the case in many cathedrals and churches. Bema.
As numbers of clergy increased, the small apse which contained the altar, or
table upon which the sacramental bread and wine were offered in the rite of
Holy Communion, was not sufficient to accommodate them. A raised dais called a"
bema" formed part of many large basilican churches. In the case of St. Peter's
Basilica and San Paolo fuori le Mura (St Paul's outside the Walls) in Rome,
this bema extended laterally beyond the main meeting hall, forming two arms so
that the building took on the shape of a T with a projecting apse. From this
beginning, the plan of the church developed into the so-called Latin Cross
which is the shape of most Western Cathedrals and large churches. The arms of
the cross are called the transept. Mausoleum. One of the influences on church
architecture was the mausoleum. The mausoleum of a noble Roman was a square or
circular domed structure which housed a sarcophagus. The Emperor Constantine
built for his daughter Costanza a mausoleum which has a circular central space
surrounded by a lower ambulatory or passageway separated by a colonnade. Santa
Costanza's burial place became a place of worship as well as a tomb. It is one
of the earliest church buildings that was centrally, rather than longitudinally
planned. Constantine was also responsible for the building of the circular,
mausoleum-like Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, which in turn
influenced the plan of a number of buildings, including that constructed in
Rome to house the remains of the proto-martyr Stephen, San Stefano Rotondo and
the Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna. Ancient circular or polygonal churches
are comparatively rare. A small number, such as the Temple Church, London were
built during the Crusades in imitation of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre as
isolated examples in England, France and Spain. In Denmark such churches in the
Romanesque style are much more numerous. In parts of Eastern Europe there are
also round tower-like churches of the Romanesque period but they are generally
vernacular architecture and of small scale. Others, like St Martin's Rotunda at
Vishegrad, in the Czech Republic, are finely detailed. The circular or
polygonal form lent itself to those buildings within church complexes that
perform a function in which it is desirable for people to stand, or sit around,
with a centralised focus, rather than an axial one. In Italy the circular or
polygonal form was used throughout the medieval period for baptisteries, while
in England it was adapted for chapter houses. In France the aisled polygonal
plan was adapted as the eastern terminal and in Spain the same form is often
used as a chapel. Other than Santa Costanza and San Stefano, there was another
significant place of worship in Rome that was also circular, the vast Ancient
Roman Pantheon, with its numerous statue-filled niches. This too was to become
a Christian church and lend its style to the development of Cathedral
architecture. Latin Cross and Greek Cross. Most cathedrals and great churches
have a cruciform groundplan. In churches of Western European tradition, the
plan is usually longitudinal, in the form of the so-called Latin Cross with a
long nave crossed by a transept. The transept may be as strongly projecting as
at York Minster or not project beyond the aisles as at Amiens Cathedral. Many
of the earliest churches of Byzantium have a longitudinal plan. At Hagia
Sophia, Istanbul, there is a central dome, frame on one axis by two high semi-
domes and on the other by low rectangular transept arms, the overall plan being
square. This large church was to influence the building of many later churches,
even into the 21st century. A square plan in which the nave, chancel and
transept arms are of equal length forming a Greek cross, the crossing generally
surmounted by a dome became the common form in the Orthodox Church, with many
churches throughout Eastern Europe and Russia being built in this way. Churches
of the Greek Cross form often have a narthex or vestibule which stretches
across the front of the church. This type of plan was also to later play a part
in the development of church architecture in Western Europe, most notably in
Bramante's plan for St. Peter's Basilica. Architectural forms common to many
cathedrals and great churches. Note- Because of the diversity in the individual
building histories, this list is a generalised one and not all the
characteristics pertain to every building. This list is compiled from Banister
Fletcher. Axis. As described above, the majority of cathedrals and great
churches are cruciform in shape with the church having a defined axis. The axis
is generally east/west with external emphasis upon the west front, normally the
main entrance, and internal emphasis upon the eastern end so that the
congregation faces the direction of the coming of Christ. Because it is also
the direction of the rising sun, the architectural features of the east end
often focus on enhancing interior illumination by the sun. Not every church or
cathedral maintains a strict east/west axis, but even in those that do not, the
terms East End and West Front are used. Many churches of Rome, notably St
Peter's Basilica, face the opposite direction. Nave. The majority of cathedrals
and large churches of the Western European tradition have a high wide nave with
a lower aisle separated by an arcade on either side. Occasionally the aisles
are as high as the nave, forming a hall church. Many cathedrals have two aisles
on either side. Notre Dame de Paris has two aisles and a row of chapels. In the
case of a centrally planned church, the major axis is that between the main
door and the altar. Transept. The transept forms the arms of the church
building. In English cathedrals of monastic foundation there are often two
transepts. The intersection where the nave and transept meet is called the
crossing and is often surmounted by a small spire called a "fl√®che", a dome
or, particularly in England, a large tower with or without a spire. Vertical
emphasis. There is generally a prominent external feature that rises upwards.
It may be a dome, a central tower, two western towers or towers at both ends as
at Speyer Cathedral. The towers may be finished with pinnacles or spires or a
small dome. Fa√ßade. The fa√ßade or "west front" is the most ornate part of the
exterior with the processional doors, often three in number, and often richly
decorated with sculpture, marble or stone tracery. The fa√ßade often has a
large window, sometimes a rose window or an impressive sculptural group as its
central feature. In the Western European tradition, there are frequently paired
towers framing the fa√ßade. These towers have their origin in a tradition
practised at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. During Holy Week
the faithful would process along the Way of the Cross, leading to the Basilica,
which in Early Christian times consisted of a domed shrine over the site of the
tomb, and a "porch" which had a staircase on either side, supported by a small
tower, by which the procession entered and exitted. These towers were adopted
symbolically, particularly in Romanesque architecture, as corner turrets and
flourished in Norman and Gothic architecture as large towers, reaching their
height of magnificence at Cologne Cathedral, where they were not completed
until the late 19th century. East end. The east end is the part of the building
which shows the greatest diversity of architectural form. At the eastern end,
internally, lies the sanctuary where the altar of the cathedral is located.
External Decoration. The external decoration of a cathedral or large church
building is often both architectural and pictorial. Decorative architectural
devices include columns, pilasters, arcading, cornices, moldings, finials and
tracery. The forms taken by these features is one of the clearest indications
of the style and date of any particular building. Pictorial elements may
include sculpture, painting and mosaic. Sculpture is the predominant pictorial
decorative element in most regions where buildings are of stone construction.
In the great medieval churches of France, Spain, England and much of Germany,
figurative sculpture is found adorning fa√ßades and portals. Churches of brick,
such as those of much of Italy, are often adorned with mosaics, inlays, inset
marble friezes and free-standing statues at the roofline. Mosaics were a
particular feature of Byzantine architecture and are the main form of adornment
of many Orthodox churches, both externally and internally. The most common
theme in the decoration, both external and internal, of any church, is the
salvation of humankind by Jesus Christ. The decorative scheme often functions
as a Poor Man's Bible, warning the church-goer that, in Biblical terms, the
just rewards for his sinful nature is death, and that only through Jesus can
forgiveness and redemption be gained. The scheme typically starts outside the
church, on the west front, with the portrayal of Christ the Judge above the
lintel of the main door. In Romanesque and Gothic buildings, this is usually a
sculptural group, and may entail a whole scene of the Last Judgement with
details of souls being weighed and rewarded, or dragged down to Hell by demons.
In those churches in which painted rather than sculptured decoration prevails,
the "Last Judgement" is often located on the interior of the west end, rather
than the interior. Section references:Banister Fletcher, Wim Swaan, Larousse.
Internal features. Nave and aisles. The main body of the building, making the
longer arm of the cross, where worshippers congregate, is called the nave. The
term is from the Latin word for ship. A cathedral is symbolically a ship
bearing the people of God through the storms of life. In addition, the high
wooden roof of a large church is similarly constructed to the hull of a ship.
The nave is braced on either side by lower aisles, separated from the main
space by a row of piers or columns. The aisles facilitate the movement of
people, even when the nave is full of worshippers. They also strengthen the
structure by buttressing the inner walls that carry the high roof, which in the
case of many cathedrals and other large churches, is made of stone. Above the
roof of the aisle are the clerestory windows which light the nave. In some
large churches, particularly late Medieval churches, there are two aisles on
either side of nave. Other churches have a single aisle and a row of chapels on
either sde. In some churches, particularly in Germany, the aisles are almost as
high as the nave, forming a "hall church". In this case, because there is no
clerestory, the aisle windows are often very tall, to admit light to the nave.
Crossing and transept. The crossing is the point in a large church at which the
transept intersects the nave. This point is often marked externally by a tower
or dome and internally by the piers and arches that are required to bear the
weight of such a structure. The interior of the dome or tower may be one of the
major architectural features of the interior of the church. In a centrally
planned church such as Hagia Sophia, and typical of many Orthodox churches, the
major interior space of the building is roofed by the dome. The transept is
symbolic of the arms of the Cross, but also provide space for congregation and
for additional chapels. Transept chapels are often dedicated to a particular
saint, or to a particular aspect in the life and ministry of Christ, such as
the Nativity or the Resurrection. In some English cathedrals there is often a
second transept containing chapels, to facilitate the saying of the Holy Office
by clergy each day. Choir and presbytery. In a church in which part of the body
of the church extends beyond the transept, then this extension is
architecturally termed the "choir". This architectural form is common in Norman
and Gothic architecture. The choir, where it exists, normally contains the
choir stalls, and the "sanctuary" and the "cathedra" (bishop's throne). The
architectural "choir" is sometimes termed the "quire" to differentiate. In
those English cathedrals with two transepts, there is a further area beyond the
choir which is called the Presbytery. This is where the priests or monks could
make their private devotions. Often there are many additional chapels located
towards the eastern end of a cathedral or abbey church. The chief among these
is the Lady Chapel which is dedicated to the Virgin Mary. Altar. The altar in a
church is a table on which is laid the Blessed Sacrament of bread and wine for
consecration by a priest prior to use in the rite of Communion. The main altar
in a church is located in a designated space called the "sanctuary" ("holy
place"). The word has passed into modern English with an altered meaning
because a criminal who could gain access to this area without capture was
thereby given the sanctuary of the church. Many churches have an additional
altar placed further forward in the church, as well as altars in chapels. The
altar of a Catholic church may be made of marble. In most Protestant and
Anglican churches altars are of wood, symbolic of the table of the Last Supper
rather than of a sacrificial altar. The sanctuary is often separated from the
body of the church by railings and screens, and, in the case of Orthodox
churches, by an iconostasis which forms a complete visual as well as physical
barrier. The sanctuary is usually the most ornately decorated part of a church,
creating a visual focus towards the altar. This might be done in several ways.
There might be a carved or painted altarpiece, a large carved screen called a
reredos, or a structure called a ciborium which form a canopy over the altar.
In English churches that have a square eastern end, a very large stained glass
window often fills the wall behind the altar. Choir stalls and organ. The term
"choir" is used in three distinct ways in relation to cathedrals. As well as
the architectural use, it pertains to the choir of "choristers", often men and
boys, that sing at the services. It is also the term used for that section of
the church where the choir sits, and where choral services take place. In a
cathedral or large church, there may be fixed seating in this area, called
"choir stalls" which also provided seating for the cathedral clergy and some
congregation. The choir stalls are often richly carved and decorated. The
bishop's throne or "cathedra" is often located in this space. The choir may be
separated from the nave by a highly decorated screen of wood or stone. The
organ which provides music and accompanies the choir may be located on the
screen, or may be in the gallery above the choir, or in a transept. Some
churches have an organ loft at the west end of the church. Font, lectern and
pulpit. Towards the western end of the nave stands the font, or water basin at
which the rite of Baptism is performed. It is placed towards the door because
the Baptism signifies entry into the community of the church. Standing to the
front of the nave is a lectern from which the Holy Scripture is read. In many
churches this takes the form of an eagle which supports the book on its
outstretched wings and is the symbol of John the Evangelist. The third
significant furnishing of the nave is the pulpit or rostrum from which the
sermon is preached and the biblical readings are expounded. The pulpit might be
of marble or wood, and may be a simple structure or represent a highly
elaborate carved sermon. It is often decorated with the winged figures of a
man, a lion, a bull and an eagle, representing the Gospel writers, Matthew,
Mark, Luke and John. Decoration. The internal decorative features of a
cathedral or great church might follow a carefully conceived scheme which might
continue the theme begun on the west front. There are many examples which give
evidence of this, and include the mosaic vaults of Orthodox churches, the
stained glass windows of Medieval churches and the sculptural schemes of
Baroque churches. However, in many other cases, any unified scheme has been
lost with the vagaries of the building's history. Despite losses and changes of
direction, the over-riding aim in the decoration of church interiors is to
convey the message of the Gospels. To this end, many churches have, in their
decorative schemes, elements of a Poor Man's Bible, illustrating aspects of the
"Life of Christ" and other related narratives, with the aim of educating the
viewer. Among these representations are the "Stations of the Cross" and the
"Crucifix" which was traditionally suspended from the chancel arch, or placed
on a rood screen at the entrance to the quire. Other figurative representations
include sculptures or pictures of saints and prophets, which are the common
subject of the panel paintings on the iconostasis of Orthodox Churches. The
symbolism used in ancient churches is not always easy for modern people to
read. Virtues and vices may be represented by small figures with particular
attributes, or by animals that were thought to embody a particular quality. A
common example is the pelican which was thought to peck its breast to feed its
young on the blood, thus representing the love of Christ for the Church. The
decorative scheme generally culminated at the altar, where there would be a
painted altarpiece or sculptured reredos, or it would be framed by a stained
glass window, or an apsidal mosaic. Architectural style. Early Christian. The
period of architecture termed Early or Paleo-Christian lasted from the first
Christian Church buildings of the early 4th century until the development of a
distinctly Byzantine style which emerged in the reign of Justinian I in the 6th
century, rather than with the removal of the seat of the Roman Empire to
Byzantium by Constantine in 330 CE. Some of the earliest Christian churches
were constructed in Armenia where Christianity became the official religion in
301. The small aisless Basilica of the Holy Cross at Aparan is traditionally
dated to the 4th century. Large Early Christian churches generally took the
form of aisled basilicas with an apse. Among the early larger churches in Rome
the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore has retained much of its original internal
arrangement, its vast basilical proportions, its simple apsidal end, its great
colonnade supporting a straight cornice rather than arches and some very early
mosaic decoration. Santa Sabina, also in Rome, exemplifies the simplicity of
architectural decoration that characterized many of the early Christian
basilicas. Other important churches of this period are the two ancient circular
churches of Rome, The Basilica of Santa Costanza and San Stefano Rotondo. These
churches are marked by their formal application of the Roman architectural
orders in their columns, with Ionic capitals supporting the lintel at Santa
Maria Maggiore, Corinthian capitals at Santa Sabina and Santa Costanza, and all
three orders at San Stefano. At Santa Costanza the thick brick walls of the
central tambour are supported on slim elegant columns that are paired to give
extra strength, each pair supporting a small section of cornice from which the
arches spring. A number of Rome's churches have retained Early Christian
mosaics. Those at Santa Costanza are similar to mosaics and painted decoration
found in public and domestic interiors, being largely geometric or floral, but
close examination reveals much Christian symbolism in the choice of motives.
One of the most extensive decorative shemes from the period to have remained at
least partially intact is that at Santa Maria Maggiore, where the proscenium of
apse is decoration with stories of the "Infancy of Jesus" drawn from the Gospel
of Matthew. Where churches of Early Christian foundation remain, they are
mostly considerably altered, are badly deteriorated and no longer viable, or
are roofless ruins, a state which almost overtook San Stefano, prior to a
renovation in the 15th century. The 4th century Church of the Nativity in
Bethlehem was rebuilt by Justinian I after a fire in the 6th century, but
appears to have retained much of its original form, including its massive Roman
colonnades. The Constantinian Church of the Holy Sepulchre, on the other hand,
was demolished under the order of the Muslim ruler in 1009 so that what stands
today is a total reconstruction. The Euphrasian Basilica in Poreƒç, Croatia,
was founded in 360 on the site of a house church and retaining part of its
Roman pavement. Although renovated and decorated in the late 6th century, the
church has retained Early Christian features, including the atrium. Several
Early Christian churches exist in Syria and Armenia, mostly in a ruined state.
These show Roman rather than Byzantine architectural features, but have a
regional character distinct from those of Rome. Byzantine. Ravenna, on the
eastern coast of Italy, is home to several vast churches of basilica plan
dating from the age of the Emperor Justinian (6th century CE). San Apollinare
Nuovo is in plan similar to Santa Maria Maggiore, but the details of the
carvings are no longer in the classical Roman style. The capitals are like fat
lacy stone cushions. Many of the mosaics are intact. In the same town stands
the uniquely-structured centrally-planned and domed church of San Vitale, of
the same date. Its main internal space is 25¬ m across. The central dome is
surrounded by eight apsidal semi-domes like the petals of a flower. There is a
complex arrangement of curving arcades on several levels which gives a spatial
effect only equalled by the Baroque church of Santa Maria della Salute built a
thousand years later a few miles north in Venice. San Vitale was to be imitated
in the 9th century in a simplified form by Charlemagne at Aachen, Germany. In
Venice stands one of the world's best known Byzantine-style churches, decorated
over many centuries but maintaining its centrally-planned Byzantine form, San
Marco's. It is called St Mark's Basilica, not because it is of basilical shape,
but because it has been awarded that title. It has a Greek Cross plan, a large
dome being surrounded by four somewhat smaller ones. Its decoration, both
inside and out, is typical of the Byzantine period in its lavish use of mosaics
and polychrome marble veneers. Romanesque. After the decline of the Roman
Empire, the building of large churches in Western Europe gradually gained
momentum with the spread of organised monasticism under the rule of Saint
Benedict and others. A huge monastery at Cluny, only a fraction of which still
exists, was built using a simplified Roman style, stout columns, thick walls,
small window openings and semi-circular arches. The style spread with
monasticism throughout Europe. The technique of building high vaults in masonry
was revived. A treatment of decoration evolved that had elements drawn from
local Pre-Christian traditions and incorporated zig-zags, spirals and fierce
animal heads. The typical wall decorations were painted murals. The Romanesque
building techniques spread to England at about the time of the Norman conquest.
Representative of the period are Abbaye aux Hommes (the Abbey of the Men) in
Caen, France; Worms Cathedral in Germany, the Cathedral of Pisa with its famous
leaning campanile (bell tower), Modena Cathedral and the Parma Cathedral in
Italy, and Durham Cathedral and Peterborough Cathedral in England. Gothic. By
the mid 12th century many large cathedrals and abbey churches had been
constructed and the engineering skills required to build high arches, stone
vaults, tall towers and the like, were well established. The style evolved to
one that was less heavy, had larger windows, lighter-weight vaulting supported
on stone ribs and above all, the pointed arch which is the defining
characteristic of the style now known as Gothic. With thinner walls, larger
windows and high pointed arched vaults, the distinctive flying buttresses
developed as a means of support. The huge windows were ornamented with stone
tracery and filled with stained glass illustrating stories from the Bible and
the lives of the Saints. Buildings representative of this period include Notre
Dame, Paris; Chartres Cathedral, Reims Cathedral, Rouen Cathedral, Strasbourg
Cathedral in France, Antwerp Cathedral in Belgium, Cologne Cathedral in
Germany, St Stephen's Cathedral Vienna in Austria, Florence Cathedral, Siena
Cathedral, Milan Cathedral in Italy, Burgos Cathedral, Toledo Cathedral and
Leon Cathedral in Spain, Guarda Cathedral in Portugal, Salisbury Cathedral,
Canterbury Cathedral and Lincoln Cathedral in England. Renaissance. In the
early 15th century a competition was held in Florence for a plan to roof the
central crossing of the huge, unfinished Gothic Cathedral. It was won by the
artist Brunelleschi who, inspired by domes that he had seen on his travels,
such as that of San Vitale in Ravenna and the enormous dome of the Roman period
which roofed the Pantheon, he designed a huge dome which is regarded as the
first building of the Renaissance period. Its style, visually however, is
ribbed and pointed and purely Gothic. It was Renaissance (a rebirth) in its
audacity and the fact that it looked back to Roman structural techniques.
Brunelleschi, and others like him, developed a passion for the highly refined
style of Roman architecture, in which the forms and decorations followed rules
of placement and proportion that had long been neglected. They sought to
rediscover and apply these rules. It was a time of architectural theorising and
experimentation. Brunelleschi built two large churches in Florence
demonstrating how the new style could be applied, San Lorenzo's and Santo
Spirito. They are essays in the Classical, with rows of cylindrical columns,
Corinthian capitals, entablatures, semi-circular arches and apsidal chapels.
The greatest cathedral building of the age was the rebuilding of St Peter's
Basilica in Rome, the combined work of the architects Bramante, Raphael,
Sangallo, Maderno and surmounted by Michelangelo's glorious dome, taller but
just one foot narrower than the one that Brunelleschi had built a hundred years
earlier in Florence. The dome is both an external and an internal focus. The
chancel and transept arms are identical in shape, thus recalling the Greek
Cross plan of Byzantine churches. The nave was, in fact, an addition. Pope
Julius II could command the greatest artists of his day as designers. (The role
of architect had not yet become a separate one from painter, sculptor or
builder.) The product of these many minds is a massive, glorious and unified
whole. Baroque. By the time that St Peter's was completed, a style of
architecture was developed by architects who knew all the rules that had been
so carefully recovered, and chose to break them. The effect was a dynamic style
of architecture in which the forms seem to take on life of their own, moving,
swaying and undulating. The name baroque means 'mis-shapen pearl'. There are
many large churches abbeys and basilicas built in this style, but few
cathedrals in Western Europe, the most notable exception being St Paul's
Cathedral in London. St Paul's is an unusual cathedral in that it was designed
by a single individual and completed in a short time. The architect was Sir
Christopher Wren and the building replaced the ancient cathedral which burnt
down in the Great Fire of 1666. It is in the Baroque style, but it is a very
controlled and English sort of Baroque in which Wren creates surprising and
dramatic spatial effects, particularly in his use of the dome, which, like
Brunelleschi's dome in Florence, spans not only the nave but also the aisles,
opening the whole centre of the church into a vast light space. In Russia, for
the most part, the Baroque style was overlaid as architectonic features on the
essentially Byzantine forms used for church construction. Many churches were
built in this style, notably the Cathedral of the Dormition at Smolensk and the
Cathedral of the Presentation at Solvychegodsk. In the design of many churches
the Byzantine arrangement of tented roof or onion dome is replaced with a
larger dome, usually on a tall, often polygonal, tambour. Many European
cathedrals have baroque features, high altars, fa√ßades and chapels. The
fa√ßades of Santiago de Compostela, Ja√©n Cathedral and Valladolid Cathedral in
Spain was rebuilt at this time. The Baroque style was carried by the Spanish
and Portuguese to South and Central America, to the Philippines and to Goa in
India where it was to become the prominent style of building for churches large
and small. Both in the Americas and the Philippines, large baroque churches
often have a proportionally very wide fa√ßade which seems stretched between the
towers. The intensely ornate decoration both in Spain and the Americas is
called Churrigueresque. Rococo. The Rococo style is a late evolution of Baroque
architecture, first apparent in French domestic architecture and design. It is
distinguished by the asymmetry found within its decoration, generally taking
the form of ornate sculptured cartouches or borders. These decorations are
loosely based on organic objects, particularly seashells and plant growth, but
also on other natural forms that have an apparent "organised chaos" such as
waves of clouds. The churches that are thus decorated may have strongly Baroque
architectural form but a general lightness and delicacy of appearance,
sometimes described as "playfulness". A number of pilgrimage churches in
Bavaria, Germany, are of this style, most notably the Basilica of the Fourteen
Holy Helpers (Vierzehnheiligen) near Bamberg by Johann Balthasar Neumann, the
master and arguably the originator of the style. This combines a relatively
staid exterior with a dynamic internal plan and an exquisitely orchestrated
decorative scheme of painted ceiling and figurative sculpture, all set in a
diverse array of gilded Rococo cartouche. Externally, the fa√ßade has a
rippling surface, and rises with increasing ornateness to fanciful cupolas that
are a hallmark of the churches of Bavaria and much of central and Eastern
Europe. Perhaps the most remarkable large-scale example of Rococo church
building was the Frauenkirche at Dresden, recently rebuilt after its almost
total destruction in World War II. The entire structures embodies a dynamic,
surging motion which combines with a delicacy of architectural detail that is
typical of the Rococo style. This church is dominated by its bell-shaped cupola
which imitates in form those to be found on countless church towers in the
region, but recreated here not in wood sheathed with metal, but as a mighty
masonry dome. Revivals. The 18th and 19th centuries were a time of expansion
and colonisation by Western Europeans. It was also a time of much Christian
revival and in England, a considerable growth in the Roman Catholic Church.
There was also much industrialisation and the growth of towns. New churches and
cathedrals were needed. The Medieval styles, and particularly Gothic, were seen
as the most suitable for the building of new cathedrals, both in Europe and in
the colonies. Cathedrals in the Gothic Revival style include Liverpool Anglican
Cathedral in England, the New Cathedral, Linz in Austria, the Cathedral of
Saint John the Divine in New York and St Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne in
Australia. Not all of the cathedrals that are in a revivalist style are Gothic.
Westminster Cathedral, the seat of the Roman Catholic Archbishop of
Westminster, is an eclectic design of predominantly Byzantine style with
polychrome walls, domes and a very tall Italian-style campanile. Mary, Queen of
the World Cathedral in Canada is a Renaissance revival building based on St
Peter's, Rome. Modern. In the 20th century building in the Medieval style
continued, but in a stripped-down, cleanly functional form, often in brick. A
fine example is Guildford Cathedral in England. Another is Armidale Anglican
Cathedral in Australia. After World War II traditionalist ideas were abandoned
for the rebuilding of the bombed cathedral in Coventry. The old cathedral was
actually a large parish church that had been elevated to cathedral status. Its
glorious spire fortunately escaped severe damage. The new Coventry Cathedral,
of alternating slabs of masonry and stained glass attempts to capture
symbolically the sense of an old cathedral church, without attempting to
reproduce it. Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral is the 20th century's answer to
the centrally-planned church, a vast circular structure with the sanctuary at
the centre. Post Modern. As with other Postmodern movements, the Postmodern
Movement in Architecture formed in reaction to the ideals of modernism as a
response to the perceived blandness, hostility, and Utopianism of the Modern
movement. While rare in designs of Church architecture, there are nonetheless
some notable examples as architects have begun to recover and renew historical
styles and "cultural memory" of Christian architecture. Notable practitioners
include Dr. Steven Schloeder, Duncan Stroik, and Thomas Gordon Smith. The
functional and formalized shapes and spaces of the modernist movement are
replaced by unapologetically diverse aesthetics: styles collide, form is
adopted for its own sake, and new ways of viewing familiar styles and space
abound. Perhaps most obviously, architects rediscovered the expressive and
symbolic value of architectural elements and forms that had evolved through
centuries of building‚Äîoften maintaining meaning in literature, poetry and
art‚Äîbut which had been abandoned by the modern movement.
