Persecution of Christians  Christian missionaries as well as the neophytes that
they converted to Christianity have been the target of persecution, many times
to the point of being martyred for their faith. There is also a history of
individual Christian denominations suffering persecution at the hands of other
Christians under the charge of heresy, particularly during the 16th century
Protestant Reformation. In the 20th century, Christians have been persecuted by
Muslim groups, and by atheistic states such as the USSR and North Korea.
Currently (as of 2012), as estimated by the Christian missionary organisation
Open Doors UK, an estimated 100 million Christians face persecution,
particularly in Muslim dominated countries like, Iran and Saudi Arabia.
Christians in Pakistan are reportedly being subjected to a genocide by
Pakistani Taliban. They also face persecution in atheistic states like North
Korea in which there is no religious freedom. A recent study, cited by the
Vatican, reported that 75 out of every 100 people killed due to religious
hatred were Christian. Antiquity. Persecution of Christians in the New
Testament. Early Christianity began as a sect among early Jews and according to
the New Testament account, Pharisees, including Paul of Tarsus prior to his
conversion to Christianity, persecuted early Christians. The early Christians
preached a Messiah which did not conform to the expectations of the time.
However, feeling that he was presaged in Isaiah's Suffering Servant and in all
of Jewish scripture, Christians had been hopeful that their countrymen would
accept their vision of a New Israel. Despite many individual conversions, a
fierce opposition was found in their countrymen. Dissention began almost
immediately with the teachings of Stephen at Jerusalem (unorthodox by
contemporaneous Jewish standards), and never ceased entirely while the city
remained. A year after the Crucifixion of Jesus, Stephen was stoned for his
alleged transgression of orthodoxy, with Saul (who later converted and was
renamed "Paul") heartily agreeing. In 41 AD, when Agrippa I, who already
possessed the territory of Antipas and Phillip, obtained the title of "King of
the Jews", in a sense re-forming the Kingdom of Herod, he was reportedly eager
to endear himself to his Jewish subjects and continued the persecution in which
James the Lesser lost his life, Peter narrowly escaped and the rest of the
apostles took flight. After Agrippa's death, the Roman procuratorship began
(before 41 they were Prefects in Iudaea Province) and those leaders maintained
a neutral peace, until the procurator Festus died and the high priest Annas II
took advantage of the power vacuum to attack the Church and executed James the
Greater, then leader of Jerusalem's Christians. The New Testament states that
Paul was himself imprisoned on several occasions by Roman authorities, stoned
by Pharisees and left for dead on one occasion, and was eventually taken as a
prisoner to Rome. Peter and other early Christians were also imprisoned, beaten
and harassed. A Jewish revolt, spurred by the Roman killing of 3,000 Jews, led
to the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD, the end of sacrificial Judaism (until
the Third Temple), and the disempowering of the Jewish persecutors; the
Christian community, meanwhile, having fled to safety in the already pacified
region of Pella. The early persecution by the Jews is estimated to have a death
toll of about 2,000. The Jewish persecutions were trivial when compared with
the brutal and widespread persecution by the Romans. Of the eleven remaining
apostles (Judas Iscariot having killed himself), only one‚ÄîJohn the Apostle,
the son of Zebedee and the younger brother of the Apostle James‚Äîdied of
natural causes in exile. The other ten were reportedly martyred by various
means including beheading, by sword and spear and, in the case of Peter,
crucifixion upside down following the execution of his wife. The Romans were
involved in some of these persecutions. The New Testament, especially the
Gospel of John, has traditionally been interpreted as relating Christian
accounts of the Pharisee rejection of Jesus and accusations of the Pharisee
responsibility for his crucifixion. The Acts of the Apostles depicts instances
of early Christian persecution by the Sanhedrin, the Jewish religious court of
the time. Walter Laqueur argues that hostility between Christians and Jews grew
over the generations. By the 4th century, John Chrysostom was arguing that the
Pharisees alone, not the Romans, were responsible for the murder of Christ.
However, according to Laqueur: "Absolving Pilate from guilt may have been
connected with the missionary activities of early Christianity in Rome and the
desire not to antagonize those they want to convert." At least by the 4th
century, the consensus amongst scholars is that persecution of Christians by
Jews has been traditionally overstated; according to James Everett Seaver,
Persecution of early Christians in the Roman Empire. Persecution under Nero,
64‚Äì68 AD. The first documented case of imperially supervised persecution of
the Christians in the Roman Empire begins with Nero (37‚Äì68). In 64 AD, a
great fire broke out in Rome, destroying portions of the city and economically
devastating the Roman population. Nero himself was suspected as the arsonist by
Suetonius, claiming he played the lyre and sang the 'Sack of Ilium' during the
fires. In his "Annals", Tacitus (who claimed Nero was in Antium at the time of
the fire's outbreak), stated that ""to get rid of the report, Nero fastened the
guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their
abominations, called Christians" Chrestians "by the populace"" (Tacit. "Annals"
XV, see Tacitus on Jesus). Suetonius, later to the period, does not mention any
persecution after the fire, but in a previous paragraph unrelated to the fire,
mentions punishments inflicted on Christians, defined as men following a new
and malefic superstition. Suetonius however does not specify the reasons for
the punishment, he just listed the fact together with other abuses put down by
Nero. Persecution from the 2nd century to Constantine. By the mid-2nd century,
mobs could be found willing to throw stones at Christians, and they might be
mobilized by rival sects. The Persecution in Lyon was preceded by mob violence,
including assaults, robberies and stonings (Eusebius, "Ecclesiastical History"
5.1.7). Further state persecutions were desultory until the 3rd century, though
Tertullian's "Apologeticus" of 197 was ostensibly written in defense of
persecuted Christians and addressed to Roman governors. The "edict of Septimius
Severus" familiar in Christian history is doubted by some secular historians to
have existed outside Christian martyrology. The first documentable Empire-wide
persecution took place under Maximinus Thrax, though only the clergy were
sought out. It was not until Decius during the mid-century that a persecution
of Christian laity across the Empire took place. Christian sources aver that a
decree was issued requiring public sacrifice, a formality equivalent to a
testimonial of allegiance to the Emperor and the established order. Decius
authorized roving commissions visiting the cities and villages to supervise the
execution of the sacrifices and to deliver written certificates to all citizens
who performed them. Christians were often given opportunities to avoid further
punishment by publicly offering sacrifices or burning incense to Roman gods,
and were accused by the Romans of impiety when they refused. Refusal was
punished by arrest, imprisonment, torture, and executions. Christians fled to
safe havens in the countryside and some purchased their certificates, called
"libelli." Several councils held at Carthage debated the extent to which the
community should accept these lapsed Christians. Some early Christians sought
out and welcomed martyrdom. Roman authorities tried hard to avoid Christians
because they "goaded, chided, belittled and insulted the crowds until they
demanded their death." According to Droge and Tabor, "in 185 the proconsul of
Asia, Arrius Antoninus, was approached by a group of Christians demanding to be
executed. The proconsul obliged some of them and then sent the rest away,
saying that if they wanted to kill themselves there was plenty of rope
available or cliffs they could jump off." Such seeking after death is found in
Tertullian's "Scorpiace" or in the letters of Saint Ignatius of Antioch but was
certainly not the only view of martyrdom in the Christian church. Both Polycarp
and Cyprian, bishops in Smyrna and Carthage respectively, attempted to avoid
martyrdom. The Great Persecution. The persecutions culminated with Diocletian
and Galerius at the end of the third and beginning of the 4th century. The
Great Persecution is considered the largest. Beginning with a series of four
edicts banning Christian practices and ordering the imprisonment of Christian
clergy, the persecution intensified until all Christians in the empire were
commanded to sacrifice to the gods or face immediate execution. Over 20,000
Christians are thought to have died during Diocletian's reign. However, as
Diocletian zealously persecuted Christians in the Eastern part of the empire,
his co-emperors in the West did not follow the edicts and so Christians in
Gaul, Spain, and Britannia were virtually unmolested. This persecution lasted,
until Constantine I came to power in 313 and legalized Christianity. It was not
until Theodosius I in the later 4th century that Christianity would become the
official religion of the Empire. Between these two events Julian II temporarily
restored the traditional Roman religion and established broad religious
tolerance renewing Pagan and Christian hostilities. The conditions under which
martyrdom was an acceptable fate or under which it was suicidally embraced
occupied writers of the early Christian Church. Broadly speaking, martyrs were
considered uniquely exemplary of the Christian faith, and few early saints were
not also martyrs. The "New Catholic Encyclopedia" states that "Ancient,
medieval and early modern hagiographers were inclined to exaggerate the number
of martyrs. Since the title of martyr is the highest title to which a Christian
can aspire, this tendency is natural". Estimates of Christians killed for
religious reasons before the year 313 vary greatly, depending on the scholar
quoted, from a high of almost 100,000 to a low of 10,000. Persecutions of early
Christians outside the Roman Empire. In 341, the Zoroastrian Shapur II ordered
the massacre of all Christians in the Persian Sassanid Empire. During the
persecution, about 1,150 Assyrian Christians were martyred under Shapur II in
Assuristan (Sassanid ruled Assyria). In the 4th century, the Terving King
Athanaric began persecuting Christians, many of whom were killed. Persecution
of Christians during the Middle Ages. Persecution of Christians by Persians and
Jews during Roman-Persian Wars. According to Antiochus Strategos, a 7th century
monk in Palestine, shortly after the Persian army entered Jerusalem in 614,
unprecedented looting and sacrilege took place. Church after church was burned
down alongside the innumerable Christian artifacts, which were stolen or
damaged by the ensuing arson. Given that Khosrau II generally practiced
religious tolerance and did deem Christians respectfully, it is not known why
Shahrbaraz ordered such a massacre. One reason could simply have been
Shahrbaraz's rage at the resistance that had been offered by Jerusalem's
Christian populace. Then the Jews... as of old they bought the Lord from the
Jews with silver, so they purchased Christians out of the reservoir; for they
gave the Persians silver, and they bought a Christian and slew him like a
sheep. According to Antiochus, the total Christian death toll was 66,509, of
which 24,518 corpses were found at Mamilla, many more than were found anywhere
else in the city. Other manuscripts suggest less where found at Mamilla 4518 or
4618 . Other sources give a figure of 60,000 slain. The Jews destroyed the
Christian churches and the monasteries, books were burnt and monks and priests
killed. According to Israeli archeologists, there was no destruction of
churches. A mass burial grave at Mamilla cave was discovered in 1989 by Israeli
archeologist Ronny Reich. The massacre appeared to have happened after
Christians revolted a few months after the capture of Jerusalem. They were able
to briefly retake the city for 19 days before the walls where breached. Killing
the new ruler of Jerusalem the Exilarch Nehemiah ben Hushiel and his "council
of the righteous" and dragging their bodies through the streets. Christians in
this time period had allied themselves with the Eastern Roman Empire.
Archaeological evidence does not currently support the idea that churches were
burnt. Christian sources may well have reason to exaggerate the extent of the
massacre as they would later in 628 massacre, forcible convert and expel the
Jews. Persecution of Christians in the early and medieval Caliphates. In
general, Christians subject to Islamic rule were allowed to practice their
religion with some notable limitations, see Pact of Umar. As People of the Book
they were awarded dhimmi status (along with Jews and Mandeans), which, although
inferior to the status of Muslims, was more favourable than the plight of
adherents of non-Abrahamic faiths such as Zoroastrians and Pagans. At times,
anti-Christian pogroms occurred. Under sharia, non-Muslims are obligated to pay
jizya taxes, which contributed a significant proportion of income for the
Islamic state and persuaded many Christians to convert to Islam (Stillman
(1979), p.¬ 160.). According to the Hanafi school of sharia, the testimony of a
non-Muslim (such as a Christian) was not considered valid against the testimony
of a Muslim. Other schools differed. Christian men were not allowed to marry a
Muslim woman under sharia. Muslim men on the other hand were allowed to marry
Christian women. Christians under Islamic rule had the right to convert to
Islam or any other religion, while a murtad, or apostate of Islam, faced severe
penalties or even hadd, which could include the death penalty. Tamerlane
instigated large scale massacres of Christians in Mesopotamia, Persia, Asia
Minor and Syria in the 14th century AD. Most of the victims were indigenous
Assyrians, Arameans and Armenians, members of the Assyrian Church of the East
and Orthodox Churches, which led to the decimation of the hitherto majority
Assyrian population in northern Mesopotamia. Medieval Christian persecution of
heresy. In the medieval period the Roman Catholic Church moved to suppress the
Cathar heresy, the Pope having sanctioned a crusade against the Albigensians,
during the course of which the massacre of B√©ziers took place, with between
seven and twenty thousand deaths. Papal legate Arnaud Amalric, when asked how
Catholics could be distinguished from Cathars once the city fell, famously
replied, "Kill them all, God will know His own." Over the twenty-year period of
this campaign an estimated 200,000 to 1,000,000 people were killed. John Huss,
a Bohemian preacher of reformation, was burned at the stake on 6 July 1415.
Pope Martin V issued a bull on 17 March 1420 which proclaimed a crusade "for
the destruction of the Wycliffites, Hussites and all other heretics in
Bohemia". The Crusades in the Middle East also spilled over into conquest of
Eastern Orthodox Christians by Roman Catholics and attempted suppression of the
Orthodox Church. The Waldenses were as well persecuted by the Catholic Church,
but survive up to this day. Early Modern period (1500 to 1815). Reformation.
The Reformation led to a long period of warfare and communal violence between
Catholic and Protestant factions, leading to massacres and forced suppression
of the alternative views by the dominant faction in much of Europe. Anti-
Catholic. Anti-Catholicism officially began in 1534 during the English
Reformation; the Act of Supremacy made the King of England the 'only supreme
head on earth of the Church in England.' Any act of allegiance to the latter
was considered treason. It was under this act that Thomas More was executed.
Queen Elizabeth I's scorn for Jesuit missionaries led to many executions at
Tyburn. As punishment for the rebellion of 1641, almost all lands owned by
Irish Catholics were confiscated and given to Protestant settlers. Under the
penal laws no Irish Catholic could sit in the Parliament of Ireland, even
though some 90% of Ireland's population was native Irish Catholic when the
first of these bans was introduced in 1691. Catholic / Protestant strife has
been blamed for much of "The Troubles", the ongoing struggle in Northern
Ireland. This attitude was carried to the English colonies in America, which
eventually became the United States. In these colonies, Catholicism was
introduced with the settling of Maryland in 1634; this colony offered a rare
example of religious toleration in a fairly intolerant age, particularly
amongst other English colonies which frequently exhibited a quite militant
Protestantism. (See the Maryland Toleration Act, and note the pre-eminence of
the Archdiocese of Baltimore in Catholic circles.) However, at the time of the
American Revolution, Catholics formed less than 1% of the population of the
thirteen colonies. Anti-Eastern Orthodox. In 1656, Macarios III Zaim, who was
the Greek Patriarch of Antioch, lamented over the atrocities committed by the
Polish Catholics against followers of Greek Orthodoxy. Macarios was quoted as
stating that seventy or eighty thousand followers of Eastern Orthodoxy were
killed under hands of the Catholics. Greek Patriarch Macarios desired Turkish
sovereignty over Catholic subjugation, stating: The preaching of Islam: a
history of the propagation of the Muslim faith By Sir Thomas Walker Arnold, pg.
134‚Äì135 Anti-Protestant. Anti-Protestantism originated in a reaction by the
Catholic Church against the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century.
Protestants were denounced as heretics and subject to persecution in those
territories, such as Spain, Italy and the Netherlands, by the Inquisition, in
which the Catholics were the dominant power. This movement was orchestrated by
Popes and Princes as the Counter Reformation. This resulted in religious wars
and eruptions of sectarian hatred such as the St Bartholomew's Day Massacre of
1572. Persecution of the Anabaptists. When the disputes between Lutherans and
Roman Catholics gained a political dimension, both groups saw other groups of
religious dissidents that were arising as a danger to their own security. The
early "T√§ufer" (lit. "Baptists") were mistrusted and rejected by both religio-
political parties. Religious persecution is often perpetrated as a means of
political control, and this becomes evident with the Treaty of Augsburg in
1555. This treaty provided the legal groundwork for persecution of the
Anabaptists. China. Beginning in the late 17th century, Christianity was banned
for at least a century in China by Emperor Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty after the
Pope forbade Chinese Catholics from venerating their relatives or Confucius.
During the Boxer Rebellion, anti Christian Boxers, and Muslim Kansu Braves
serving in the Chinese army attacked Christians. During the Northern
Expedition, the Kuomintang incited anti-foreign, anti-Western sentiment.
Portraits of Sun Yat-sen replaced the crucifix in several churches, KMT posters
proclaimed- "Jesus Christ is dead. Why not worship something alive such as
Nationalism?". Foreign missionaries were attacked and anti foreign riots broke
out. During the Northern Expedition, in 1926 in Guangxi, Muslim General Bai
Chongxi led his troops in destroying Buddhist temples and smashing idols,
turning the temples into schools and Kuomintang party headquarters. It was
reported that almost all of Buddhist monasteries in Guangxi were destroyed by
Bai in this manner. The monks were removed. Bai led a wave of anti foreignism
in Guangxi, attacking American, European, and other foreigners and
missionaries, and generally making the province unsafe for foreigners.
Westerners fled from the province, and some Chinese Christians were also
attacked as imperialist agents. Japan. Tokugawa Ieyasu assumed control over
Japan in 1600. Like Toyotomi Hideyoshi, he disliked Christian activities in
Japan. The Tokugawa shogunate finally decided to ban Catholicism, in 1614 and
in the mid-17th century it demanded the expulsion of all European missionaries
and the execution of all converts. This marked the end of open Christianity in
Japan. The Shimabara Rebellion, led by a young Japanese Christian boy named
Amakusa Shiro Tokisada, took place in 1637. After the Hara Castle fell, the
shogunate's forces beheaded an estimated 37,000 rebels and sympathizers.
Amakusa Shir≈ç's severed head was taken to Nagasaki for public display, and the
entire complex at Hara Castle was burned to the ground and buried together with
the bodies of all the dead. Many of the Christians in Japan continued for two
centuries to maintain their religion as Kakure Kirishitan, or hidden
Christians, without any priests or pastors. Some of those who were killed for
their Faith are venerated as the Martyrs of Japan. Although Christianity was
later allowed during the Meiji era, Christians were again persecuted during the
period of State Shinto, and even in the 21st century Christians are often
expected to work on Sundays and Christmas. India. In spite of the fact that
there have been relatively fewer conflicts between Muslims and Christians in
India in comparison to those between Muslims and Hindus, or Muslims and Sikhs,
the relationship between Muslims and Christians have been occasionally
turbulent. With the advent of European colonialism in India throughout the
16th, 17th and 18th centuries, Christians were systematically persecuted in a
few Muslim ruled kingdoms in India. Modern day persecution also exists carried
out by Hindu nationalists. A report by Human Rights Watch stated that there is
a rise of anti-Christian violence due to Hindu nationalism and Smita Narula,
Researcher, Asia Division of Human Rights Watch stated "Christians are the new
scapegoat in India's political battles. Without immediate and decisive action
by the government, communal tensions will continue to be exploited for
political and economic ends." Perhaps the most infamous acts of anti-Christian
persecution by Muslims was committed by Tippu Sultan, the ruler of the Kingdom
of Mysore against the Mangalorean Catholic community from Mangalore and the
erstwhile South Canara district on the southwestern coast of India. Tippu was
widely reputed to be anti-Christian. The captivity of Mangalorean Catholics at
Seringapatam, began on 24 February 1784 and ended on 4 May 1799. ""All
Musalmans should unite together, and considering the annihilation of infidels
as a sacred duty, labor to the utmost of their power, to accomplish that
subject."" Soon after the Treaty of Mangalore in 1784, Tippu gained control of
Canara. He issued orders to seize the Christians in Canara, confiscate their
estates, and deport them to Seringapatam, the capital of his empire, through
the Jamalabad fort route. There were no priests among the captives. Together
with Fr Miranda, all the 21 arrested priests were issued orders of expulsion to
Goa, fined Rs 2 lakhs, and threatened death by hanging if they ever returned.
Tippu ordered the destruction of 27 Catholic churches. Among them were the
Church of Nossa Senhora de Rosario Milagres at Mangalore, Fr Miranda's Seminary
at Monte Mariano, Church of Jesu Marie Jose at Omzoor, Chapel at Bolar, Church
of Merces at Ullal, Imaculata Conceiciao at Mulki, San Jose at Perar, Nossa
Senhora dos Remedios at Kirem, Sao Lawrence at Karkal, Rosario at Barkur,
Immaculata Conceciao at Baidnur. All were razed to the ground, with the
exception of "Igreja da Santa Cruz Hospet" also known as Hospet Church at
Hospet,owing to the friendly offices of the Chauta Raja of Moodbidri. According
to Thomas Munro, a Scottish soldier and the first collector of Canara, around
60,000 of them, nearly 92¬ percent of the entire Mangalorean Catholic
community, were captured, only 7,000 escaped. Francis Buchanan gives the
numbers as 70,000 captured, from a population of 80,000, with 10,000 escaping.
They were forced to climb nearly through the jungles of the Western Ghat
mountain ranges. It was from Mangalore to Seringapatam, and the journey took
six weeks. According to British Government records, 20,000¬  of them died on
the march to Seringapatam. According to James Scurry, a British officer, who
was held captive along with Mangalorean Catholics, 30,000¬ of them were
forcibly converted to Islam. The young women and girls were forcibly made wives
of the Muslims living there. The young men who offered resistance were
disfigured by cutting their noses, upper lips, and ears. According to Mr. Silva
of Gangolim, a survivor of the captivity, if a person who had escaped from
Seringapatam was found, the punishment under the orders of Tippu was the
cutting off of the ears, nose, the feet and one hand. The Archbishop of Goa
wrote in 1800, ""It is notoriously known in all Asia and all other parts of the
globe of the oppression and sufferings experienced by the Christians in the
Dominion of the King of Kanara, during the usurpation of that country by Tipu
Sultan from an implacable hatred he had against them who professed
Christianity."" Tippu Sultan's invasion of the Malabar Coast had an adverse
impact on the Saint Thomas Christian community of the Malabar coast. Many
churches in Malabar and Cochin were damaged. The old Syrian Nasrani seminary at
Angamaly which had been the center of Catholic religious education for several
centuries was razed to the ground by Tippu's soldiers. Many centuries-old
religious manuscripts were lost forever. The church was later relocated to
Kottayam where it still exists to this date. The Mor Sabor church at Akaparambu
and the Martha Mariam Church attached to the seminary were destroyed as well.
Tippu's army set fire to the church at Palayoor and attacked the Ollur Church
in 1790. Furthernmore, the Arthat church and the Ambazhakkad seminary was also
destroyed. Over the course of this invasion, many Saint Thomas Christians were
killed or forcibly converted to Islam. Most of the coconut, arecanut, pepper
and cashew plantations held by the Saint Thomas Christian farmers were also
indiscriminately destroyed by the invading army. As a result, when Tippu's army
invaded Guruvayur and adjacent areas, the Syrian Christian community fled
Calicut and small towns like Arthat to new centres like Kunnamkulam, Chalakudi,
Ennakadu, Cheppadu, Kannankode, Mavelikkara, etc. where there were already
Christians. They were given refuge by Sakthan Tamburan, the ruler of Cochin and
Karthika Thirunal, the ruler of Travancore, who gave them lands, plantations
and encouraged their businesses. Colonel Macqulay, the British resident of
Travancore also helped them. Tippu's persecution of Christians also extended to
captured British soldiers. For instance, there were a significant amount of
forced conversions of British captives between 1780 and 1784. Following their
disastrous defeat at the battle of Pollilur, 7,000 British men along with an
unknown number of women were held captive by Tippu in the fortress of
Seringapatnam. Of these, over 300 were circumcised and given Muslim names and
clothes and several British regimental drummer boys were made to wear "ghagra
cholis" and entertain the court as "nautch" girls or dancing girls. After the
10 year long captivity ended, James Scurry, one of those prisoners, recounted
that he had forgotten how to sit in a chair and use a knife and fork. His
English was broken and stilted, having lost all his vernacular idiom. His skin
had darkened to the swarthy complexion of negroes, and moreover, he had
developed an aversion to wearing European clothes. During the surrender of the
Mangalore fort which was delivered in an armistice by the British and their
subsequent withdrawal, all the Mestizos and remaining non-British foreigners
were killed, together with 5,600 Mangalorean Catholics. Those condemned by
Tippu Sultan for treachery were hanged instantly, the gibbets being weighed
down by the number of bodies they carried. The Netravati River was so putrid
with the stench of dying bodies, that the local residents were forced to leave
their riverside homes. Besides Historical persecution there have been several
attacks in Modern day India carried out mainly by Hindu radicals such as the
waves of attacks in Karnataka where attacks were directed against Christian
churches and prayer halls in Karnataka by the Bajrang Dal, with the ruling BJP
government accused of involvement. The violence started from 14 September 2008
when about 20 churches were vandalized in Mangalore, Udupi, Chikkamagaluru, and
in other districts of Karnataka. Minor violence was later reported from the
border state of Kerala. Also in Gujarat where 22 churches were burnt or
destroyed, and another 16 damaged. Anti-Christian violence also flared up in
Orissa which was triggered by the killing of Graham Staines who was an
Australian missionary working with the Evangelical Missionary Society of
Mayurbhanj, an Australian missionary society. On the night of 22 January 1999,
he was sleeping in his station wagon when it was set afire. Graham and his two
sons, ten-year-old Philip and six-year-old Timothy, were killed. Dara Singh, a
Hindu fanatic from Etawah in Uttar Pradesh, was arrested for the crime. On 22
September 2003 a court appointed by the Central Bureau of Investigation
sentenced Dara Singh to death and 12 others to life imprisonment for the
murders. French Revolution. The Dechristianisation of France during the French
Revolution is a conventional description of a campaign, conducted by various
Robespierre-era governments of France beginning with the start of the French
Revolution in 1789, to eliminate any symbol that might be associated with the
past, especially the monarchy. The climax was reached with the celebration of
the Goddess "Reason" in Notre Dame Cathedral on 10 November. Under threat of
death, imprisonment, military conscription or loss of income, about 20,000
constitutional priests were forced to abdicate or hand over their letters of
ordination and 6,000 ‚Äì 9,000 were coerced to marry, many ceasing their
ministerial duties. Some of those who abdicated covertly ministered to the
people. By the end of the decade, approximately 30,000 priests were forced to
leave France, and thousands who did not leave were executed. Most of France was
left without the services of a priest, deprived of/liberated from the
sacraments and any nonjuring priest faced the guillotine or deportation to
French Guiana. The March 1793 conscription requiring Vendeans to fill their
district's quota of 300,000 enraged the populace, who took up arms as "The
Catholic Army", "Royal" being added later, and fought for "above all the
reopening of their parish churches with their former priests." A massacre of
6,000 Vend√©e prisoners, many of them women, took place after the battle of
Savenay, along with the drowning of 3,000 Vend√©e women at Pont-au-Baux and
5,000 Vend√©e priests, old men, women, and children killed by drowning at the
Loire River at Nantes in what was called the "national bath" ‚Äì tied in groups
in barges and then sunk into the Loire. With these massacres came formal orders
for forced evacuation; also, a 'scorched earth' policy was initiated: farms
were destroyed, crops and forests burned and villages razed. There were many
reported atrocities and a campaign of mass killing universally targeted at
residents of the Vend√©e regardless of combatant status, political affiliation,
age or gender. By July 1796, the estimated Vendean dead numbered between
117,000 and 500,000, out of a population of around 800,000. Some historians
call these mass killings the first modern genocide, specifically because intent
to exterminate the Catholic Vendeans was clearly stated, though others have
rejected these claims. Modern era (1815 to 1989). Ottoman Empire. In 1842
Assyrians living in the mountains of Hakkari in south east Anatolia faced a
massive unprovoked attack from Ottoman forces and Kurdish irregulars, which
resulted in the death of tens of thousands of unarmed Christian Assyrians. A
major massacre of Assyrians and Armenians in the Ottoman Empire occurred
between 1894 and 1897 AD by Turkish troops and their Kurdish supporters during
the rule of Sultan Abdul Hamid II (the Hamidian massacre). The motives for
these massacres were an attempt to reassert Pan-Islamism in the Ottoman Empire,
resentment at the comparative wealth of the ancient indigenous Christian
communities, and a fear that they would attempt to secede from the tottering
Ottoman Empire. Assyrians and Armenians were massacred in Diyarbakir,
Hasankeyef, Sivas and other parts of Anatolia and northern Mesopotamia, by
Sultan Abdul Hamid II. These attacks caused the death of tens of thousands of
Assyrians and Armenians and the forced "Ottomanisation" of the inhabitants of
245 villages. The Turkish troops looted the remains of settlements and these
were later stolen and occupied by Muslim Kurds. Unarmed Christian women and
children were raped, tortured and murdered. The Young Turks government of the
collapsing Ottoman Empire in 1915 persecuted Christian populations in Anatolia,
Persia and Northern Mesopotamia. The onslaught by the Ottoman army, including
Kurdish and Circassian irregulars resulting in an estimated 2.1 million deaths,
divided between roughly 1.2 Million Armenian Christians, 0.75 million Assyrians
and 0.3 million Greek Orthodox Christians, a number of Georgians were also
killed. The Genocide led to the devastation of ancient indigenous Christian
peoples who had existed in the region for thousands of years. Soviet Union and
Warsaw Pact Countries. After the Revolution of 1917, the Bolsheviks undertook a
massive program to remove the influence of the Russian Orthodox Church from the
government while outlawing antisemitism in Russian society, and promoting state
atheist. Tens of thousands of churches were destroyed or converted to other
uses, and many members of clergy were murdered, including public executions and
imprisonment for what the government termed "anti-government activities." An
extensive education and propaganda campaign was undertaken to convince people,
especially the children and youth, to abandon religious beliefs. This
persecution resulted in the intentional murders of sixty million Orthodox
followers in the 20th century by the Soviet Union. This persecution spread not
only to the Orthodox, but also other groups, such as the Mennonites, who
largely fled to the Americas. Before and after the October Revolution of 7
November 1917 (25 October Old Calendar) there was a movement within the Soviet
Union to unite all of the people of the world under Communist rule (see
Communist International). This included the Eastern European bloc countries as
well as the Balkan States. Since some of these Slavic states tied their ethnic
heritage to their ethnic churches, both the peoples and their church were
targeted for ethnic and political genocide by the Soviets and its form of State
atheism. The Soviets' official religious stance was one of "religious freedom
or tolerance", though the state established atheism as the only scientific
truth (see also the Soviet or committee of the All-Union Society for the
Dissemination of Scientific and Political Knowledge or Znanie which was until
1947 called The League of the Militant Godless and various Intelligentsia
groups). Criticism of atheism was strictly forbidden and sometimes resulted in
imprisonment. Some of the more high profile individuals executed include
Metropolitan Benjamin of Petrograd, Priest and scientist Pavel Florensky and
Bishop Gorazd Pavlik. The Communist regime confiscated church property,
ridiculed religion, harassed believers, and propagated atheism in the schools.
Actions toward particular religions, however, were determined by State
interests, and most organized religions were never outlawed. It is estimated
that 500,000 Russian Orthodox Christians were martyred in the gulags by the
Soviet government, not including torture or other Christian denominations
killed. Some actions against Orthodox priests and believers along with
execution included torture being sent to prison camps, labour camps or mental
hospitals. The result of state sponsored atheism was to transform the Church
into a persecuted and martyred Church. In the first five years after the
Bolshevik revolution, 28 bishops and 1,200 priests were executed. The main
target of the anti-religious campaign in the 1920s and 1930s was the Russian
Orthodox Church, which had the largest number of faithful. A very large segment
of its clergy, and many of its believers, were shot or sent to labor camps.
Theological schools were closed, and church publications were prohibited. In
the period between 1927 and 1940, the number of Orthodox Churches in the
Russian Republic fell from 29,584 to less than 500. Between 1917 and 1940,
130,000 Orthodox priests were arrested. The widespread persecution and
internecine disputes within the church hierarchy lead to the seat of Patriarch
of Moscow being vacant from 1925 to 1943. After Nazi Germany's attack on the
Soviet Union in 1941, Joseph Stalin revived the Russian Orthodox Church to
intensify patriotic support for the war effort. By 1957 about 22,000 Russian
Orthodox churches had become active. But in 1959 Nikita Khrushchev initiated
his own campaign against the Russian Orthodox Church and forced the closure of
about 12,000 churches. By 1985 fewer than 7,000 churches remained active. In
the Soviet Union, in addition to the methodical closing and destruction of
churches, the charitable and social work formerly done by ecclesiastical
authorities was taken over by the state. As with all private property, Church
owned property was confiscated into public use. The few places of worship left
to the Church were legally viewed as state property which the government
permitted the church to use. After the advent of state funded universal
education, the Church was not permitted to carry on educational, instructional
activity for children. For adults, only training for church-related occupations
was allowed. Outside of sermons during the celebration of the divine liturgy it
could not instruct or evangelise to the faithful or its youth. Catechism
classes, religious schools, study groups, Sunday schools and religious
publications were all illegal and or banned. This caused many religious tracts
to be circulated as illegal literature or samizdat. This persecution continued,
even after the death of Stalin until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in
1991. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, the Russian Orthodox Church has
recognized a number of New Martyrs as saints, some executed during Mass
operations of the NKVD under directives like NKVD Order No. 00447. 19th and
20th century Mexico. In the 19th century, Mexican President Benito Ju√°rez
confiscated church lands. The Mexican government's campaign against the
Catholic Church after the Mexican Revolution culminated in the 1917
constitution which contained numerous articles which Catholics perceived as
violating their civil rights: outlawing monastic religious orders, forbidding
public worship outside of church buildings, restricted religious organizations'
rights to own property, and taking away basic civil rights of members of the
clergy (priests and religious leaders were prevented from wearing their habits,
were denied the right to vote, and were not permitted to comment on public
affairs in the press and were denied the right to trial for violation of
anticlerical laws). When the first embassy of the Soviet Union in any country
was opened in Mexico, the Soviet ambassador remarked that "no other two
countries show more similarities than the Soviet Union and Mexico". When the
Church publicly condemned the anticlerical measures which had not been strongly
enforced, the atheist President Plutarco Calles sought to vigorously enforce
the provisions and enacted additional anti-Catholic legislation known as the
Calles Law. At this time, some in the United States government, considering
Calles' regime Bolshevik, started to refer to Mexico as "Soviet Mexico". Weary
of the persecution, in many parts of the country a popular rebellion called the
Cristero War began (so named because the rebels felt they were fighting for
Christ himself). The effects of the persecution on the Church were profound.
Between 1926 and 1934 at least 40 priests were killed. Where there were 4,500
priests serving the people before the rebellion, in 1934 there were only 334
priests licensed by the government to serve fifteen million people, the rest
having been eliminated by emigration, expulsion and assassination. By 1935, 17
states had no priest at all. In the second Cristero rebellion (1932), the
Cristeros took particular exception to the socialist education, which Calles
had also implemented but which President Cardenas had added to the 1917 Mexican
Constitution. Anti-Mormonism. The Latter Day Saint Movement, (Mormons) have
been persecuted since their founding in the 1830s. This persecution drove them
from New York and Ohio to Missouri, where they continued to suffer violent
attacks. In 1838, Gov. Lilburn Boggs declared that Mormons had made war on the
state of Missouri, and "must be treated as enemies, and must be exterminated or
driven from the state" At least 10,000 were expelled from the State. In the
most violent of the altercations at this time, the Haun's mill Massacre, 17
were murdered by an anti-Mormon mob and 13 were wounded. The Extermination
Order sign by Governor Boggs was not invalidated until 25 June 1976, 137 years
after being signed. The Mormons subsequently fled to Nauvoo, Illinois, where
hostilities again escalated. In Carthage, Ill., where Joseph Smith was being
held on the charge of treason, a mob stormed the jail and killed him. Smith's
brother, Hyrum, was also killed. After a succession crisis, most united under
Brigham Young, who organized an evacuation from the United States after the
federal government refused to protect them. 70,000 Mormon pioneers crossed the
Great Plains to settle in the Salt Lake Valley and surrounding areas. After the
Mexican-American War, the area became the US territory of Utah. Over the next
46 years several actions by the federal government were directed against
Mormons in the Mormon Corridor, including the Utah War, Morrill Anti-Bigamy
Act, Poland Act, "Reynolds v. United States", Edmunds Act, and Edmunds-Tucker
Act. Madagascar. Queen Ranavalona I (reigned 1828‚Äì1861) issued a royal edict
prohibiting the practice of Christianity in Madagascar, expelled British
missionaries from the island, and sought to stem the growth of conversion to
Christianity within her realm. Approximately 60‚Äì80 Malagasy citizens were put
to death during this period as a consequence of their refusal to recant their
Christian faith. Far more, however, were punished in other ways: many were
required to undergo the "tangena" ordeal, while others were condemned to hard
labor or the confiscation of their land and property, and many of these
consequently died. The tangena ordeal was commonly administered to determine
the guilt or innocence of an accused person for any crime, including the
practice of Christianity, and involved ingestion of the poison contained within
the nut of the tangena tree ("Cerbera odollam"). Survivors were deemed
innocent, while those who perished were assumed guilty. Malagasy Christians
would remember this period as "ny tany maizina", or "the time when the land was
dark". Persecution of Christians intensified in 1840, 1849 and 1857; in 1849,
deemed the worst of these years by British missionary to Madagascar W.E.
Cummins (1878), 1,900 people were fined, jailed or otherwise punished in
relation to their Christian faith, including 18 executions. Spain. Anti-
Catholicism. Persecution of Catholics mostly, before and at the beginning, of
the Spanish Civil war (1936‚Äì1939), involved the murder of almost 7,000
priests and other clergy, as well as thousands of lay people, by sections of
nearly all the leftist groups because of their faith. The Republican government
which had come to power in Spain in 1931 was strongly anti-Catholic,
prohibiting religious education ‚Äì even in private school, prohibiting any
education by religious institutes, seizing Church property and expelling the
Jesuits from the country. On 3 June 1933 Pope Pius XI issued the encyclical
Dilectissima Nobis, in which he described the expropriation of all Church
buildings, episcopal residences, parish houses, seminaries and monasteries. By
law, they became property of the Spanish State, to which the Church had to pay
rent and taxes to continuously use these properties. "Thus the Catholic Church
is compelled to pay taxes on what was violently taken from her" Religious
vestments, liturgical instruments, statues, pictures, vases, gems and similar
objects necessary for worship were expropriated as well or desecrated. Numerous
churches and temples were destroyed by burning, after they were nationalized.
All private schools run by Catholic religious institutes were expropriated. The
purpose was to create solely secular schools there instead. Pope Pius XI, who
faced similar persecutions in the USSR and Mexico, called on Spanish Catholics
to defend themselves against the persecution with all legal means. During the
Spanish Civil War of 1936‚Äì1939, and especially in the early months of the
conflict, individual clergymen and entire religious communities were executed
by leftists, which included communists and anarchists. The death toll of the
clergy alone included 13 bishops, 4,172 diocesan priests and seminarians, 2,364
monks and friars and 283 nuns, for a total of 6,832 clerical victims. In
addition to murders of clergy and the faithful, destruction of churches and
desecration of sacred sites and objects were widespread. On the night of 19
July 1936 alone, some fifty churches were burned. In Barcelona, out of the 58
churches, only the Cathedral was spared, and similar desecrations occurred
almost everywhere in Republican Spain. Exceptions were Biscay and Guipuscoa
where the Christian Democratic Basque Nationalist Party, after some hesitation,
supported the Republic while halting persecution in the areas held by the
Basque Government. All Catholic churches in the Republican zone were closed.
The desecration was not limited to Catholic churches, as synagogues and
Protestant churches were also pillaged and closed. Some small Protestant
churches were spared. The terror has been called the "most extensive and
violent persecution of Catholicism in Western History, in some way even more
intense than that of the French Revolution." The persecution drove Catholics to
the Nationalists, even more than would have been expected, as these defended
their religious interests and survival. Anti-Protestantism. In Franco's
authoritarian Spanish State (1936‚Äì1975), Protestantism was deliberately
marginalized and persecuted. During the Civil War, Franco's regime persecuted
the country's 30,000 Protestants, and forced many Protestant pastors to leave
the country. Once authoritarian rule was established, non-Catholic Bibles were
confiscated by police and Protestant schools were closed. Although the 1945
Spanish Bill of Rights granted freedom of "private" worship, Protestants
suffered legal discrimination and non-Catholic religious services were not
permitted publicly, to the extent that they could not be in buildings which had
exterior signs indicating it was a house of worship and that public activities
were prohibited. While the Catholic Church was declared official and enjoyed a
close relation to the state, parts of the Basque clergy harbored nationalist
ideas opposed to Spanish centralism and were persecuted and imprisoned in a
"Concordate jail" reserved for criminal clergy. Nazi Germany. Hitler and the
Nazis had widespread support from traditional Christian communities, mainly due
to a common cause against the anti-religious German Bolsheviks. Once in power,
the Nazis moved to consolidate their power over the German churches and bring
them in line with Nazi ideals. Many historians say that Hitler had a general
covert plan, which some say existed even before the Nazis' rise to power, to
destroy Christianity within the Reich, which was to be accomplished through
control and subversion of the churches and to be completed after the war. The
Third Reich founded their own version of Christianity called Positive
Christianity which made major changes in its interpretation of the Bible which
said that Jesus Christ was the son of God, but was not a Jew and claimed that
Christ despised Jews, and that the Jews were the ones solely responsible for
Christ's death. Thus, the Nazi government consolidated religious power, using
allies to consolidate Protestant churches into the Protestant Reich Church. The
syncretist project of Positive Christianity was abandoned by 1940. Dissenting
Christians went underground and formed the Confessing Church, which was
persecuted as a subversive group by the Nazi government. Many of its leaders
were arrested and sent to concentration camps, and left the underground mostly
leaderless. Church members continued to engage in various forms of resistance,
including hiding Jews during the Holocaust and various attempts, largely
unsuccessful, to prod the Christian community to speak out on the part of the
Jews. The Catholic Church was suppressed in Poland. Between 1939 and 1945, an
estimated 3,000 members, 18% of the Polish clergy, were murdered; 1,992 of
which died in concentration camps. In the annexed territory of "Reichsgau
Wartheland", it was even harsher than elsewhere. Churches were systematically
closed, and most priests were either killed, imprisoned, or deported to the
General Government. The Germans also closed seminaries and convents persecuting
monks and nuns throughout Poland. In Pomerania, all but 20 of the 650 priests
were shot or sent to concentration camps. 80% of the Catholic clergy and five
of the bishops of Warthegau were sent to concentration camps in 1939. In the
city of Breslau ("Wroc≈Çaw"), 49% of its Catholic priests were killed, and in
Che≈Çmno, 48%. 108 of them are regarded as blessed martyrs. Among them,
Maximilian Kolbe was canonized as a saint. Not only were Polish Christians
persecuted by the Nazis, in the Dachau concentration camp alone, 2,600 Catholic
priests from 24 different countries were killed. Outside mainstream
Christianity, Jehovah's Witnesses were direct targets of the Holocaust, for
their refusal to swear allegiance to the Nazi government. Many Jehovah's
Witnesses were given the chance to deny their faith and swear allegiance to the
state, but few agreed. Over 12,000 Witnesses were sent to the concentration
camps, and estimated 2,500‚Äì5,000 died in the Holocaust. In the aftermath of
the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich, Nazi authorities repressed the
Czechoslovak Orthodox Church which had given aid to the assassins. After the
war ended, captured Nazi documents indicated that in the event of a Nazi
victory against the United Kingdom, German authorities would have outlawed the
Church of England and decimated its clergy. Jehovah's Witnesses. Since Charles
Taze Russell's Bible Students group had formed after the American Civil War
there was no formal position on military service till 1914, when the body came
out against military service. Jehovah's Witnesses are forbidden by their
religion to engage in violence, or to join the military. In Nazi Germany in the
1930s and early 1940s, Jehovah's Witnesses refused to renounce political
neutrality and were placed in concentration camps as a result. The Nazi
government gave detained Jehovah's Witnesses the option of release by signing a
document indicating renouncement of their faith, submission to state authority,
and support of the German military. Historian Hans Hesse said, "Some five
thousand Jehovah's Witnesses were sent to concentration camps where they alone
were 'voluntary prisoners', so termed because the moment they recanted their
views, they could be freed. Some lost their lives in the camps, but few
renounced their faith". Political and religious animosity against Jehovah's
Witnesses has at times led to mob action and government oppression in various
countries, including Cuba, the United States, Canada and Singapore. The
religion's doctrine of political neutrality has led to imprisonment of members
who refused conscription (for example in Britain during World War II and
afterwards during the period of compulsory national service). Current situation
(1989 to present). According to Pope Benedict XVI, Christians are the most
persecuted group in the contemporary world. According to the World Evangelical
Alliance, over 200 million Christians are denied fundamental human rights
solely because of their faith. Persecutions occur in North Korea, many Muslim
countries, India, China, Vietnam, and the Philippines. Muslim world.
Afghanistan. In Afghanistan, Abdul Rahman, a 41-year-old citizen, was charged
in 2006 with rejecting Islam (apostasy), a crime punishable by death under
Sharia law. He has since been released into exile in the West under intense
pressure from Western governments. In 2008, the Taliban killed a British
charity worker, Gayle Williams, "because she was working for an organisation
which was preaching Christianity in Afghanistan" even though she was extremely
careful not to try to convert Afghans. Algeria. On the night of 26‚Äì27 March
1996, seven monks from the monastery of Tibhirine in Algeria, belonging to the
Roman Catholic Trappist Order of Cistercians of the Strict Observance
(O.C.S.O.), were kidnapped in the Algerian Civil War. They were held for two
months, and were found dead on 21 May 1996. The circumstances of their
kidnapping and death remain controversial; the Armed Islamic Group (GIA) claims
responsibility for both, but the then French military attach√©, retired General
Francois Buchwalter, reports that they were accidentally killed by the Algerian
army in a rescue attempt, and claims have been made that the GIA itself was a
of Algeria's secret services (DRS). Islamists looted, and burned to the ground,
a Pentecostal church in Tizi Ouzou on 9 January 2010. The pastor was quoted as
saying that worshipers fled when local police left a gang of local rioters
unchecked. Egypt. While the Egyptian government does not have a policy to
persecute Christians, it discriminates against them and hampers their freedom
of worship. Its agencies sporadically persecute Muslim converts to
Christianity. The government enforces Hamayouni Decree restrictions on building
or repairing churches. These same restrictions, however, do not apply to
mosques. The government has effectively restricted Christians from senior
government, diplomatic, military, and educational positions, and there has been
increasing discrimination in the private sector. The government subsidizes
media which attack Christianity and restricts Christians access to the state-
controlled media. In Egypt the government does not officially recognize
conversions from Islam to Christianity; because certain interfaith marriages
are not allowed either, this prevents marriages between converts to
Christianity and those born in Christian communities, and also results in the
children of Christian converts being classified as Muslims and given a Muslim
education. The government also applies religiously discriminatory laws and
practices concerning clergy salaries. Foreign missionaries are allowed in the
country only if they restrict their activities to social improvements and
refrain from proselytizing. The Coptic Pope Shenouda III was internally exiled
in 1981 by President Anwar Sadat, who then chose five Coptic bishops and asked
them to choose a new pope. They refused, and in 1985 President Hosni Mubarak
restored Pope Shenouda III, who had been accused of fomenting interconfessional
strife. Particularly in Upper Egypt, the rise in extremist Islamist groups such
as the Gama'at Islamiya during the 1980s was accompanied by attacks on Copts
and on Coptic churches; these have since declined with the decline of those
organizations, but still continue. The police have been accused of siding with
the attackers in some of these cases. Many colleges dictate quotas for Coptic
students, often around 1 or 2% despite the group making up 15% of the country's
population. There is also a separate tax-funded education system called Al
Azhar, catering to students from elementary to college level, which accepts no
Christian Coptic students, teachers or administrators. Hundreds of Christian
Coptic girls have been kidnapped and forcibly converted to Islam, as well as
being victims of rape and forced marriage to Muslim men. On 2 January 2000, at
least 21 Christians were killed by Muslims in the Al Kosheh Massacres in
southern Egypt. Christian properties were also burned. In April 2006, one
person was killed and twelve injured in simultaneous knife attacks on three
Coptic churches in Alexandria. In November 2008, several thousand Muslims
attacked a Coptic church in a suburb of Cairo on the day of its inauguration,
forcing 800 Coptic Christians to barricade themselves in. In April 2009, two
Christian men were shot dead and another was injured by Muslim men after an
Easter vigil in the south of Egypt. On 18 September 2009, a Muslim man, Osama
Araban, beheaded a Coptic Christian man in the village of Bagour, and injured 2
others in 2 different villages. He was arrested the following day. On the eve
of 7 January 2010, Copts were going out of Mar-Yuhanna (St. John) church in Nag
Hammadi city when three Muslim men in a car near the church opened fire killing
8 Christians and injuring another 10. On 2011 New Year's Eve, as Christians
were leaving a Coptic Orthodox Church in the city of Alexandria after a New
Year's Eve service a car bomb exploded in front of the Church killing more than
20 and injuring more than 75. On 7 May 2011, an armed group of Islamists,
attacked and set fire to two churches including Saint Menas Coptic Orthodox
Christian Church and the Coptic Church of the Holy Virgin, in Cairo. The
attacks resulted in the deaths of 12 people and more than 230 wounded. It is
reported that the events were triggered by a mixed marriage between a Christian
woman and a Muslim man. In July 2012, Dahshur's entire Christian community,
which some estimate to be as many as 100 families, fled to nearby towns due to
sectarian violence. The violence began in a dispute over a badly ironed shirt,
which in turn escalated into a fight in which a Christian burned a Muslim to
death, which in turn sparked a rampage by angry Muslims, while the police
failed to act. At least 16 homes and properties of Christians were pillaged,
some were torched, and a church was damaged during the violence. Indonesia. In
January 1999 tens of thousands died when Muslim gunmen terrorized Christians
who had voted for independence in East Timor. In Indonesia, religious conflicts
have typically occurred in Western New Guinea, Maluku (particularly Ambon), and
Sulawesi. The presence of Muslims in these regions is in part a result of the
"transmigrasi" program of population re-distribution. Conflicts have often
occurred because of the aims of radical Islamist organizations such as Jemaah
Islamiah or Laskar Jihad to impose Sharia, with such groups attacking
Christians and destroying over 600 churches. In 2006 three Christian girls were
beheaded as retaliation for previous Muslim deaths in Christian-Muslim rioting.
The men were imprisoned for the murders, including Jemaah Islamiyah's district
ringleader Hasanuddin. On going to jail, Hasanuddin said, "It's not a problem
(if I am being sentenced to prison), because this is a part of our struggle."
Later on November 2011, another attack from Islamic community happen in Ambon.
Muslims set fire to several Christian houses, forcing the occupants to leave
the buildings. In December 2011, a second church in Bogor, West Java was
ordered to halt its activities by the local mayor. Another Catholic church had
been built there in 2005. Previously a Christian church, GKI Taman Yasmin, had
been sealed. Local authorities refused to lift a ban on the activities of the
church, despite an order from the Supreme Court of Indonesia. Local authorities
have persecuted the Christian church for three years. While the state has
ordered religious toleration, it has not enforced these orders. In Aceh
Province, the only province in Indonesia with autonomous Islamic Shari'a Law,
20 churches in Singkil Regency face threat of demolition due to gubernatorial
decree requires the approval of 150 worshippers, while the ministrial decree
also requires the approval of 60 local residents of different faiths. On 30
April 2012, all the 20 churches (17 Protestant churches, 2 Catholic churches
and one place of worship belonging to followers of a local nondenominational
faith) have been closed down by ordered from the Acting Regent which also
ordered members of the congregations to tear down the churches by themselves.
Most of the churches slated for demolition were built in 1930s and 1940s, and
now the regency only has 2 churches open, both built after 2000. Iran. Though
Iran recognizes Assyrian and Armenian Christians as ethnic and religious
minorities (along with Jews and Zoroastrians) and they have representatives in
the Parliament, after the 1979 Revolution, Muslim converts to Christianity
(typically to Protestant Christianity) have been arrested and sometimes
executed. Youcef Nadarkhani is an Iranian Christian pastor who was arrested on
charges of Apostasy in October 2009 and was subsequently sentenced to death. In
June 2011 the Iranian Supreme Court overruled his death sentence on condition
that he recant, which he refused to do. In a reversal on 8 of September 2012 he
was acquitted of the charges of apostasy and extortion, and sentenced to time
served for the charge of "propaganda against the regime," and immediately
released. Iraq. According to UNHCR, although Christians (almost exclusively
ethnic Assyrians and Armenians) represent less than 5% of the total Iraqi
population, they make up 40% of the refugees now living in nearby countries.
Northern Iraq remained predominantly Assyrian, Aramaic speaking and Christian
until the destructions of Tamerlane at the end of the 14th century. The
Assyrian Church of the East has its origin in what is now South East Turkey and
Assuristan (Sassanid Assyria). By the end of the 13th century there were twelve
Nestorian dioceses in a strip from Peking to Samarkand. When the 14th-century
Muslim warlord of Turco-Mongol descent, Timur (Tamerlane), conquered Persia,
Mesopotamia and Syria, the civilian population was decimated. Timur had 70,000
Assyrian Christians beheaded in Tikrit, and 90,000 more in Baghdad. In the 16th
century, Christians were half the population of Iraq. In 1987, the last Iraqi
census counted 1.4 million Christians. They were tolerated under the secular
regime of Saddam Hussein, who even made one of them, Tariq Aziz his deputy.
However persecution by Saddam Hussein continued against the Christians on an
ethnic, cultural and racial level, as the vast majority are Mesopotamian
Aramaic speaking Ethnic Assyrians (aka Chaldo-Assyrians). The Assyrian -Aramaic
language and written script was repressed, the giving of Hebraic/Aramaic
Christian names or Akkadian/Assyrio-Babylonian names forbidden(Tariq Aziz real
name is Michael Youhanna for example), and Saddam exploited religious
differences between Assyrian denominations such as Chaldean Catholics, Assyrian
Church of the East, Syriac Oryhodox and Ancient Church of the EastMany .
Assyrians were ethnically cleansed from their towns and villages under the
Anfal Campaign in 1988. Recently, Chaldo-Assyrian Christians have seen their
total numbers slump to about 500,000 to 800,000 today, of whom 250,000 live in
Baghdad. An exodus to the neighboring countries of Syria, Jordan and Turkey has
left behind closed parishes, seminaries and convents. As a small minority, who
until recently were without a militia of their own, Assyrian Christians have
been persecuted by both Shi‚Äôa and Sunni Muslim militias, Kurdish
Nationalists, and also by criminal gangs. Many Assyrian Christians are
departing for their ancestral heartlands in the Nineveh plains around Mosul.
Assyrian militias have recently been set up to protect villages and towns As of
21 June 2007, the UNHCR estimated that 2.2 million Iraqis had been displaced to
neighboring countries, and 2 million were displaced internally, with nearly
100,000 Iraqis fleeing to Syria and Jordan each month. A 25 May 2007 article
notes that in the past seven months only 69 people from Iraq have been granted
refugee status in the United States. In 2007, Chaldean Catholic priest Fr.
Ragheed Aziz Ganni and subdeacons Basman Yousef Daud, Wahid Hanna Isho, and
Gassan Isam Bidawed were killed in the ancient city of Mosul. Fr. Ragheed Aziz
Ganni was driving with his three deacons when they were stopped and demanded to
convert to Islam, when they refused they were shot. Six months later, the body
of Paulos Faraj Rahho, archbishop of Mosul, was found buried near Mosul. He was
kidnapped on 29 February 2008 when his bodyguards and driver were killed. In
2004, five churches were destroyed by bombing. Tens of thousands of Christians
fled the country. In 2010-11-01 was an attack on the "Our Lady of Salvation"
Syriac Catholic cathedral of Baghdad, Iraq, that took place during Sunday
evening Mass on 31 October 2010. The attack left at least 58 people dead, after
more than 100 had been taken hostage. The al-Qaeda-linked Sunni insurgent group
The Islamic State of Iraq claimed responsibility for the attack; though Shia
cleric Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani and Iraq's highest Catholic cleric condemned
the attack, amongst others. Lebanon. The war in Lebanon saw a number of
massacres of both Christians and Muslims. Among the earliest was the Damour
Massacre in 1976 when Palestinian militias attacked Christian civilians.
According to an eyewitness: The attack took place from the mountain behind "It
was an apocalypse," Father Mansour Labaky, a Christian Maronite priest who
survived the massacre at Damour: 'They were coming, thousands and thousands,
shouting "Allahu Akbar! (God is great!) Let us attack them for the Arabs, let
us offer a holocaust to Mohammad!", And they were slaughtering everyone in
their path, men, women and children.' The persecution in Lebanon combined
sectarian, political, ideological, and retaliation reasons. The Syrian regime
was also involved in persecuting Christians as well as Muslims in Lebanon. In
2002, a currently unidentified gunman killed Bonnie Penner Witherall at a
prenatal clinic in Sidon, Lebanon. She had been proselytizing and attempting to
convert Muslims to Christianity. Malaysia. In Malaysia, although Islam is the
official religion, Christianity is mostly tolerated. However, to be a member of
the majority race (the Malays), one is legally required to be a Muslim. If a
non-Muslim marries a Muslim, they are legally required to convert to Islam.
There has been a debate over whether Malaysia is a liberal Islamic state or a
very religious secular state. Christians are forbidden to proselytize Muslims.
Only Muslims are allowed to proselytize. In the 21st century, Christians have
been accused of proselytizing Muslims. Pakistan. In Pakistan 1.5% of the
population are Christian. Pakistani law mandates that "blasphemies" of the
Qur'an are to be met with punishment. Ayub , a Christian, was convicted of
blasphemy and sentenced to death in 1998. He was accused by a neighbor of
stating that he supported British writer Salman Rushdie, author of "The Satanic
Verses". Lower appeals courts upheld the conviction. However, before the
Pakistan Supreme Court, his lawyer was able to prove that the accuser had used
the conviction to force family off their land and then acquired control of the
property. has been released. In October 2001, gunmen on motorcycles opened fire
on a Protestant congregation in the Punjab, killing 18 people. The identify of
the gunmen are unknown. Officials think it might be a banned Islamic group. In
March 2002, five people were killed in an attack on a church in Islamabad,
including an American schoolgirl and her mother. In August 2002, masked gunmen
stormed a Christian missionary school for foreigners in Islamabad, six people
were killed and three injured. None of those killed were children of foreign
missionaries. In August 2002, grenades were thrown at a church in the grounds
of a Christian hospital in north-west Pakistan, near Islamabad, killing three
nurses. On 25 September 2002 two terrorists entered the "Peace and Justice
Institute", Karachi, where they separated Muslims from the Christians, and then
murdered seven Christians by shooting them in the head. All of the victims were
Pakistani Christians. Karachi police chief Tariq Jamil said the victims had
their hands tied and their mouths had been covered with tape. In December 2002,
three young girls were killed when hand grenade was thrown into a church near
Lahore on Christmas Day. In November 2005 3,000 militant Islamists attacked
Christians in Sangla Hill in Pakistan and destroyed Roman Catholic, Salvation
Army and United Presbyterian churches. The attack was over allegations of
violation of blasphemy laws by a Pakistani Christian named Yousaf . The attacks
were widely condemned by some political parties in Pakistan. On 5 June 2006 a
Pakistani Christian stonemason, Nasir Ashraf, was working near Lahore when he
drank water from a public facility using a glass chained to the facility. He
was assaulted by Muslims for "Polluting the glass". A mob developed, who beat
Ashraf, calling him a "Christian dog". Bystanders encouraged the beating and
joined in. Ashraf was eventually hospitalized. One year later, in August 2007,
a Christian missionary couple, Rev. Arif and Kathleen Khan, were gunned down by
militant Islamists in Islamabad. Pakistani police believed that the murders was
committed by a member of Khan's parish over alleged sexual harassment by Khan.
This assertion is widely doubted by Khan's family as well as by Pakistani
Christians. In August 2009, six Christians, including 4 women and a child, were
burnt alive by Muslim militants and a church set ablaze in Gojra, Pakistan when
violence broke out after alleged desecration of a Qur'an in a wedding ceremony
by Christians. On 8 November 2010, a Christian woman from Punjab Province, Asia
Noreen Bibi, was sentenced to death by hanging for violating Pakistan's
blasphemy law. The accusation stemmed from a 2009 incident in which Bibi became
involved in a religious argument after offering water to thirsty Muslim farm
workers. The workers later claimed that she had blasphemed the Prophet
Muhammed. As of 8 April 2011, Bibi is in solitary confinement. Her family has
fled. No one in Pakistan convicted of blasphemy has ever been executed. A
cleric has offered $5,800 to anyone who kills her. On 2 March 2011, the only
Christian Minister in the Pakistan government was shot dead. Shahbaz Bhatti,
Minister for Minorities, was in his car along with his niece. Around 50 bullets
struck the car. Over 10 bullets hit Bhatti. Before his death he had publicly
stated that he was not afraid of the Taliban's threats and was willing to die
for his faith and beliefs. He was targeted for opposing the anti-free speech
"blasphemy" law, which punishes insulting Islam or its Prophet. A
fundamentalist Muslim group claimed responsibility. Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia
is an Islamic state that practices Wahhabism and restricts all other religions,
including the possession of religious items such as the Bible, crucifixes, and
Stars of David. Christians are arrested and lashed in public for practicing
their faith openly. Strict sharia is enforced. Muslims are forbidden to convert
to another religion. If one does so and does not recant, they may be executed.
Somalia. In Somalia 25 November 2010 Nurta Mohamed Farah, age 17. was shot and
killed after fleeing her parents home where she had endured much torture and
drugging, by them, in hopes that she would renounce her faith in Jesus Christ.
Sudan. In Sudan, it is estimated that over 1.5 million Christians have been
killed by the Janjaweed, the Arab Muslim militia, and even suspected Islamists
in northern Sudan since 1984. It should also be noted that Sudan's several
civil wars (which often take the form of genocidal campaigns) are often not
only or purely religious in nature, but also ethnic, as many black Muslims, as
well as Muslim Arab tribesmen, have also been killed in the conflicts. It is
estimated that as many as 200,000 people had been taken into slavery during the
Second Sudanese Civil War. The slaves are mostly Dinka people. Tunisia. Since
the Tunisian revolution of 2011, there has been religious violence consisting
of Muslim attacks on Christians in Tunisia. Turkey. In modern Turkey, the
Istanbul pogrom was a state-sponsored and state-orchestrated pogrom that
compelled Greek Christians to leave Istanbul, the first Christian city in
violation to the Treaty of Lausanne (see Istanbul Pogrom). The issue of
Christian genocides by the Turks may become a problem, since Turkey wishes to
join the European Union. The Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople is still
in a difficult position. Turkey requires by law that the Ecumenical Patriarch
must be an ethnic Greek, holding Turkish citizenship by birth, although most of
the Greek minority has been expelled. The state's expropriation of church
property and the closing of the Orthodox Theological School of Halki are also
difficulties faced by the Church of Constantinople. Despite appeals from the
United States, the European Union and various governmental and non-governmental
organizations, the School remains closed since 1971. In November 2007, a 17th
century chapel of "Our Lord's Transfiguration" at the Halki seminary was almost
totally demolished by the Turkish forestry authority. There was no advanced
warning given for the demolition work and it was only stopped after appeals by
the Ecumenical Patriarch. Persecution of Christians has continued in modern
Turkey. On 5 February 2006, the Catholic priest Andrea Santoro was murdered in
Trabzon by a student influenced by the reactions following the Jyllands-Posten
Muhammad cartoons controversy. On 18 April 2007, 3 Christians were murdered in
the bible publishing firm in Malatya, coincidentally, the hometown of Mehmet
Ali Aƒüca, the assassin who shot and wounded Pope John Paul II on 13 May 1981.
In December 2007, Adriano Franchini, a catholic priest of the Capuchin order in
Turkey, was stabbed in the stomach after Sunday mass. Franchini led the church
of the Virgin Mary in Ephesus. Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. Turkey
invaded Cyprus in 1974. The United Nations has documented their systematic
destruction of churches of the Church of Cyprus from 1974 though 2003. Many
churches were vandalized and their artifacts stolen. Church mosaics and
frescoes were removed and ended up in Europe‚Äôs black market or sold openly in
specialist stores and auction-houses. Some churches were demolished and some
have had their use changed to mosques and stables. Yemen. Three Christian
missionaries were killed in their hospital in Jibla, Yemen in December 2002. A
gunman, apprehended by the authorities, said that he did it "for his religion."
Other countries with large Muslim populations. India. Muslims in India who
convert to Christianity have been subjected to harassment, intimidation, and
attacks by Muslims. In Jammu and Kashmir, the only Indian state with a Muslim
majority, a Christian convert and missionary, Bashir Tantray, was killed,
allegedly by militant Islamists in 2006. A Christian priest, K.K. Alavi, a 1970
convert from Islam, thereby raised the ire of his former Muslim community and
received many death threats. An Islamic terrorist group named "The National
Development Front" actively campaigned against him. In the southern state of
India, Kerala, Islamic Terrorists chopped off the hand of Professor T.J.Joseph
due to allegation of blasphemy of prophet. Nigeria. In the 11 Northern states
of Nigeria that have introduced the Islamic system of law, the Sharia,
sectarian clashes between Muslims and Christians have resulted in many deaths,
and some churches have been burned. More than 30,000 Christians were displaced
from their homes Kano, the largest city in northern Nigeria. Boko Haram
conducts terrorist attacks against Christians. Philippines. In the Philippines,
the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and Abu Sayyaf has attacked and killed
Christians. Hindu extremism in India. The Sangh Parivar and related
organisations have stated that the violence is an expression of "spontaneous
anger" of "vanvasis" against "forcible conversion" activities undertaken by
missionaries. These claims have been disputed by Christians a belief described
as mythical and propaganda by Sangh Parivar; the Parivar objects in any case to
all conversions as a "threat to national unity". Religious scholar Cyril
Veliath of Sophia University stated that the Hindu attacks on Christians were
the work of individuals motivated by "disgruntled politicians or phony
religious leaders" and where religion is concerned the typical Hindu is an
"exceptionally amicable and tolerant person (...) Hinduism as a religion could
well be one of the most accommodating in the world. Rather than confront and
destroy, it has a tendency to welcome and assimilate." According to Rudolf C
Heredia, religious conversion was a critical issue even before the creation of
the modern state. Whereas Nehru wanted to establish a "a secular state in a
religious society" Gandhi opposed the Christian missionaries calling them as
the remnants of colonial Western culture. He claimed that by converting into
Christianity, Hindus have changed their nationality. In its controversial
annual human rights reports for 1999, the United States Department of State
criticised India for "increasing societal violence against Christians." The
report listed over 90 incidents of anti-Christian violence, ranging from damage
of religious property to violence against Christians pilgrims. In 1997, twenty-
four such incidents were reported. Recent waves of anti-conversion laws in
various Indian states passed by some states is claimed to be a gradual and
continuous institutionalization of Hindutva by the Bureau of Democracy, Human
Rights and Labour of the US State Department. In July 2006, Madhya Pradesh
government passed legislation requiring people who desire to convert to a
different religion to provide the government with one-month's notice, or face
fines and penalties. In August 2006, the Chhattisgarh State Assembly passed
similar legislation requiring anyone who desires to convert to another religion
to give 30 days' notice to the district magistrate. China. The communist
government of the People's Republic of China tries to maintain tight control
over all religions, so the only legal Christian Churches (Three-Self Patriotic
Movement and Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association) are those under the
Communist Party of China control. Churches which are not controlled by the
government are shut down, and their members are imprisoned. In 2009, Christians
must worship in registered, regulated churches. According to the Jubilee
Campaign, an interdenominational lobby group, about 300 Christians caught
attending unregistered "house churches" were in jail in 2004. Gong Shengliang,
head of the South China Church, was sentenced to death in 2001. Although his
sentence was commuted to a jail sentence, Amnesty International reports that he
has been tortured. North Korea. North Korea leads the list of 50 countries
where Christians are persecuted at current time according to a watch list by
Open Doors. Indochina region. The establishment of French Indochina once led to
a high Christian population. Regime changes throughout the 19th and 20th
centuries led to some increased persecution of minority religious groups.
Killings, torture or imprisonment and forced starvation of local groups are
common in parts of Vietnam and Laos, especially in more recent years.
