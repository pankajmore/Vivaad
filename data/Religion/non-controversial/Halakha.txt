Halakha Halakha () (Sephardic ) â€”also transliterated Halocho (Ashkenazic ),
or Halachaâ€”is the collective body of religious laws for Jews, including
biblical law (the 613 "mitzvot") and later talmudic and rabbinic law, as well
as customs and traditions. Judaism classically draws no distinction in its laws
between religious and ostensibly non-religious life; Jewish religious tradition
does not distinguish clearly between religious, national, racial, or ethnic
identities. "Halakha" guides not only religious practices and beliefs, but
numerous aspects of day-to-day life. "Halakha" is often translated as "Jewish
Law", although a more literal translation might be "the path" or "the way of
walking". The word derives from the Shoresh that means "to go" or "to walk".
Historically in the diaspora, "Halakha" served many Jewish communities as an
enforceable avenue of civil and religious law. Since the Age of Enlightenment,
emancipation, and "haskalah" in the modern era, Jewish citizens are bound to
"Halakha" only by their voluntary consent. Under contemporary Israeli law,
however, certain areas of Israeli family and personal status law are under the
authority of the rabbinic courts and are therefore treated according to
"Halakha". Some differences in "Halakha" itself are found among Ashkenazi,
Mizrahi, Sephardi, and Yemenite Jews, which are reflective of the historic and
geographic diversity of various Jewish communities within the Diaspora.
Etymology and terminology. The name "Halakha" is derived from the Hebrew
"halakh" ×”Ö¸×œÖ·×šÖ°, which means "to walk" or "to go"; thus a literal
translation does not yield "law", but rather "the way to go". The term Halakha
may refer to a single law, to the literary corpus of rabbinic legal texts, or
to the overall system of religious law. "Halakha" is often contrasted with
"Aggadah", the diverse corpus of rabbinic exegetical, narrative, philosophical,
mystical, and other "non-legal" literatures. At the same time, since writers of
"Halakha" may draw upon the aggadic and even mystical literature, there is a
dynamic interchange between the genres. Halakha constitutes the practical
application of the 613 "mitzvot" ("commandments", singular: "mitzvah") in the
Torah, (the five books of Moses, the "Written Law") as developed through
discussion and debate in the classical rabbinic literature, especially the
Mishnah and the Talmud (the "Oral law"), and as codified in the Mishneh Torah
or Shulchan Aruch (the Jewish "Code of Law".) The Halakha is a comprehensive
guide to all aspects of human life, both corporeal and spiritual. Its laws,
guidelines, and opinions cover a vast range of situations and principles, in
the attempt to realize what is implied by the central Biblical commandment to
"be holy as I your God am holy". They cover what are claimed to better ways for
a Jew to live, based on what is not stated, but has been derived from the
Hebrew Bible. Because Halakha is developed and applied by various halakhic
authorities, rather than one sole "official voice", different individuals and
communities may well have different answers to halakhic questions.
Controversies lend rabbinic literature much of its creative and intellectual
appeal. With few exceptions, controversies are not settled through
authoritative structures because during the age of exile Jews have lacked a
single judicial hierarchy or appellate review process for Halakha. Instead,
Jews interested in observing Halakha typically choose to follow specific rabbis
or affiliate with a more tightly structured community. Halakha has been
developed and pored over throughout the generations since before 500 BCE, in a
constantly expanding collection of religious literature consolidated in the
Talmud. First and foremost it forms a body of intricate judicial opinions,
legislation, customs, and recommendations, many of them passed down over the
centuries, and an assortment of ingrained behaviors, relayed to successive
generations from the moment a child begins to speak. It is also the subject of
intense study in "yeshivas"; see Torah study. Laws of the Torah. Broadly, the
Halakha comprises the practical application of the commandments (each one known
as a mitzvah) in the Torah, as developed in subsequent rabbinic literature; see
The Mitzvot and Jewish Law. According to the Talmud (Tractate Makot), there are
613 mitzvot ("commandments") in the Torah; in Hebrew these are known as the
"Taryag mitzvot" ×ª×¨×™"×’ ×ž×¦×•×•×ª. There are 248 positive mitzvot and 365
negative mitzvot given in the Torah, supplemented by seven mitzvot legislated
by the rabbis of antiquity; see Rabbinical commandments. Categories. Jewish law
may be categorized in various ways. Besides the basic categories applied to the
mitzvot in antiquity, during the medieval period Jewish law was classified by
such works as Maimonides' "Mishneh Torah" and Joseph Karo's Shulchan Aruch.
This division between revealed and rabbinic commandments (mitzvot) may
influence the importance of a rule, its enforcement and the nature of its
ongoing interpretation. Halakhic authorities may disagree on which laws fall
into which categories or the circumstances (if any) under which prior Rabbinic
rulings can be re-examined by contemporary rabbis, but all halakhic Jews hold
that both categories exist and that the first category is immutable, with
exceptions only for life-saving and similar emergency circumstances. A second
classical distinction is between the Written Torah (laws written in the Hebrew
Bible, specifically its first five books), and Oral Law, laws believed
transmitted orally prior to compilation in texts such as the Mishnah, Talmud,
and Rabbinic codes. Commandments are divided into positive and negative
commands, which are treated differently in terms of divine and human
punishment. Positive commandments (of which tradition holds there are 248)
"require" an action to be performed and are considered to bring the performer
closer to God. Negative commandments (traditionally 365 in number) "forbid" a
specific action, and violations create a distance from God. In striving to "be
holy" as God is holy, a person attempts so far as possible to live in
accordance with God's wishes for humanity, striving to more completely live
with each of these with every moment of one's life. A further division is made
between "chukim" ("decrees" â€” laws without obvious explanation, such as
"shatnez", the law prohibiting wearing clothing made of mixtures of linen and
wool), "mishpatim" ("judgments" â€” laws with obvious social implications) and
"eduyot" ("testimonies" or "commemorations", such as the Shabbat and holidays).
Through the ages, various rabbinical authorities have classified the
commandments in various other ways. There is a notion in halakha that
violations of the latter are more severe, in certain ways, because of the
requirement that one must obtain forgiveness both from the offended person and
from God. As a practical matter, the mitzvot also may be classified in line
with how they might be implemented after the destruction of the Temple. Some
mitzvot are relevant only in the Land of Israel. Many laws pertaining to
holiness and purity can no longer be performed as the holy Sanctuary in
Jerusalem no longer exists. Some laws require a kind of beit din (Jewish court)
that no longer exists. Within Talmudic literature, Jewish law is divided into
the six orders of the Mishnah, which are categories by proximate subject
matter: Zeraim ("Seeds") for agricultural laws and prayer, Moed ("Festival"),
for the Sabbath and the Festivals, Nashim ("Women"), dealing primarily with
marriage and divorce, Nezikin ("Damages"), for civil and criminal law, Kodashim
("Holy things"), for sacrifices and the dietary laws, and Tohorot ("Purities")
for ritual purity. However, Talmudic texts often deal with laws outside these
apparent subject categories. As a result, Jewish law came to be categorized in
other ways in the post-Talmudic period. In the major codes of Jewish law, two
other main categorization schemes are found. Maimonides' "Mishneh Torah"
divides the laws into fourteen sections. The codification efforts that
culminated in the Shulchan Aruch divide the law into four sections, including
only laws that do not depend on being in the Land of Israel. Sin. Judaism
regards the violation of the commandments, the "mitzvot", to be a sin.
Relatedly, the three terms - "Chayyav, Patur, Mutar" - in the Gemara and
halakhic codes classify the permissibility of an action or the severity of its
prohibition and punishment. Judaism understands that the vast majority of
people, aside from those who are termed Tzadikim Gemurim (Hebrew: ×¦×“×™×§,
"the righteous"), will succumb to sin in their lives. However, a state of sin
does not condemn a person to damnation; there is always a road of "teshuva"
(Hebrew: ×ª×©×•×‘×”; repentance, literally: "return"). There are some classes
of people for whom this is exceedingly difficult, such as those who commit
adultery, as well as those who slander others. In earlier days, when Jews had a
functioning court system (the beth din and the Sanhedrin high court), courts
were empowered to administer physical punishments for various violations, upon
conviction by far stricter standards of evidence than are acceptable in courts
in modern democracies: execution, corporal punishment, incarceration,
excommunication. Since the fall of the Temple, executions have been forbidden.
Since the fall of the autonomous Jewish communities of Europe, the other
punishments also have been discontinued. Today, then, one's accounts are
reckoned solely by God. The Talmud says that although courts capable of
executing sinners no longer exist, the prescribed penalties continue to be
applied by Providence. For instance, someone who has committed a sin punishable
by stoning might fall off a roof, or someone who ought to be executed by
strangulation might drown. Gentiles and Jewish law. The details of these laws
are codified from the Talmudic texts in the Mishneh Torah. They can be found
mainly in chapters 9 and 10 of Hilkhoth Melakhim u'Milhamothehem in Sefer
Shoftim, the fourteenth book of the Mishneh Torah. Sources and process. In
antiquity, the "Sanhedrin" functioned essentially as the Supreme Court and
legislature for Judaism, and had the power to administer binding law, including
both received law and its own Rabbinic decrees, on all Jews â€” rulings of the
Sanhedrin became Halakha; see Oral law. That court ceased to function in its
full mode in CE 40. Today, the authoritative application of Jewish law is left
to the local rabbi, and the local rabbinical courts, with only local
applicability. In branches of Judaism that follow halakha, lay individuals make
numerous ad-hoc decisions, but are regarded as not having authority to decide
definitively. Since the days of the Sanhedrin, however, no body or authority
has been generally regarded as having the authority to create universally
recognized precedents. As a result, Halakha has developed in a somewhat
different fashion from Anglo-American legal systems with a Supreme Court able
to provide universally accepted precedents. Generally, contemporary halakhic
arguments are effectively, yet unofficially, peer-reviewed. When a rabbinic
"posek" ("decisor") proposes a new interpretation of a law, that interpretation
may be considered binding for the posek's questioner or immediate community.
Depending on the stature of the posek and the quality of the decision, an
interpretation may also be gradually accepted by rabbis and members of similar
Jewish communities. Under this system, there is a tension between the relevance
of earlier and later authorities in constraining halakhic interpretation and
innovation. On the one hand, there is a principle in Halakha not to overrule a
specific law from an earlier era, after it got accepted by the community as a
law or vow. On the other hand, another principle recognizes the responsibility
and authority of later authorities, and especially the "posek" handling a
concurrent question. In addition, the Halakha embodies a wide range of
principles that permit judicial discretion and deviation (Ben-Menahem).
Generally speaking, a rabbi in any one period will not overrule specific laws
from an earlier era, unless supported by a relevant earlier precedent; see list
below. There are important exceptions to this principle, which empower the
"posek" (decisor) or "beth din" (court) responsible for a given opinion.
Notwithstanding the potential for innovation, rabbis and Jewish communities
differ greatly on how they make changes in Halakha. Notably, "poskim"
frequently extend the application of a law to new situations, but do not
consider such applications as constituting a "change" in Halakha. For example,
many Orthodox rulings concerning electricity are derived from rulings
concerning fire, as electricity is deemed to be a form of fire. In contrast,
Conservative Poskim consider that switching on electrical equipment is
physically and chemically more like turning on a water tap (which is
permissible) than lighting a fire (which is not permissible), and therefore
permitted on Shabbat. The reformative Conservative Judaism, in some cases,
explicitly interprets Halakha to take into account its view of contemporary
society. For instance, most Conservative rabbis extend the application of
certain Jewish obligations and permissible activities to women. See below: How
Halakha is viewed today. Within certain Jewish communities, formal organized
bodies do exist. Within Modern Orthodox Judaism, there is no one committee or
leader, but Modern Orthodox rabbis generally agree with the views set by
consensus by the leaders of the Rabbinical Council of America. Within
Conservative Judaism, the Rabbinical Assembly has an official Committee on
Jewish Law and Standards. Takkanot. However, in common parlance sometimes
people use the general term "takkanah" to refer either gezeirot or takkanot.
Takkanot, in general, do not affect or restrict observance of Torah "mitzvot".
However, the Talmud states that in exceptional cases, the Sages had the
authority to "uproot matters from the Torah" in certain cases. In Talmudic and
classical halakhic literature, this authority refers to the authority to
prohibit some things that would otherwise be biblically sanctioned ("shev v'al
ta'aseh"). Rabbis may rule that a Torah mitzvah should not be performed, e.g.
blowing the shofar on Shabbat, or taking the lulav and etrog on Shabbat. These
takkanot are executed out of fear that some might otherwise carry the mentioned
items between home and the synagogue, thus inadvertently violating a Sabbath
melakha. Another rare and limited form of takkanah involved overriding Torah
prohibitions. In some cases, the Sages allowed the temporary violation of a
prohibition in order to maintain the Jewish system as a whole. This was part of
the basis for Esther's relationship with Ahasuerus. (Sanhedrin) For general
usage of takkanaot in Jewish history see the article Takkanah. For examples of
this being used in Conservative Judaism see Conservative Halakha. Rules by
which early Jewish law was derived. The last-mentioned rules are contained in
an independent baraita, which has been incorporated and preserved only in later
works. They are intended for haggadic interpretation; but many of them are
valid for the Halakah as well, coinciding with the rules of Hillel and Ishmael.
Neither Hillel, Ishmael, nor Eliezer ben Jose ha-Gelili sought to give a
complete enumeration of the rules of interpretation current in his day, but
they omitted from their collections many rules that were then followed. They
restricted themselves to a compilation of the principal methods of logical
deduction, which they called "middot" (measures), although the other rules also
were known by that term (comp. Midrash Sifre, Numbers 2 Friedmann, p.Â 2a).
Historical analysis. The antiquity of the rules can be determined only by the
dates of the authorities who quote them; in general, they can not safely be
declared older than the tanna to whom they are first ascribed. It is certain,
however, that the seven middot of Hillel and the thirteen of Ishmael are
earlier than the time of Hillel himself, who was the first to transmit them.
The Talmud itself gives no information concerning the origin of the middot,
although the Geonim regarded them as Sinaitic. Modern historians believe that
it is decidedly erroneous to consider the middot as traditional from the time
of Moses on Sinai. The middot seem to have been first laid down as abstract
rules by the teachers of Hillel, though they were not immediately recognized by
all as valid and binding. Different schools interpreted and modified them,
restricted or expanded them, in various ways. Akiba and Ishmael and their
scholars especially contributed to the development or establishment of these
rules. Akiba devoted his attention particularly to the grammatical and
exegetical rules, while Ishmael developed the logical. The rules laid down by
one school were frequently rejected by another because the principles that
guided them in their respective formulations were essentially different.
According to Akiba, the divine language of the Torah is distinguished from the
speech of men by the fact that in the former no word or sound is superfluous.
Some scholars have observed a similarity between these rabbinic rules of
interpretation and the hermeneutics of ancient Hellenistic culture. For
example, Saul Lieberman argues that the *names* (e.g. "kal vahomer") of Rabbi
Ishmael's "middot" are Hebrew translations of Greek terms, although the methods
of those "middot" are not Greek in origin. Views today. Orthodox Judaism holds
that Halakha is the divine law as laid out in the Torah (five books of Moses),
rabbinical laws, rabbinical decrees and customs combined. The rabbis, who made
many additions and interpretations of Jewish Law, did so only in accordance
with regulations they believe were given for this purpose to Moses on Mount
Sinai, see Deuteronomy 17:11. See Orthodox Judaism, Beliefs about Jewish law
and tradition. Conservative Judaism holds that Halakha is normative and
binding, and is developed as a partnership between people and God based on
Sinaitic Torah. While there are a wide variety of Conservative views, a common
belief is that Halakha is, and has always been, an evolving process subject to
interpretation by rabbis in every time period. See Conservative Judaism,
Beliefs. Reform Judaism and Reconstructionist Judaism both hold that modern
views of how the Torah and rabbinic law developed imply that the body of
rabbinic Jewish law is no longer normative (seen as binding) on Jews today.
Those in the traditionalist wing of these movements believe that the halakha
represents a personal starting-point, holding that each Jew is obligated to
interpret the Torah, Talmud and other Jewish works for themselves, and this
interpretation will create separate commandments for each person. Those in the
liberal and classical wings of Reform believe that in this day and era most
Jewish religious rituals are no longer necessary, and many hold that following
most Jewish laws is actually counterproductive. They propose that Judaism has
entered a phase of ethical monotheism, and that the laws of Judaism are only
remnants of an earlier stage of religious evolution, and need not be followed.
This is considered wrong, and even heretical, by Orthodox and Conservative
Judaism. Humanistic Jews value the Torah as a historical, political, and
sociological text written by their ancestors. They do not believe "that every
word of the Torah is true, or even morally correct, just because the Torah is
old". The Torah is both disagreed with and questioned. Humanistic Jews believe
that the entire Jewish experience, and not only the Torah, should be studied as
a source for Jewish behavior and ethical values. Flexibility. Despite its
internal rigidity, halakha has generally been a flexible system, addressing
issues on the basis of circumstance and precedent. The classical approach has
permitted new rulings regarding modern technology. These rulings guide the
observant about the proper use of electricity on the Sabbath and holidays
within the parameters of halakhah. Indeed, many scholarly tomes have been
published and are constantly being reviewed ensuring the maximum coordination
between electrical appliances and technology with the needs of the religiously
observant Jew, with a great range of opinions. Often, as to the applicability
of the law in any given situation, the proviso is to "consult your local rabbi
or posek". Modern critics, however, have charged that with the rise of
movements that challenge the "divine" authority of halakha, traditional Jews
have greater reluctance to change, not only the laws themselves but also other
customs and habits, than traditional Rabbinical Judaism did prior to the advent
of Reform in the 19th century. Differences between Orthodox and Conservative
Judaism. Orthodox Jews maintain Halakha is derived from the divine law of the
Torah (Bible), rabbinical laws, rabbinical decrees and customs combined. As
such it should be adhered to as an unalterable authority. They also believe
there are traditional formulas that date back to Moses on how the divine law
may be interpreted - see above, "Rules by which early Jewish law was derived".
While Conservative Jews have varied views regarding the origin of the Torah and
its authority today, and believe it can be continuously reinterpreted. Their
view of Halakha has given rise to substantial differences in approach as well
as result. Orthodox Judaism. Orthodox Jews believe that Halakha is a religious
system, whose core represents the revealed will of God. Although Orthodox
Judaism acknowledges that rabbis made many decisions and decrees regarding
Jewish Law where the written Torah itself is non-specific, they did so only in
accordance with regulations given to them by Moses on Mount Sinai (see
Deuteronomy 5:8-13). These regulations were transmitted orally until shortly
after the destruction of the second temple. They were then recorded in the
Mishnah, and explained in the Talmud and commentaries throughout history,
including today. Orthodox Judaism believes that subsequent interpretations have
been derived with the utmost accuracy and care. The most widely accepted codes
of Jewish law are known as Mishneh Torah and the Shulchan Aruch. No rabbi has
the right to change Jewish law unless they clearly understand how it coincides
with the precepts of the Talmud and later codes of Jewish law. Later
commentaries were accepted by many rabbis as final rule, however, other rabbis
may disagree. Orthodox Judaism has a range of opinions on the circumstances and
extent to which change is permissible. Haredi Jews generally hold that even
"minhagim" (customs) must be retained and existing precedents cannot be
reconsidered. Modern Orthodox authorities are generally more inclined to permit
limited changes in customs, and some reconsideration of precedent. All Orthodox
authorities, however, agree that only later Rabbinical interpretations are
subject to reconsideration, and hold that core sources of Divine written and
oral law, such as the Torah the Mishnah and the Talmud, cannot be overridden.
Conservative Judaism. The view held by Conservative Judaism is that while God
is real, the Torah is not the word of God in a literal sense. However, in this
view the Torah is still held as mankind's record of its understanding of God's
revelation, and thus still has divine authority. In this view, traditional
Jewish law is still seen as binding. Jews who hold to this view generally try
to use modern methods of historical study to learn how Jewish law has changed
over time, and are in some cases more willing to change Jewish law in the
present. A key practical difference between Conservative and Orthodox
approaches is that Conservative Judaism holds that its Rabbinical body's powers
are not limited to reconsidering later precedents based on earlier sources, but
the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards (CJLS) is empowered to override
Biblical and Taanitic prohibitions by "takkanah" (decree) when perceived to be
inconsistent with modern requirements and/or views of ethics. The CJLS has used
this power on a number of occasions, most famously in the "driving teshuva",
which says that if someone is unable to walk to any synagogue on the Sabbath,
and their commitment to observance is so loose that not attending synagogue may
lead them to drop it altogether, their rabbi may give them a dispensation to
drive there and back; and more recently in its decision prohibiting the taking
of evidence on Mamzer status on the grounds that implementing such a status is
immoral. The CJLS has also held that the Talmudic concept of "Kavod HaBriyot"
permits lifting rabbinic decrees (as distinct from carving narrow exceptions)
on grounds of human dignity, and used this principle in a December 2006 opinion
lifting all rabbinic prohibitions on homosexual conduct (the opinion held that
only male-male anal sex was forbidden by the Bible and that this remained
prohibited). Conservative Judaism also made a number of changes to the role of
women in Judaism, including counting women in the minyan and ordaining women as
rabbis. The latter was accomplished by simple vote on the faculty of the JTS.
Orthodox Judaism holds that "takkanot" (Rabbinical decrees) can only supplement
and can never nullify Biblical law, and significant decisions must be
accompanied by scholarly responsa citing sources and halakhic precedent. The
responsum cited several examples of how, in Spitz's view, the Rabbinic Sages
declined to enforce punishments explicitly mandated by Torah law. The examples
include the "trial of the accused adulteress (Sotah)", the "Law of the Breaking
of the Neck of the Heifer" and the application of the death penalty for the
"rebellious child". Spitz argues that the punishment of the Mamzer has been
effectively inoperative for nearly two thousand years due to deliberate
rabbinic inaction (with a few rule-proving counterexamples, including the 18th
century Orthodox rabbi Ismael ha-Kohen of Modena, who decreed that a child
should have the word "mamzer" tattooed to his forehead). Further he suggested
that the Rabbis have long regarded the punishment declared by the Torah as
immoral, and came to the conclusion that no court should agree to hear
testimony on "mamzerut". His motion was passed by the CJLS. The decision
represented a watershed for Conservative Judaism because it represented an
explicit abrogation of a Biblical injunction on the grounds of contemporary
morality, as distinct from exigency. The dissenters, who included Rabbi Joel
Roth as well as a partial concurrence by Rabbi Daniel Nevins, argued for
reaffirming the classical halakhic framework in which human decrees inform and
often limit but never wholly abrogate law believed to be of Divine origin,
stating that "we should acknowledge that God's law is beyond our authority to
eliminate", but should continue the traditional approach of applying strict
evidentiary rules and presumptions that tend to render enforcement unlikely. He
also argued that the current framework is moral, both because proving mamzer
status sufficiently beyond all doubt is already so difficult that it is rare,
and because the mere existence and possibility of mamzerut status, even if
rarely enforced, creates an important incentive for divorcing parties to obtain
a get (Jewish religious divorce) to avoid the sin of adultery. He cited a
responsum by prominent Haredi Orthodox Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef as an example of how
the traditional approach works. Rabbi Yosef was faced with the child of a woman
who had left a religious marriage without religious divorce and had a child in
the second marriage, seemingly an open-and-shut case of Mamzer status. Rabbi
Yosef proceeded to systematically discredit the evidence that the former
marriage had ever taken place. The Ketubah was mysteriously not found and hence
disqualified, and the officiating Rabbi's testimony was never sufficiently
corroborated and hence not credible. Rabbi Yosef then found reason to doubt
that the new husband was ever the father, finding that because the ex-husband
occasionally delivered alimony personally, an ancient presumption (one of many)
that any time a husband and wife are alone together the law presumes
intercourse has taken place governed the case. He held that Jewish law could
not disprove, and hence had to conclude, that the original husband really was
the child's father and there was no case of Mamzer status. Codes of Jewish law.
The Torah and the Talmud are not formal codes of law: they are sources of law.
There are many formal codes of Jewish law that have developed over the past two
thousand years. These codes have influenced, and in turn, have been influenced
by, the responsa; History of Responsa thus provides an informative complement
to the survey below.
