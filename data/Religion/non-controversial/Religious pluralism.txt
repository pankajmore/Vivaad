Religious pluralism Definition and scope. Religious pluralism, to paraphrase
the title of a recent academic work, goes beyond mere toleration. Chris Beneke,
in "Beyond Toleration: The Religious Origins of American Pluralism", explains
the difference between religious tolerance and religious pluralism by pointing
to the situation in the late 18th century United States. By the 1730s, in most
colonies religious minorities had obtained what contemporaries called religious
toleration: "The policy of toleration relieved religious minorities of some
physical punishments and some financial burdens, but it did not make them free
from the indignities of prejudice and exclusion. Nor did it make them equal.
Those 'tolerated' could still be barred from civil offices, military positions,
and university posts." In short, religious toleration is only the absence of
religious persecution, and does not necessarily preclude religious
discrimination. However, in the following decades something extraordinary
happened in the Thirteen Colonies, at least if one views the events from "a
late eighteenth-century perspective." Gradually the colonial governments
expanded the policy of religious toleration, but then, between the 1760s and
the 1780s, they replaced it with "something that is usually called religious
liberty." Mark Silka, in "Defining Religious Pluralism in America: A Regional
Analysis", states that Religious pluralism "enables a country made up of people
of different faiths to exist without sectarian warfare or the persecution of
religious minorities. Understood differently in different times and places, it
is a cultural construct that embodies some shared conception of how a country's
various religious communities relate to each other and to the larger nation
whole." Religious pluralism can be defined as "respecting the otherness of
others" and accepting the given uniqueness endowed to each one of us.
Interfaith dialogue. Religious pluralism is sometimes used as a synonym for
interfaith dialogue. Interfaith dialogue refers to dialogue between members of
different religions for the goal of reducing conflicts between their religions
and to achieve agreed upon mutually desirable goals. Inter-religious dialogue
is difficult if the partners adopt a position of particularism, i.e. if they
only care about the concerns of their own group, but is favored by the opposite
attitude of universalism, where care is taken for the concerns of others.
Interfaith dialogue is easier if a religion's adherents have some form of
inclusivism, the belief that people in other religions may also have a way to
salvation, even though the fullness of salvation can be achieved only in
one‚Äôs own religion. Conversely, believers with an exclusivist mindset will
rather tend to proselytize followers of other religions, than seek an open-
ended dialogue with them. Conditions for the existence of religious pluralism.
Freedom of religion encompasses all religions acting within the law in a
particular region, whether or not an individual religion accepts that other
religions are legitimate or that freedom of religious choice and religious
plurality in general are good things. Exclusivist religions teach that theirs
is the only way to salvation and to religious truth, and some of them would
even argue that it is necessary to suppress the falsehoods taught by other
religions. Some Protestant sects argue fiercely against Roman Catholicism, and
fundamentalist Christians of all kinds teach that religious practices like
those of paganism and witchcraft are pernicious. This was a common historical
attitude prior to the Enlightenment, and has appeared as governmental policy
into the present day under systems like Afghanistan's Taliban regime, which
destroyed the ancient Buddhas of Bamyan. Many religious believers believe that
religious pluralism should entail not competition but cooperation, and argue
that societal and theological change is necessary to overcome religious
differences between different religions, and denominational conflicts within
the same religion. For most religious traditions, this attitude is essentially
based on a non-literal view of one's religious traditions, hence allowing for
respect to be engendered between different traditions on fundamental principles
rather than more marginal issues. It is perhaps summarized as an attitude which
rejects focus on immaterial differences, and instead gives respect to those
beliefs held in common. Giving one religion or denomination special rights that
are denied to others can weaken religious pluralism. This situation obtains in
certain European countries, where Roman Catholicism or regional forms of
Protestantism have special status. For example see the entries on the Lateran
Treaty and Church of England Relativism, the belief that all religions are
equal in their value and that none of the religions gives access to absolute
truth, is an extreme form of inclusivism. Likewise, syncretism, the attempt to
take over creeds of practices from other religions or even to blend practices
or creeds from different religions into one new faith is an extreme form of
inter-religious dialogue. Syncretism must not be confused with ecumenism, the
attempt to bring closer and eventually reunite different denominations of one
religion that have a common origin but were separated by a schism. Religious
freedom did not exist at all in many Communist countries such as Albania and
the Stalinist Soviet Union, where the state prevented the public expression of
religious belief and even persecuted some or all religions. This situation
persists still today in North Korea, and to some extent in China and Vietnam.
History of religious pluralism. Cultural and religious pluralism has a long
history and development that reaches from antiquity to contemporary trends in
post-modernity. Inter-religious pluralism. For purposes of exposition, views
about religious pluralism may be loosely classified into views about 1)
"inter"-religious pluralism and 2) "intra"-religious pluralism. By inter-
religious pluralism, we mean the views held within one major faith tradition
(e.g., Christianity) about the validity or truth of other major faith
traditions (e.g., Judaism, Buddhism, Islam, etc.). In contrast, intra-religious
pluralism refers to views held by specific schools or denominations "within" a
major faith tradition (e.g., by Eastern Orthodox Christians) about the validity
or truth of other schools or denominations within the same major faith
tradition (e.g., about Protestant Christianity or Roman Catholic Christianity).
The following subsections examine inter-religious pluralism within several
major faith traditions. Bah√°'√≠ views. Bah√°'u'll√°h, founder of Bah√°'√≠
Faith, urged the elimination of religious intolerance. He taught that God is
one, and has manifested himself to humanity through several historic
messengers. Bah√°'u'll√°h taught that Bah√°'√≠s must associate with peoples of
all religions, showing the love of God in relations with them, whether this is
reciprocated or not. Bah√°'√≠'s refer to the concept of Progressive revelation,
which means that God's will is revealed to mankind progressively as mankind
matures and is better able to comprehend the purpose of God in creating
humanity. In this view, God's word is revealed through a series of messengers:
Abraham, Krishna, Moses, Buddha, Jesus, Mohammed, and Bah√°'u'll√°h (the
founder of the Bah√°'√≠ Faith) among them. In the "Kit√°b-i-√çq√°n" ("Book of
Certitude"), Bah√°'u'll√°h explains that messengers of God have a twofold
station, one of divinity and one of an individual. According to Bah√°'√≠
writings, there will not be another messenger for many hundreds of years. There
is also a respect for the religious traditions of the native peoples of the
planet who may have little other than oral traditions as a record of their
religious figures. Buddhist views. Brahmajala Sutta, translated by Thich Nhat
Hanh (1991), "Old Path, White Clouds", Parralax Press. ISBN 978-0-938077-26-8
(pp. 399-400) People from different traditions should keep their own, rather
than change. However, some Tibetan may prefer Islam, so he can follow it. Some
Spanish prefer Buddhism; so follow it. But think about it carefully. Don‚Äôt do
it for fashion. Some people start Christian, follow Islam, then Buddhism, then
nothing. In the United States I have seen people who embrace Buddhism and
change their clothes! Like the New Age. They take something Hindu, something
Buddhist, something, something‚Ä¶ That is not healthy. For individual
practitioners, having one truth, one religion, is very important. Several
truths, several religions, is contradictory. I am Buddhist. Therefore, Buddhism
is the only truth for me, the only religion. To my Christian friend,
Christianity is the only truth, the only religion. To my Muslim friend, is the
only truth, the only religion. In the meantime, I respect and admire my
Christian friend and my Muslim friend. If by unifying you mean mixing, that is
impossible, useless. Classical Greek and Roman pagan views. The ancient Greeks
were polytheists; pluralism in that historical era meant accepting the
existence of and validity of other peoples religions. Ancient Greeks employed
Interpretatio Graeca whereby the gods of other religions were equated with
those of their own pantheon. The Romans easily accomplished this task by
subsuming the entire set of gods from other faiths into their own religion;
this was done on rare occasion by adding a new god to their own pantheon; on
most occasions they identified another religion's gods with their own, see
syncretism which can be a form of Inclusivism. However, because divinity was
the basis for the mandate of the state, atheism was considered a capital crime
in both ancient Greece and Rome. This was further solidified as the status quo
following the installation of the Roman imperial cult of deification of sitting
emperors, and Roman pluralism was not officially extended to Abrahamic
monotheistic religions until Christianity (which had been previously branded an
atheistic religion by the state) became the de facto official religion of the
empire. Christian views. Some Christians have argued that religious pluralism
is an invalid or self-contradictory concept. Maximal forms of religious
pluralism claim that all religions are equally true, or that one religion can
be true for some and another for others. Some Christians hold this idea to be
logically impossible from the Principle of contradiction. I do not deny for a
moment that the truth of God has reached others through other channels -
indeed, I hope and pray that it has. So while I have a special attachment to
one mediator, I have respect for them all. (p. 12) The Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter-day Saints also teaches a form of religious pluralism, that there is
at least some truth in almost all religions and philosophies. Hindu views. The
Hindu religion is naturally pluralistic. A well-known "Rig Vedic" hymn says
that "Truth is One, though the sages know it variously." ("√âkam sat vipra
bahudƒÅ vadanti"). Similarly, in the "Bhagavad Gƒ´tƒÅ" (4:11), God, manifesting
as an incarnation, states that "As people approach me, so I receive them. All
paths lead to me" ("ye yathƒÅ mƒÅ·πÉ prapadyante tƒÅ·πÉs tathƒÅiva bhajƒÅmyaham
mama vartmƒÅnuvartante manu·π£yƒÅ·∏• pƒÅrtha sarva≈õa·∏•"). The Hindu religion
has no theological difficulties in accepting degrees of truth in other
religions. Hinduism emphasizes that everyone actually worships the same God,
whether one knows it or not. Just as Hindus worshiping Ganesh is seen as valid
by those worshiping Vishnu, so someone worshiping Jesus or Allah is accepted.
Many "foreign" deities become assimilated into Hinduism, and some Hindus may
sometimes offer prayers to Jesus along with their traditional forms of God.
Islamic views. "Let there be no compulsion in religion: Truth stands outs clear
from Error" . Verse 2:256 of Surat Al-Baqarah "If they charge you with
falsehood, say: 'For me are my deeds and for you are your deeds! You are free
from responsibility for what I do, and I for what you do' " . Verse 10:41 of
Surat Yunus "Say, 'The Truth is from your Lord' Let him who will, believe, and
let him who will, reject (it)' " Verse 18:29 of Surat Al-Kahf "To you (non-
believers) be your Way (Religion), and to me mine" . Verse 109:6 of Surat Al-
Kafirun The Quran criticizes Christians and Jews who believed that their own
religions the only source of Truth. Islam's fundamental theological concept is
belief in one God. Muslims are not expected to visualize God but to worship and
adore him as a protector. Any kind of idolatry is condemned in Islam.() As a
result, Muslims hold that for someone to worship any other gods or deities
other than Allah ("Shirk" (polytheism)) is a sin that will lead to separation
from Allah. Muslims believe that Allah sent the Qur'an to bring peace and
harmony to humanity through Islam (submission to Allah). Muhammad's worldwide
mission was to establish universal peace under the "Khilafat". The "Khilafat"
ensured security of the lives and property of non-Muslims under the "dhimmi"
system. This status was originally only made available to non-Muslims who were
"People of the Book" (Christians, Jews, and Sabians), but was later extended to
include Zoroastrians, Sikhs,Hindus, Mandeans(Sabians), and Buddhists. "Dhimmi"
had more rights than other non-Muslim religious subjects, but often fewer legal
and social rights than Muslims. Some Muslims, however, disagree, and hold that
adherents of these faiths cannot be "dhimmi". Dhimmi enjoyed some freedoms
under the state founded by Muhammad and could practice their religious rituals
according to their faith and beliefs. It should be noted that non-Muslims who
were not classified as "people of the book", for example practitioners of the
pre-Muslim indigenous Arabian religions, had few or no rights in Muslim
society. Muslim rule spread through conquest and this indirectly coerced many
to convert to Islam. In other words, war was waged to put lands under Muslim
rule, but the subjects were theoretically free to continue practice whatever
religion they chose. However, the non-Muslim dhimmis were subject to taxation
jizyah at a different rate of the Muslim zakat. Dhimmis also faced economic
impediments, restrictions on political participation and/or social advancement
based on their non-Muslim status. Religious persecution is also prohibited,
although religious persecution in Muslim majority states have occurred,
especially during periods of cruel rulers and general economic hardships. Pre-
Islamic religious minorities continue to exist in some of their native
countries, although only as marginal percentages of the overall population.
Sufism views. The Sufis were practitioners of the esoteric mystic traditions
within an Islam at certain point sufism defined by the sufi master or Pir
(Sufism) or fakeer or Wali in the language of the people by dancing and singing
and incorporating various philosophies, theologies, ideologies and religions
together. E.g. Christiainity, Judaism, paganism, platonism, Zorostrainism,
Buddhism, Hinduism, Sikhism and so forth with time. The most famous of the
sufis is Rumi. Other famous sufi masters are Sheikh Farid, Bulleh Shah, Shah
Hussain, Shams Tabrizi, Waris Shah, Ghazali, Mian Mir, Attar of Nishapur, Amir
Khusrow, Salim Chishti. see many more famous sufis here List of Sufis. The
sufis were considered by many to have divine revelations with messages of
peace, tolerance, equality, pluarism, love for all and hate for no one,
humanitarians, philosophers, psychologists and much more. Many had the teaching
if you want to change the world, change yourself and you will change the whole
world. The views of the sufi poets, philosophers and theologians have inspired
multiple forms of modern day academia as well as philosophers of other
religions. See also Blind men and an elephant. Persian poet Rumi says, Rumi
also says "A true Lover doesn't follow any one religion, be sure of that. Since
in the religion of Love, there is no irreverence or faith. When in Love, body,
mind, heart and soul don't even exist. Become this, fall in Love, and you will
not be separated again." The sufi platform was considered by exoteric dogmatic
Muslims as a trojan horse ideology executing doctrine of deception (see
Taqiyya) to convert others while others considered it outright heresy,
blasphemy, innovation(biddah), kuffar, apostasy, haram and as such many sufis
have gone under persuctions and executions for apostasy and trison charges at
which point many tend to have supernatural events take place alike to Jesus
crucification. Many sufis throughout their life display religious healing,
miracles and supernatural events which seems like God has connected with the
sufi alike to vedic and buddhist enlightenment. For more see Fana (Sufism),
Baqaa, Yaqeen, Kashf, Manzil, Haqiqa, Sufi metaphysics, Sufi philosophy.
Ahmadiyya views. Ahmadis recognize many founders of world religions to be from
God, who all brought teaching and guidance from God to all peoples. According
to the Ahmadiyya understanding of the Quran, every nation in the history of
mankind has been sent a prophet, as the Quran states: "And there is a guide for
every people". Though the Quran mentions only 24 prophets, the founder of
Islam, Muhammad states that the world has seen 124,000 prophets. Thus other
than the prophets mentioned in the Quran, Ahmadis, with support from
theological study also recognize Buddha, Krishna, founders of Chinese religions
to be divinely appointed individuals. ‚ÄúAccording to this teaching there has
not been a single people at any time in history or anywhere in the world who
have not had a warner from God, a teacher, a prophet. According to the Holy
Quran there have been prophets at all times and in all countries. India, China,
Russia, Afghanistan, parts of Africa, Europe, America - all had prophets
according to the theory of divine guidance taught by the Holy Quran. When,
therefore, Muslims hear about prophets of other peoples or other countries,
they do not deny them. They do not brand them as liars. Muslims believe that
other peoples have had their teachers. If other peoples have had prophets,
books, and laws, these constitute no difficulty for Islam.‚Äù ‚ÄúOur God has
never discriminated between one people and another. This is illustrated by the
fact that all the potentials and capabilities (Prophets) which have been
granted to the Aryans (Hindus) have also been granted to the races inhabiting
Arabia, Persia, Syria, China, Japan, Europe and America.‚Äù Jain views.
"AnekƒÅntavƒÅda", the principle of relative pluralism, is one of the basic
principles of Jainism. In this view, the truth or the reality is perceived
differently from different points of view, and no single point of view is the
complete truth. Jain doctrine states that an object has infinite modes of
existence and qualities and they cannot be completely perceived in all its
aspects and manifestations, due to inherent limitations of the humans. Only the
Kevalins - the omniscient beings - can comprehend the object in all its aspects
and manifestations, and all others are capable of knowing only a part of it.
Consequently, no one view can claim to represent the absolute truth. Jains
compare all attempts to proclaim absolute truth with " andhgajnyaya " or the
"maxim of the blind men and elephant", wherein all the blind men claimed to
explain the true appearance of the elephant, but could only partly succeed due
to their narrow perspective. Sikh views. The Sikh Gurus (religious leaders)
have propagated the message of "many paths" leading to the one God and ultimate
salvation for all souls who treading on the path of righteousness. They have
supported the view that proponents of all faiths can, by doing good and
virtuous deeds and by remembering the Lord can certainly achieve salvation.
Students of the Sikh faith are told to accept all leading faiths as possible
vehicles for attaining spiritual enlightenment, provided the faithful study,
ponder and practice the teachings of their prophets and leaders. Sikhism had
many interactions and of influences on and from Sufism as well as Hinduism see
Islam and Sikhism and Hinduism and Sikhism. The holy book of the Sikhs (the Sri
Guru Granth Sahib) says, Sriganth.org Guru Granth Sahib page 1350 As well as;
"The seconds, minutes, and hours, days, weeks and months and various seasons
originate from One Sun; O nanak, in just the same way, the many forms originate
from the Creator." Guru Granth Sahib page 12,13 The Guru Granth Sahib also says
that Bhagat Namdev and Bhagat Kabir, who were both believed to be Hindus, both
attained salvation though they were born before Sikhism took root and were
clearly not Sikhs.This highlights and reinforces the Guru's saying that
"peoples of other faiths" can join with God as true and also at the same time
signify that Sikhism is not the exclusive path for liberation. Additionally the
Guru Granth Sahib says;  Again, the Guru Granth Sahib provides this verse:
Srigranth.org Guru Granth Sahib page 67 Most of the 15 Sikh Bhagats who are
mentioned in their holy book were non-Sikhs and belonged to Hindu and Muslim
faiths, which were the most prevalent religions of this region. The pluaristic
dialogue of Sikhism began with the founder of Sikhism Guru Nanak after becoming
enlightened saying the words "Na koi hindu na koi musalman" - There is no
Hindu, there is no Muslim. He recognised that religious labels held no value
and it is the deeds of human that will be judged in the hereafter what we call
ourselves religiously holds no value. Sikhs have always being eager exponents
of interfaith dialogue and will not only accept the right of other to practise
their faith but have in the past fought and laid down their lives to protect
this right for others. See the sacrifice of the ninth Sikh Guru, Guru Tegh
Bahadar who on the final desperate and heart-rending pleas of the Kashmiri
Pandit, agreed to put up a fight for their right to practise their religion in
which he was executed so another religion besides his own could have the
freedom to practice their religion against the tyrant moghul empire who were
forcing people to accept Islam. Intra-religious pluralism. As noted earlier,
intra-religious pluralism refers to views held by specific schools or
denominations "within" a major faith tradition (e.g., by Eastern Orthodox
Christians) about the validity or truth of other schools or denominations
within the same major faith tradition (e.g., about Protestant Christianity or
Roman Catholic Christianity). The following subsections describe views about
intra-religious pluralism by various denominations and religious thinkers
within several major faith traditions. Christian views. Classical Christian
views. Before the Great Schism, mainstream Christianity confessed "one holy
catholic and apostolic church", in the words of the Nicene Creed. Roman
Catholics, Orthodox Christians, Episcopalians and most Protestant Christian
denominations still maintain this belief. Church unity was something very
visible and tangible, and schism was just as serious an offense as heresy.
Following the Great Schism, Roman Catholicism sees and recognizes the Orthodox
Sacraments as valid. Eastern Orthodoxy does not have the concept of "validity"
when applied to Sacraments, but it considers the "form" of Roman Catholic
Sacraments to be acceptable, if still devoid of actual spiritual content. Both
generally regard each other as "heterodox" and "schismatic", while continuing
to recognize each other as Christian. Attitudes of both towards different
Protestant groups vary, primarily based upon how strongly Trinitarian the
Protestant group in question might be. Many Christians hold that the Christian
church is not just an institution, which can be broken into many denominations.
They hold that each instituted church is able to worship God in a way that
conforms to Scripture, which allows for many different styles and customs. They
hold that all true Christians are united in belief in Jesus Christ, which can
be judged against such documents as the Apostles' Creed. Modern Christian
views. Many Protestant Christian groups hold that only believers which believe
in certain fundamental doctrines know the true pathway to salvation. The core
of this doctrine is that Jesus Christ was a perfect man, is the Son of God and
that he died and rose again for the wrongdoing of those who will accept the
gift of salvation. They continue to believe in "one" church, believing in
fundamental issues there is unity and non-fundamental issues there is liberty.
Some evangelicals are doubtful if the Roman Catholicism or Eastern Orthodoxy
are still valid manifestations of the Church and usually reject religious
(typically restorationist) movements rooted in 19th century American
Christianity, such as Mormonism; also Christian Science, or Jehovah's Witnesses
as not distinctly Christian. Modern Christian ideas on intra-religious
pluralism (between different denominations of Christianity) are discussed in
the article on Ecumenism. Religious pluralism and human service professions.
"...recognizes the existence of a religious or spiritual absolute reality but
allows for multiple interpretations and paths toward it. In contrast to the
exclusivist who maintains that there is a single path "up the mountain of God,"
the pluralist recognizes many paths as valid. Although both the exclusivist and
the pluralist may agree on the existence of religious or spiritual reality, the
pluralist recognizes that this reality is expressed in different cultures and
by different people in different ways. Because humans are mortal and limited, a
single human religious system cannot encompass all of the religious or
spiritual absolute reality..." (p. 167) Importantly, "the pluralistic therapist
can hold personal religious beliefs while appreciating those of a client with
different religious beliefs. The pluralist recognizes that religious value
differences can and will exist between counselors and clients without adversely
affecting therapy" (p.¬ 168). The stances implied by these four helping
orientations on several key issues, such as "should religious issues be
discussed in counseling?", have also been presented in tabular form (p.¬ 362,
Table 12.1). The profession of chaplaincy, a religious profession, must also
deal with issues of pluralism and the relevance of a pluralistic stance. For
example, Friberg (2001) argues that "With growing populations of immigrants and
adherents of religions not previously seen in significant numbers in North
America, spiritual care must take religion and diversity seriously. Utmost
respect for the residents' spiritual and religious histories and orientations
is imperative" (p.¬ 182).
