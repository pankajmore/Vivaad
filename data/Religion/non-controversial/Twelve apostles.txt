Apostle (Christian) Jesus is stated in the New Testament to have had twelve
apostles who, with the Great Commission, he sent to spread the message of the
Gospel to all nations after his resurrection. There is also an orthodox
tradition derived from the Gospel of Luke of Seventy Apostles. Paul the Apostle
(Saul of Tarsus), not one of the twelve or the seventy but a later convert,
"the apostle of the Gentiles", claimed a special commission from the
resurrected Jesus, separate from the Great Commission given to the twelve. Paul
did not restrict the term apostle to the twelve, referring to his mentor
Barnabas and others as apostles, either because he didn't know it or resisted
it. This restricted usage appears in Revelation. In modern usage, major
missionaries are sometimes termed apostles, as in Saint Patrick, "Apostle of
Ireland". The sub-period of Early Christianity during the lifetimes of the
apostles is called the Apostolic Age. In the 2nd century, association with the
apostles was esteemed as evidence of authority and such churches are known as
Apostolic Sees. Paul's epistles were accepted as scripture (see Development of
the New Testament canon), and two of the four gospels were associated with
apostles, as were other New Testament works. Various Christian texts, such as
the Didache and the Apostolic Constitutions, were attributed to the twelve
apostles. Bishops traced their lines of succession back to individual apostles,
who were said to have established churches across great territories. Christian
bishops have traditionally claimed authority deriving, by apostolic succession,
from the twelve. Early Church Fathers came to be associated with "apostles",
such as Pope Clement I with Peter the apostle (see Apostolic Fathers). The
Apostles' Creed, popular in the West, was said to have been composed by the
apostles themselves. Terminology. The word "apostle" has two meanings, the
broader meaning of a messenger and the narrow meaning of an early apostle
directly linked to Jesus. The more general meaning of the word is translated
into Latin as "missio", and from this word we get missionary. The word
"apostle" comes from the Greek word ("apostolos"). According to the Greek-
English Lexicon of the New Testament, "...Judaism had an office known as
apostle (×©×œ×™×—)". The "Friberg Greek Lexicon" gives a broad definition as
one who is sent on a mission, a commissioned representative of a congregation,
a messenger for God, a person who has the special task of founding and
establishing churches. The "UBS Greek Dictionary" also describes an apostle
broadly as a messenger. The "Louw-Nida Lexicon" gives a very narrow definition
of a special messenger, generally restricted to the immediate followers of
Jesus, or extended to some others like Paul or other early Christians active in
proclaiming the gospel. Portrayal. The apostles are portrayed in the New
Testament as having been Galilean Jews. The names of the majority of them are
Hebrew names, although some had Greek names. Even Paul, the "apostle of the
Gentiles", who said that Jesus revealed himself to him only after his ascension
and appointed him to his mission, was a Jew by birth and always proud of it,
although after his conversion he adopted the Roman surname "Paulus" as his
name, rendered in English as Paul. Paul made his case to the Corinthian Church
that he was an apostle by the evidence of God's power working through him, "The
things that mark an apostleâ€”signs, wonders and miraclesâ€”were done among you
with great perseverance." Later in the Gospel narratives the twelve apostles
are described as having been commissioned to preach the Gospel to "all the
nations," regardless of whether Jew or Gentile. Paul emphasized the important
role of the apostles in the church of God when he said that the household of
God is "built upon the foundation of apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus
himself being the cornerstone". The Twelve Apostles. Synoptic Gospels. The list
in the Gospel of Luke differs from Matthew and Mark at two points. It lists
"Judas the son of James" instead of "Thaddeus." (For more information see Jude
the Apostle). The wording in Luke may be translated "Simon the Cananean"
instead of "Simon the Zealot". These are generally thought to be the same
person. In the Synoptic Gospels, Jesus selected Peter, James, and John to
witness his transfiguration and to be near him when he prayed at Gethsemane. In
Mark, the twelve are obtuse, failing to understand the importance of Jesus'
miracles and parables. Gospel of John. Of these, only Nathanael is not in the
lists in the other gospels. He has traditionally been identified with
Bartholomew, although this identification is disputed by some. The three not
mentioned at all in John are James son of Alphaeus, Matthew and Simon the
Canaanite/Zealot. Calling by Jesus. The three Synoptic Gospels record the
circumstances in which some of the disciples were recruited, Matthew only
describing the recruitment of Simon, Andrew, James, and John. All three
Synoptic Gospels state that these four were recruited fairly soon after Jesus
returned from being tempted by the devil. Despite Jesus only briefly requesting
that they join him, they are all described as immediately consenting, and
abandoning their nets to do so. Traditionally the immediacy of their consent
was viewed as an example of divine power, although this statement isn't made in
the text itself. The alternative and much more ordinary solution is that Jesus
was simply friends with the individuals beforehand, as implied by the Gospel of
John, which states that Andrew and an unnamed other had been a disciple of John
the Baptist, and started following Jesus as soon as Jesus had been baptized.
The Bible identifies Jesus as a "tekton", a Greek word meaning "builder" or
"artisan", traditionally translated as carpenter. Considering this profession,
it is plausible that Jesus had been employed to build and repair fishing
vessels, thus having many opportunities to interact with and befriend such
fishermen. Albright and Mann extrapolate from Simon's and Andrew's abandonment
of their nets, that Matthew is emphasizing the importance of renunciation by
converting to Christianity, since fishing was profitable, though required large
start-up costs, and abandoning everything would have been an important
sacrifice. Regardless, Simon and Andrew's abandonment of what were effectively
their most important worldly possessions was taken as a model by later
Christian ascetics. Matthew describes Jesus meeting James and John, also
fishermen and brothers, very shortly after recruiting Simon and Andrew. Matthew
and Mark identify James and John as sons of Zebedee. Luke adds to Matthew and
Mark that James and John worked as a team with Simon and Andrew. Matthew states
that at the time of the encounter, James and John were repairing their nets,
but readily joined Jesus without hesitation. This parallels the accounts of
Mark and Luke, but Matthew implies that the men have also abandoned their
father (since he is present in the ship they abandon behind them), and Carter
feels this should be interpreted to mean that Matthew's view of Jesus is one of
a figure rejecting the traditional patriarchal structure of society, where the
father had command over his children; most scholars, however, just interpret it
to mean that Matthew intended these two to be seen as even more devoted than
the other pair. The synoptics go on to describe that much later, after Jesus
had later begun his ministry, Jesus noticed, while teaching, a tax collector in
his booth. The tax collector, "Levi" according to some Gospels, "Matthew"
according to others, is asked by Jesus to become one of his disciples. Matthew/
Levi is stated to have accepted and then invited Jesus for a meal with his
friends. Tax collectors were seen as villains in Jewish society, and the
Pharisees are described by the synoptics as asking Jesus why he is having a
meal with such disreputable people. The reply Jesus gives to this is now well
known: "it is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come
to call the righteous, but sinners." Election of Matthias to Judas's share in
their ministry. So, between the ascension of Christ and the day of Pentecost,
the remaining apostles elected a twelfth apostle by casting lots, a traditional
Israelite way to determine the Will of God. (see ) The lot fell upon Matthias.
This is one of several verses used by the Orthodox Churches (including
Catholic, Anglican, and Eastern Orthodox Churches) in support of their teaching
of Apostolic Succession, and by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
in support of the Great Apostasy. First Epistle to the Corinthians. The text
has some unresolved issues. Paul does not refer to "the twelve" anywhere else
in his writings, nor did he ever limit the usage of the word "apostle" to the
twelve disciples who by definition were the ones appointed as apostles. Deaths
of the twelve apostles. Christian tradition has generally passed down that all
but one were martyred, with John surviving into old age. Only the death of
James, son of Zebedee is described in the New Testament, and the details of the
other deaths are the subject of pious legends of varying authenticity. In some
cases there is near unanimity in the tradition, and in other cases, there are
widely varying and inconsistent accounts. Judas Iscariot, originally one of the
twelve, died after Jesus' trial. Matthew 27:5 says that he hanged himself, and
Acts 1:18 says that he fell, burst open, and his "bowels gushed out." Matthias
was elected to take his place as one of the twelve. Tombs of the apostles. Out
of the eleven apostles excluding Judas Iscariot, the burial sites of only seven
have been identified by Christian tradition. The Apostle to the Gentiles: Paul
of Tarsus. In his writings, Paul, though not one of the original twelve,
described himself as an "apostle", one "born out of due time" (e.g., , 1
Corinthians 15:8 and other letters). He was called by the resurrected Jesus
himself during his Road to Damascus vision. With Barnabas, he was allotted the
role of apostle in the church. He referred to himself as the "apostle of the
Gentiles." He also described some of his companions as being called of the Lord
as "apostles" (Barnabas, Silas, Apollos, Andronicus and Junia). As the Catholic
Encyclopedia states, "It is at once evident that in a Christian sense, everyone
who had received a mission from God, or Christ, to man could be called
'Apostle'"; thus extending the original sense beyond the twelve. Since Paul
claimed to have received the gospel through a revelation of Jesus Christ after
the latter's death and resurrection (rather than before like the twelve), he
was often obliged to defend his apostolic authority () and proclaim that he had
seen and was anointed by Jesus while on the road to Damascus; but James, Peter
and John in Jerusalem accepted his calling to the apostleship from the Lord to
the Gentiles (specifically those not circumcised) as of equal authority as
Peter's to the Jews (specifically those circumcised) according to Paul. "James,
Peter and John, those reputed to be pillars â€¦ agreed that we and Barnabas
should go to the Gentiles, and they to the Jews." Paul, despite his divine
calling as an apostle, considered himself perhaps inferior to the other
apostles because he had originally persecuted Christ's followers. In addition,
despite the Little Commission of Matthew 10, the Twelve did not limit their
mission to solely Jews as Cornelius the Centurion is widely considered the
first Gentile convert and he was converted by Peter, and the Great Commission
of the Resurrected Jesus is specifically to "all nations". Other apostles in
the New Testament. Barnabas. In , Barnabas is referred to as an apostle.
Andronicus and Junia. 1) That Andronicus and Junia were "of note among the
apostles," that is, distinguished apostles. 2) That Andronicus and Junia were
"well known "among" the apostles" meaning "well known "to" the apostles". In
the first view it is believed that, Paul is referring to a female apostle.
Unhappy with reference to a female apostle, editors and translators have often
changed the name to "Junias," the masculine version of Junia, as in the Revised
Standard Version. While "Junia" was a common name, "Junias" was not. This
alteration is part of a pattern by which later editors changed Paul's epistles
to make them less favorable toward women in positions of authority. In the
second view, it is believed that Paul is simply making mention of the
outstanding character of these two people which was acknowledged by the
apostles. Historically it has been virtually impossible to tell which of the
two views were correct. The second view has however, in recent years, been
defended from a scholarly perspective by Daniel Wallace and Michael Burer.
Following an examination of this Greek phrase ("episÄ“moi" + the preposition
"en") in biblical Greek, patristic Greek, papyri, inscriptions as well as
Hellenistic and classical Greek texts, they conclude that the normal way one
would attempt to convey the meaning "to the apostles" rather than "among the
apostles" was employed by Paul. Silas. Silas is referred to as an apostle in
and along with Timothy and Paul. He also performs the functioning of an apostle
as Paul's companion in Paul's second missionary journey in Timothy. Timothy is
referred to as an apostle in and along with Silas and Paul. However, in he is
only called a "brother" when Paul refers to himself as "an apostle of Christ".
Timothy performs many of the functions of an apostle in the commissioning of
Paul in 1st and 2nd Timothy, though in those epistles Paul refers to him as his
"son" in the faith. Apollos. Apollos is included as "us apostles" in (see , ,
and ) along with Paul and Cephas (Peter). Later Christianizing apostles. Roman
Catholic tradition. A number of successful pioneering missionaries are known as
"apostles". In this sense, in the traditional list below, the "apostle" either
first brought Christianity to a land or a people, or spread the faith in places
where a few struggling Christian communities did already exist. "Apostle to the
apostles". Mary Magdalene Harvard theologian Karen King cites references in the
Gospel of John that the risen Jesus gives Mary Magdalene special teaching and
commissions her as an "Apostle to the Apostles." Mary is the first to announce
the resurrection and to fulfill the role of an apostleâ”€someone sent by Jesus
with a special message or commission, to spread the gospel ("good news") and to
lead the early church. The first message she was given was to announce to Peter
and the others that "He is risen!"(Mt. 28:7 Mk. 16:9-11 Lk. 24:10 Jn. 20:2)
Although the term is not specifically used of her in the New Testament, Eastern
Christianity refers to her as "equal to the apostles"), and later traditions
name her as "the apostle to the apostles." King writes that the strength of
this literary tradition makes it possible to suggest that historically Mary was
a prophetic visionary and leader within one sector of the early Christian
movement after the death of Jesus. "Equal to the apostles". Some Eastern
Orthodox saints are given the title "isapostolos" ("equal-to-the-apostles"; ),
e.g., Saint Cosmas. Beginning with Saint Constantine, this was also a frequent
title of Byzantine Emperors. The Emperor Constantine the Great, sometimes
considered founder of the Byzantine Empire, formally recognized Christianity in
the Roman Empire in the Edict of Milan in 313 (see also Constantine I and
Christianity). According to Philip Schaff's History of the Christian Church:
"Soon after his death, Eusebius set him above the greatest princes of all
times; from the fifth century he began to be recognized in the East as a saint;
and the Greek and Russian church to this day celebrates his memory under the
extravagant title of "Isapostolos", the "Equal of the apostles". The Latin
church, on the contrary, has never placed him among the saints, but has been
content with naming him "the Great," in remembrance of his services to the
cause of Christianity and civilization. Comp the Acta Sact. ad 21 Maii, p.Â 13
sq. Niebuhr remarks: "When certain oriental writers call Constantine 'equal to
the apostles', they do not know what they are saying; and to speak of him as a
'saint' is a profanation of the word". In the Russian Orthodox Church also
Prince Vladimir I of Kiev and Princess Olga of Kiev are revered as equal-to-
apostles. Fivefold ministry. The fivefold ministry states that the apostle
continues to be a valid and active office in the contemporary church. C. Peter
Wagner has been especially prominent in the New Apostolic Reformation, which
argues that God is restoring the lost offices of prophet and apostle.
