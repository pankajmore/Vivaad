Vespers Vespers is the sunset evening prayer service in the Western Catholic,
Eastern (Byzantine) Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Anglican, and Lutheran
liturgies of the canonical hours. The word comes from the Greek ·ºëœÉœÄŒ≠œÅŒ±
and the Latin "vesper", meaning "evening." It is also referred to in the
Anglican tradition as Evening Prayer or Evensong. The term is also used in some
Protestant denominations (such as the Presbyterian Church or Seventh-day
Adventist Church) to describe evening services. Current use. Eastern Orthodox.
In the Orthodox Church and those Eastern Catholic Churches which follow the
Byzantine Rite, there are three forms of Vespers: Great Vespers, Daily Vespers
and Small Vespers. Great Vespers is the form served on Sundays and major feast
days (those of Polyeleos rank or above) when it may be celebrated alone or as
part of an All-Night Vigil, or as the commencement of the Divine Liturgy, or on
a few special occasions, "e.g.", Good Friday or Pascha afternoon. Daily Vespers
is the form served on other days when Great Vespers is not served. Small
Vespers is a very abbreviated form of the service which is celebrated only on
the afternoon before an All-Night Vigil. Since the liturgical day begins at
sunset, Vespers is the first service of the day, and the hymns of Vespers
introduce the themes of the upcoming day. Great Vespers. On strict fast days
when food and drink are prohibited before vespers, "e.g.", Christmas Eve, the
Annunciation when it falls on a weekday of great lent, or Holy Saturday,
Vespers is joined to the Divine Liturgy, functioning in place of the typica as
the framework of the hymns of the Liturgy of the Catechumens. After the
readings from the Old Testament, the Trisagion is chanted, followed by the
Epistle and Gospel, and the Divine Liturgy proceeds normally from that point.
On these occasions, as at other times the Gospel is read at vespers, the Little
Entrance is made with the Gospel Book instead of the censer. The Liturgy of the
Presanctified Gifts always is similarly combined with vespers, with the first
half of Vespers (up to and including the Old Testament readings) making up a
significant portion of the service. Oriental Orthodox. Also called the Raising
of Incense, Vespers is an introduction and preparation for the Liturgy,
consisting of a collection of prayers, praises and Thanksgiving prayers which
request the Lord's blessings upon the sacramental service. This is true for the
Coptic Orthodox Church; use of the term and order of services are somewhat
different in the Ethiopian, Syrian, and the other Oriental Orthodox Churches.
Vespers in other Christian churches and religious bodies. Since its inception,
the Anglican Communion has maintained an evening office, which is called
Evening Prayer (or "Evensong"). There are prescribed forms of the service in
Anglican prayer book. A similar form of the service is found in the Vespers
section of The Lutheran Hymnal. The Anglican Breviary contains Vespers in
English according to the pre-1970 Roman Rite. For information on that service,
see above, as in the Roman Breviary. Daily office books that conform to the
historic structure of Vespers have also been published by the Pilgrim Press
(The New Century Psalter) and Westminster John Knox Press (Book of Common
Worship Daily Prayer). Both publishing houses are affiliated with churches in
the Reformed tradition. From its traditional usage, the term Vespers has come
to be used more broadly for various evening services of other churches, some of
which model their evening services on the traditional Roman Catholic form.
Presbyterians and Methodists, as well as congregationalist religious bodies
such as Unitarian Universalism, often include congregational singing, readings,
and a period of silent meditation, contemplation, or prayer. Some regular
community vespers services are completely areligious (or at least are not
sponsored by any church) and serve simply as a time for quiet contemplation in
the evening hours. In addition, during the 19th and early 20th centuries,
synagogues in the Classical Reform Tradition sometimes referred to their Friday
evening worship services as "vespers". Nowadays, such services are instead
called "kabbalat shabbat", which means "welcoming the Sabbath". Historical
development of Vespers in the Latin Church before the Second Vatican Council.

References to psalms follow the numbering system of the Septuagint, and said in
the Latin of the Vulgate." Vespers in the 6th century. In the sixth century the
Office of Vespers in the Latin Church was almost the same as it has been
throughout the Middle Ages and up to the present day. In a document of
unquestionable authority of that period the Office is described as follows: The
evening hour, or "vespertina synaxis", is composed of four psalms, a
"capitulum", a response, a hymn, a versicle, a canticle from the Gospel, litany
("Kyrie eleison, Christe eleison"), "Pater" with the ordinary finale, "oratio",
or prayer, and dismissal ("Regula Sancti Benedicti", xvii). The psalms recited
are taken from the series of psalms from Pss. 109 to 147 (with the exception of
the groups 117 to 127 and 133 to 142); Pss. 138, 143, 144 are each divided into
two portions, whilst the Pss. 115 and 116 are united to form one. This
disposition is almost the same as that of the ""Ordo Romanus"", except that the
number of psalms recited is five instead of four. They are taken, however, from
the series 109 to 147. Here, too, we find the "capitulum", versicle, and
canticle of the ""Magnificat"". The hymn is a more recent introduction in the
Roman Vespers; the finale (litanies, "Pater", versicles, prayers) seems all to
have existed from this epoch as in the Benedictine "cursus". Like the other
hours, therefore, Vespers is divided into two parts; the psalmody, or singing
of the psalms, forming the first part, and the "capitulum" and "formul√¶" the
second. Vesper time varied according to the season between the tenth hour (4
p.m.) and the twelfth (6 p.m.). As a matter of fact it was no longer the
evening hour, but the sunset hour, so that it was celebrated before the day had
departed and consequently before there was any necessity for artificial light
("Regula S. Benedicti", xli). This is a point to be noted, as it was an
innovation. Before this epoch this evening "synaxis" was celebrated with all
the torches alight. The reason of this is that St Benedict introduced in the
cursus, another hour‚Äîthat of Compline‚Äîwhich was prescribed to be celebrated
in the evening, and which might be considered as a kind of doubling of the
Office of Lucernarium. Origins. The Rule of St. Benedict was written about 530-
43 and represents the Office of Vespers drawn up in the manner shown above.
Much earlier than this we find an evening Office corresponding to both that of
Vespers and that of Compline. Its name varies. In St. Benedict we find the name
"vespera" which has prevailed, whence the French word "v√™pres" and the English
vespers. John Cassian calls it "Vespertina synaxis", or "Vespertina solemnitas"
(P. L., XLIX, 88-9). The name, however, by which it was most widely known
during that period was "Lucernalis" or "Lucernaria hora" (l. c., 126). This
name is characteristic. It was so called because at this hour a number of
candles were lighted, not only to give light, but also for symbolical purposes.
The ""Peregrinatio"", which gives the liturgical order as practised at
Jerusalem and the date of which is probably the 4th century, calls it
"Lichnicon". This is the Latin transcription of the Greek word "lychnikon",
which corresponds to the word "Lucernarium" ("cf." AMBROSIAN LITURGY AND RITE).
The author tells us that this Office took place at the tenth hour (four o'clock
in the evening); it is really the "Office des lumi√®res", i.e. of the lights;
it was celebrated in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre; all the lamps and
torches of the church were lighted, making, as the author says, "an infinite
light". The Lucernal psalms were sung, after which followed the recitation of
the supplication and commemorations or litanies, then the prayers, and finally
the blessing and dismissal. In the "Antiphonary of Bangor", an Irish document
of the 6th century, Vespers are called "hora duodecima", which corresponds to
six o'clock in the evening, or "hora incensi", or again "ad cereum
benedicendum". All these names are interesting to note. The "hora incensi"
recalls the custom of burning incense at this hour, while at the same time the
candles were lighted. The term "ad cereum benedicendum" presents a still
greater interest because it reminds us that the ceremony of the lights at
Vespers was symbolic and very solemn. In Prudentius (4th century) we find a
hymn entitled ""Ad incensum lucern√¶"" which, according to some critics, would
appear to have been composed for the hour of the "Lucernarium" (Arevalo,
""Prudenti carmina"", I, 124, ed. 1788; "cf." also Cabrol, ""Les √©glises de
J√©rusalem, la discipline et la liturgie au IVe si√®cle"", 47). Others see in
this an allusion to the ceremony of the paschal candle. However, the
"Lucernarium" may have had, at that time, some analogy with the ceremony of
Holy Saturday, and the hymn could thus be adapted to one or the other. In the
"Old Gallican Sacramentary" (Thomasi, ""Opera"", VI, 395) we find for Holy
Saturday an "oratio ad duodecima", designed to celebrate the light as well as
the Resurrection, which would seem thus to favour our hypothesis. St. Basil
also speaks of a hymn being sung at the moment when the torches were lighted,
doubtless the famous hymn--""Lumen Hilare Sanctae Gloriae"" ("cf." Cabrol, l.
c., 47-8). Vespers, then, was the most solemn Office of the day and was
composed of the psalms called "Lucernales" (Psalm 140 is called "psalmus
lucernalis" by the Apostolic Constitutions, VIII, xxxv; "cf." II, lix; also
Cabrol, l. c.). The ""Peregrinatio"" does not mention the number of psalms sung
at this hour, but Cassian, who, a short time after the ""Peregrinatio"",
describes this Office as it was celebrated by the monks of Egypt, says they
recited twelve psalms as at Vigils (Matins). Then two lessons were read as at
Vigils, one from the Old, and the other from the New Testament. Each psalm was
followed by a short prayer (P. L., XLIX, 83-4, 88-9). For the rest Cassian
agrees with the ""Peregrinatio"". He says the Office was recited towards five
or six o'clock and that all the lights were lighted. This evening "synaxis" is
looked upon as a souvenir of the evening sacrifice of the Old Law. The use of
incense, candles, and other lights would seem to suggest the Jewish rites which
accompanied the evening sacrifice (Exodus 29:39; Numbers 28:4; Psalm 140:2;
Daniel 9:21; 1 Chronicles 23:30; "cf." Haneberg, ""Die relig. Alterth. der
Bibel"", Munich, 1869, p.¬ 362). It may thus be seen that the "Lucernarium"
was, together with Vigils, the most important part of the Offices of the day,
being composed of almost the same elements as the latter, at least in certain
regions. Its existence in the fourth century is also confirmed by St.
Augustine, St. Ambrose, St. Basil, St. Ephraem, and, a little later, by several
councils in Gaul and Spain, and by the various monastic rules (see texts in
B√§umer-Biron, l. c., 78, 80, 118-27, 188-98, 208, "etc."). The "Apostolic
Constitutions" (VIII, xxi, 34, 35) describe it in almost the same terms as the
""Peregrinatio"". Before the fourth century we find allusions to the evening
prayer in the earlier Fathers, Clement I of Rome ("Clemens Romanus"), St.
Ignatius, Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian, Origen, the Canons of St.
Hippolytus, St. Cyprian (for texts see B√§umer-Biron, l. c., I, 20 sqq., 73-4,
76, 78). Pliny the Younger, in his famous letter at the beginning of the 2nd
century, speaks of liturgical reunions of the Christians in the morning and in
the evening: ""coetus antelucani et vespertini"" (Ep., x, 97). Vespers is,
therefore, together with Vigils, the most ancient Office known in the Church.
Office of Vespers in the Middle Ages: Variations. We have already remarked that
the institution of the Office of Compline transformed the "Lucernarium" by
taking from it something of its importance and symbolism, the latter at the
same time losing its original sense. We have seen that St. Benedict calls it
only "Vespera", the name which has prevailed over that of "Lucernarium" ("cf."
Ducange, ""Glossarium med. et inf. lat."", "s.v. Vesperae"). The Gallican
Liturgy, the Mozarabic Liturgy, and, to a certain extent, the Milanese, have
preserved the "Lucernarium" ("cf." B√§umer-Biron, l. c., 358). The Eastern
Orthodox Church retains the ""Lumen hilare"" and some other traces of the
ancient "Lucernarium" in the Offices of Vespers and Compline ("cf." Smith,
"Dict. Christ. Antiq.", "s.v." Office, Divine). In the Rule of St. Columbanus,
dated about 590, Vespers still has twelve psalms, amongst which are Pss. cxii
and cxiii, the Gradual psalms, Pss. cxix "sqq." ("cf." Gougaud, ""Les
chr√©tient√©s celtiques"", 309; ""Dict. d'arch. chr√©t. et de liturgie"", "s.v.
Celtique", 3015). The "Antiphonary of Bangor", a document of Irish origin,
gives for Vespers Ps. cxii and also the ""Gloria in Excelsis"". For
modifications since the 12th century, "cf." B√§umer-Biron, l. c., II, 54 "sqq."
Changes as of 1917. The Decree ""Divino afflatu"" (November 1, 1911) involves
important changes in the old Roman Rite Office. There is an entire
rearrangement of the psalms (see Reform of the Roman Breviary by Pope Pius X)
with new ones appointed for each day of the week. These psalms are to be
recited with their antiphons, not only at the "Office de tempore" (Sundays and
"feri√¶") but also on feasts of a lesser rite than doubles of the second class,
that is to say, on simples, semidoubles (double minors), and double majors. On
feasts which are doubles of the second class and a fortiori of the first class,
as well as on feasts of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the Holy Angels, and Apostles,
the psalms are proper to the feast as heretofore. On all feasts, of whatever
rite, the second part of Vespers, that is, the "capitulum", hymn, antiphon of
the ""Magnificat"", is taken from the Sanctorale. On semi-doubles and those of
a lesser rite the suffrages are now reduced to a single antiphon and orison
which is common to all the saints heretofore commemorated, whilst the preces
(""Miserere"" and versicles) formerly imposed on the greater feri√¶ are now
suppressed. Structure of Vespers: 1917-1969. The office of Vespers in general
use before 1970 continues to be used today by those adhering to the Roman Rite
as in 1962 or to earlier versions. The structure of Vespers prior to 1970 is as
follows: Symbolism: the Hymns. Notwithstanding the changes brought about in the
course of time, Vespers still remains the great and important Office of the
evening. As already pointed out, it recalls the "sacrificium vespertinum" of
the Old Law. In the same manner as the night is consecrated to God by the
Office of the Vigil, so also is the end of the day by Vespers. It terminates,
as Matins formerly terminated, and Lauds at present terminates, by a lection,
or reading, from the Gospel, or "canticum evangelii", which, for Vespers, is
always the ""Magnificat"". This is one of the characteristic traits of Vespers,
one of the liturgical elements which this particular Office has retained in
almost all regions and at all times. There are, however, a few exceptions, as
in some liturgies the ""Magnificat"" is sung at Lauds ("cf." Cabrol in ""Dict.
d'arch. et de liturgie"", "s.v. Cantiques √©vang√©liques"). This place of
honour accorded so persistently to the canticle of Mary from such remote
antiquity is but one of the many, and of the least striking, proofs of the
devotion which has always been paid to the Blessed Virgin Mary in the Church.
The psalms used at Vespers have been selected, from time immemorial, from Pss.
cix to cxlvii, with the exception of Ps. cxviii, which on account of its
unusual length does not square with the others, and is consequently ordinarily
divided up into parts and recited at the little hours. Pss. i to cviii are
consecrated to Matins and Lauds, whilst the three last psalms, cxlviii to cl,
belong invariably to Lauds. The series of hymns consecrated to Vespers in the
Roman Breviary also form a class apart and help to give us some hints as to the
symbolism of this hour. The hymns are very ancient, dating probably, for the
most part, from the 6th century. They have this particular
characteristic‚Äîthey are all devoted to the praise of one of the days of the
Creation, according to the day of the week, thus: the first, ""Lucis Creator
optime"", on Sunday, to the creation of light; the second, on Monday, to the
separation of the earth and the waters; the third, on Tuesday, to the creation
of the plants; the fourth, on Wednesday, to the creation of the sun and moon;
the fifth, on Thursday, to the creation of the fish; the sixth, on Friday, to
the creation of the beasts of the earth; Saturday is an exception, the hymn on
that day being in honour of the Blessed Trinity, because of the Office of
Sunday then commencing. Importance. We can now see the great importance which
the Church appears to have attached always to the Office of Vespers. It is the
only one which has remained popular (excepting, of course, the Holy Sacrifice
which we do not consider here as an Office) among Roman Catholics up to the
present day. Matins and Lauds, on account of the hour at which they are
celebrated, have always been more or less inaccessible to the faithful;
likewise the little hours, except, perhaps, Terce, which serves as an
introduction to the Mass. Vespers, on the contrary, occupies a privileged place
towards the end of the day. On Sundays it is the Office most likely to bring
the faithful together in church for the second time and thus becomingly
completes the Divine Service for that day. This is why, in the majority of
Catholic countries, the custom of Sunday Vespers has been for so long a time,
and is still, maintained. It is quite conformable to tradition, moreover, to
invest this Office with a particular solemnity. The Vesper psalms, as well as
the hymns and antiphons, are well calculated to edify the faithful. Lastly, the
ancient custom of having a lection or reading from the Old, or New Testament,
or from the homilies of the Fathers, might well in certain cases and to a
certain extent be re-adopted, or serve as the subject-matter for the sermon
which is sometimes delivered at this service. Solemn Vespers before the Second
Vatican Council. On weekdays that are not major feasts Vespers features hardly
any ceremonies and the celebrant wears the usual choir dress. However, on
Sundays and greater feasts Vespers may be solemn. Solemn Vespers differ in that
the celebrant wears the cope, he is assisted by assistants also in copes,
incense is used, and two acolytes, a thurifer, and at least one master of
ceremonies are needed. On ordinary Sundays only two assistants are needed while
on greater feasts four or six assistants may be used. The celebrant and
assistants vest in the surplice and the cope, which is of the color of the day.
The celebrant sits at the sedile, in front of which is placed a lectern,
covered with a cloth in the color of the day. The assistants sit on benches or
stools facing the altar, or if there are two assistants, they may sit at the
sedile next to the celebrant (the first assistant in the place of the deacon
and the second assistant in place of the subdeacon). The celebrant and
assistants follow the acolytes into the church wearing the biretta. Upon
arriving in the sanctuary the acolytes place their candles on the lowest altar
step, after which they are extinguished. The celebrant and assistants kneel on
the lowest step and recite the "Aperi Domine" silently, after which they go to
their places and recite the "Pater noster" and "Ave Maria" silently. A curious
practice which exists from ancient times is the intoning of the antiphons and
psalms to the celebrant. The rubrics presuppose that the first assistant or
cantors will intone all which the celebrant must sing by singing it to him
first in a soft voice after which the celebrant sings it again aloud. The five
antiphons and psalms are sung with the first assistant intoning the antiphons
and the cantors intoning the psalms. During the singing of the psalms all sit.
After the psalms, the acolytes relight their candles and carry them to each
side of the lectern for the chapter. The assistants follow, standing facing
each other in front of the lectern. The celebrant then sings the chapter, after
which all return to their places. The first assistant intones the hymn to the
celebrant, and all stand while the hymn is sung. The first assistant intones
the "Magnificat" to the celebrant, who sings the first line aloud. The
celebrant and the first two assistants go to altar, and the altar is then
incensed as at Mass while the first two assistants hold the ends of the cope.
Other altars in the church may be incensed as well. The first assistant then
incenses the celebrant, after which the thurifer incenses the others as at
Mass. If there are commemorations, the acolytes and assistants again go to the
lectern as described above for the chapter. The choir sings the antiphons, the
cantors sing the versicles, and the celebrant sings the collects. After all
commemorations, the celebrant sings "Dominus vobiscum", the cantor sings
"Benedicamus Domino", and the celebrant sings "Fidelium animae...". The Marian
antiphon is said in the low voice. Especially in English-speaking countries,
Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament often follows Solemn Vespers. Musical
settings of Vespers. The psalms and hymns of the Vespers service have attracted
the interest of many composers, including Claudio Monteverdi, Antonio Vivaldi,
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and Anton Bruckner. (Sergei Rachmaninoff's "Vespers"
is really a setting of the Eastern Orthodox all-night vigil.)
