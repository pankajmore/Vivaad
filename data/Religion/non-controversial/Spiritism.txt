Spiritism Spiritism is a system of explanation of phenomena having in common
the general belief in the survival of a spirit after death. In a stricter
sense, Spiritism is a doctrine founded upon the existence, manifestations and
teachings of the spirits. Compiled in the 19th century by the French educator
Allan Kardec, Spiritism soon spread to other countries, having today 35
representative countries in the International Spiritist Council. Brazil is the
country where the most significant number of adherents can be found. Origins
and geographic distribution. Spiritism is based on the five books of the
Spiritist Codification written by French educator Hypolite L√©on Denizard
Rivail under the pseudonym Allan Kardec reporting s√©ances in which he observed
a series of phenomena that were attributed to incorporeal intelligence
(spirits). His work was later extended by writers like Leon Denis, Jean-
Baptiste Roustaing, Arthur Conan Doyle, Camille Flammarion, Gabriel Delanne,
Ernesto Bozzano, Chico Xavier, Divaldo Pereira Franco, Waldo Vieira, Johannes
Greber and others. Spiritism has adherents in many countries throughout the
world, including Spain, United States, Canada, Japan, Germany, France, England,
Argentina, Portugal and especially in American countries such as Cuba, Jamaica,
and Brazil, which has among the largest proportion and greatest number of
followers. Differences between Spiritism and Spiritualism. Although there are
many similarities between the two, they differ in some fundamental aspects,
particularly regarding man's quest toward spiritual perfection and the manner
by which the followers of each practice their beliefs. Spiritism teaches
reincarnation or rebirth into human life after death. This basically
distinguishes Spiritism from Spiritualism. According to the Spiritist doctrine,
reincarnation explains the moral and intellectual differences among men. It
also provides the path to man's moral and intellectual perfection by amending
for his mistakes and increasing his knowledge in successive lives. For this
reason Spiritism does not accept rebirth in animals as this would be
retrogressive. Allan Kardec refers to Spiritism in "What Is Spiritism?" as a
science dedicated to the relationship between incorporeal beings (spirits) and
human beings. Thus, some spiritists see themselves as not adhering to a
religion, but to a philosophical doctrine with a scientific fulcrum and moral
grounds. On the other hand, many spiritists don't see any problem about
embracing it as a religion as well. Finally, unlike Spiritualism, Spiritism is
not a religious sect but a philosophy or a way of life by which its followers
live by. Its followers have no priests or ministers and do not follow any
religious rituals in their meetings. They also do not call their places of
meetings as churches, and instead call them by various names such as centers,
society or association. Their activities consist mainly of studying the
Spiritist doctrine, applying spiritual healing to the sick and organizing
charitable missions. Kardec reaffirmed that on the cover of his "The Spirit's
Book". Another author in the Spiritualist movement, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
included a chapter about Spiritism in his book "History of Spiritualism"
confirming that Spiritism is Spiritualist (but not vice-versa). As consequence,
many Spiritualist works are widely accepted in Spiritism, particularly the
works of scientists Sir William Crookes, and Sir Oliver Lodge. Such works are
more accepted in anglo-Saxon spiritist communities than in Latin-American ones,
though. In countries like Brazil the movement had spread and became widely
accepted, mostly due to Chico Xavier's works. Today the official spiritist
community has about 20 million adepts, though due to local syncretism, it is
accepted and somehow practiced by three times as many across the country. Some
statistics even mention an adherence to Spiritist practices by 40 million
people in Brazil. The Spiritist moral principles are in agreement with the ones
taught by Jesus (according to Kardec). Other moral examples like Francis of
Assisi, Paul the Apostle, Buddha and Gandhi are also sometimes considered by
the spiritists. Spiritist philosophical inquiry is concerned with the study of
moral aspects in the context of an eternal life in spiritual evolution through
reincarnation, a process believers hold as revealed by Spirits. Sympathetic
research on Spiritism by scientists can be found in the works of Sir William
Crookes, Dr. Robert Hare (Chemist), Sir Oliver J. Lodge, Dr. Emma Bragdon.
Beliefs. Spiritism blends together notions taken from Christianity, Positivism
and Platonism. Basic books. Kardec also wrote a brief introductory pamphlet
("What is Spiritism?") and was the most frequent contributor to the "Spiritist
Review". His essays and articles would be posthumously collected into the aptly
named tome "Posthumous Works". Basic tenets. The central tenet of Spiritist
doctrine is the belief in "spiritual life". The spirit is eternal, and evolves
through a series of incarnations in the material world. The true life is the
spiritual one; life in the material world is just a short-termed stage, where
the spirit has the opportunity to learn and develop its potentials.
Reincarnation is the process where the spirit, once free in the spiritual
world, comes back to the world for further learning. Jesus as a model and guide
in Spiritism. Jesus, according to Spiritism, is the greatest moral example for
humankind, is deemed to have incarnated here to show us, through his example,
the path that we have to take to achieve our own spiritual perfection.
Therefore, Spiritism claims to be a Christian doctrine, claiming it is based on
Jesus Christ's teachings, despite of having an interpretation that differs from
those held by the Church. The Gospels are studied and interpreted in Spiritism;
some of the words of Christ or his actions are clarified in the light of the
spiritual phenomena (presented as law of nature, and not as something
miraculous). Evolution and karma. Spiritist doctrine stresses the importance of
"spiritual evolution". According to this view, humanity is destined for
perfection; there are other planets hosting more advanced life forms and
happier societies, where the spirit has the chance to keep evolving both in the
moral and intellectual sense. Although not clear from Kardec's works, later
spiritist writers elaborated on this point further, claiming humanity cannot
detect more advanced life forms on other planets, as they are living in a
slightly different plane, in the same way the spiritual plane is superimposed
over this plane. Mediumship. The communication between the spiritual world and
the material world happens all the time, but to various degrees. Some people
barely sense what the spirits tell them in an entirely instinctive way, and are
not aware about their influence, while others have greater cognizance of their
guidance. The so-called mediums have these natural abilities highly developed,
and are able to communicate with the spirits and interact with them by several
means: listening, seeing, or writing through spiritual command (also known by
Kardecists as psychography or automatic writing). Unassisted manipulation of
physical objects by spirits is not possible; for it to happen the spirits need
the help (voluntary or not) of mediums with particular abilities for physical
effects. Spiritist practice. Kardec's works do not establish any rituals or
formal practices. Instead, the doctrine suggests that followers adhere to some
principles regarded as common to all religions. The religious experience within
spiritism is, therefore, largely informal. The exception to this is The
National Spiritist Church of Alberta. This Church (which is fully recognized by
the government as a religious denomination) has a Holy Communion Worship
Service and a Marriage Ceremony in addition to the more standard Kardecist
study groups. Organization. Spiritism is not seen as a religion by some of its
followers because it doesn't endorse formal adoration, require regular
frequency or formal membership and claims not to be opposed to science, instead
trying to harmonize with it. There are exceptions, though, as in the country of
Canada, where The National Spiritist Church of Alberta is a government-
recognized religious denomination. For a large part of its followers, the
description of Spiritism is three-fold: science, for its studies on the
mechanisms of mediumship; philosophy, for its theories on the origin, meaning
and importance of life; and religion, for its guidance on a Christian behavior
which will bring spiritual and moral evolution to mankind. It should be noted,
though, that there's no acceptance to Spiritism in mainstream science and that
its belief system fits with the definition of religion (that doesn't include
regular frequency, membership, formal adoration). Spiritism is practiced in
different types of associations (including a Church format in Canada) formal or
not, which can have local, regional, national or international scope. Local
organizations are usually called Spiritist centres or Spiritist societies.
Regional and national organizations are called "federations", as the
Federa√ß√£o Esp√≠rita Brasileira and the Federaci√≥n Esp√≠rita Espa√±ola, while
international organizations are termed "unions", such as the Union Spirite
Fran√ßaise et Francophone. Spiritist centres (or Church in Canada) (especially
in Brazil) are also often active book publishers and promoters of Esperanto.
History. Spiritism shares its roots with many other religions and
denominations, mainly Christianity and Western traditions. It is unknown the
extent of the influence of Hinduism, Buddhism and Shamanism over the doctrinal
aspects of Spiritism, as set by Allan Kardec because the mentions of such
religions are sparse in all his works. Kardec, however, acknowledges the
influence of Socrates and Plato, Jesus and Francis of Assisi; . Precursors.
Developments leading directly to Kardec's research were the famous Fox sisters
and the phenomenon of the Talking boards. Interest in Mesmerism also
contributed to the early Spiritist practice. Swedenborg. From 1747 until his
death in 1772 he lived in Stockholm, Holland and London. During these 25 years
he wrote 14 works of a spiritual nature of which most were published during his
lifetime. Throughout this period he was befriended by many people who regarded
him as a kind and warm-hearted man. Many people disbelieved in his visions;
based on what they had heard, they drew the conclusions that he had lost his
mind or had a vivid imagination. But they refrained from ridiculing him in his
presence. Those who talked with him understood that he was devoted to his
beliefs. He never argued matters of religion, and if obliged to defend himself
he usually did it with gentleness and in a few words. Fox sisters. Sisters
Catherine (1838‚Äì92), Leah (1814‚Äì90) and Margaret (1836‚Äì93) Fox played an
important role in the creation of Spiritualism. The daughters of David and
Margaret Fox, they were residents of Hydesville, New York. In 1848, the family
began to hear unexplained rapping sounds. Kate and Margaret conducted
channeling sessions in an attempt to contact the presumed spiritual entity
creating the sounds, and claimed contact with the spirit of a peddler who was
allegedly murdered and buried beneath the house. A skeleton later found in the
basement seemed to confirm this. The Fox girls became instant celebrities. They
demonstrated their communication with the spirit by using taps and knocks,
automatic writing or psychography, and later even voice communication, as the
spirit took control of one of the girls. Skeptics suspected this was nothing
but clever deception and fraud. Indeed, sister Margaret eventually confessed to
using her toe-joints to produce the sound. And although she later recanted this
confession, both she and her sister Catherine were widely considered
discredited, and died in poverty. Nonetheless, belief in the ability to
communicate with the dead grew rapidly, becoming a religious movement called
Spiritualism, and contributing greatly to Kardec's ideas. Talking boards. Just
after the news of the Fox affair came to France, people became even more
interested in what was sometimes termed the "Spiritual Telegraph". In the
beginning, a table spun with the "energy" from the spirits present by means of
human channeling (hence the term "medium"). But, as the process was too slow
and cumbersome, a new one was devised, supposedly from a suggestion by the
spirits themselves: the talking board. Early examples of talking boards were
baskets attached to a pointy object that spun under the hands of the mediums,
to point at letters printed on cards scattered around, or engraved on, the
table. Such devices were called "corbeille √  bec" ("basket with a beak"). The
pointy object was usually a pencil. Talking boards were tricky to set up and to
operate. A typical s√©ance using a talking board saw people sitting at a round
table, feet resting on the chairs' supports and hands on the table top or,
later, on the talking board itself. The energy channeled from the spirits
through their hands made the board spin around and find letters which, once
written down by a scribe, would form intelligible words, phrases, and
sentences. The system was an early, and less effective, precursor of the Ouija
boards that later became so popular. Allan Kardec first became interested in
Spiritism when he learned of the Fox sisters, but his first contact with what
would become the doctrine was by means of talking boards. Some of the earlier
parts of his Spirits' Book were channeled this way. Franz Mesmer. Franz Anton
Mesmer (May 23, 1734 ‚Äì March 5, 1815) discovered what he called "magn√©tisme
animal" (animal magnetism) and others often called "mesmerism". The evolution
of Mesmer's ideas and practices led Scottish surgeon James Braid (1795‚Äì1860)
to develop hypnotism in 1841. Spiritism incorporated and kept some practices
inspired or directly taken from Mesmerism. Among them, the healing touch, still
in Europe, and the energization of water to be used as a medicine for spirit
and body. Recent history of Spiritism. Chico Xavier. Francisco C√¢ndido Xavier
(April 2, 1910 - June 30, 2002) was a popular medium in Brazil¬¥s spiritism
movement who wrote more than 400 books and about 10 thousand letters to family
members of deceased people, ostensibly using psychography. His books sold
millions of copies, all of which had their proceeds entirely donated to
charity. They included books on poetry, novels, and even scientific treatises.
Some of which are considered by Brazilian spiritist followers to be fundamental
for the comprehension of the practical and theoretical aspects of Allan
Kardec's doctrine. One of his most famous, The Astral City, which details one
experience after dying, is available as a free e-book from the Spiritist Group
of New York online. Chico Xavier appeared on Brazilian television several
times, contributing to the rise of spiritism in Brazil. Spiritism in popular
culture. Soap operas. In Brazil four soap operas have used the concepts of
Spiritism. Terra Nostra included a subplot of a young man obsessed by the
spirit of his mother's youth lover who had been killed by his grandfather.
Criticisms. Before World War I. Spiritism began attracting criticisms almost
immediately once formulated. Kardec's own introductory book on Spiritism, "What
is Spiritism?", published only two years after "The Spirits Book", includes a
long dialogue between his persona and three idealized critics, "The Critic",
"The Skeptic", and "The Priest", which as a whole summed up most of the
criticism Spiritism has received since then: of being charlatanism,
pseudoscience, heresy, anti-Catholic, witchcraft, and/or a form of Satanism. In
further books and articles published in his periodical, the "Revue Spirite",
Kardec kept addressing these and other criticisms until his death in 1869.
Later, a new source of criticism came from Occultist movements such as the
Theosophical Society, a competing new religion, which saw the Spiritist
explanations as too simple or even na√Øve. Interwar period. The interwar period
saw the development of a new form of criticism towards Spiritism: Ren√©
Gu√©non's influential book "The Spiritist Fallacy", which criticized both the
more general concepts of Spiritualism, which he considered to be a superficial
mix of moralism and spiritual materialism, as well as Spiritism's specific
contributions, such as its belief in what he saw as a post-Cartesian, modernist
concept of reincarnation that is distinct from and opposed to its two western
predecessors, metempsychosis and transmigration. Post‚ÄìWorld War II. In the
Catechism of the Catholic Church (paragraph 2117) one can read that "Spiritism
often implies divination or magical practices; the Church for her part warns
the faithful against it". In Brazil, Catholic priests Dom Carlos Jos√©
Boaventura Kloppenburg and Oscar Gonz√°lez Quevedo, among others, have since
the 1960s written extensively against Spiritism from both a doctrinal and
parapsychologic perspective. Quevedo, in particular, has dedicated himself to
show that Spiritism's claims of being a science are invalid, having not only
written books on the subject but also hosted paranormal debunking shows on
television, the most recent of which a series that ran in 2000 on Globo's
hugely popular Sunday prime time news show Fant√°stico. Brazilian Spiritists,
such as Dr. Hernani Guimar√£es Andrade, have in turn written rebuttals to these
criticisms. Scientific skeptics also target Spiritism frequently in books,
media appearances, and online forums, accusing it of being a pseudoscience. The
ex-spiritist and medium Waldo Vieira, accepting this criticism but not the idea
that it cannot become a science, left Spiritism to start a new, Spiritist-
inspired movement called Projectiology.
