Jewish holiday Jewish holidays, observed by Jews throughout the year, have
three principal sources: Biblical mitzvot (commandments), rabbinical mandate,
and modern Israeli history. General Concepts. Groupings. Certain terms are used
very commonly for groups of holidays. Terminology Used to Describe Holidays.
Shabbat (×©×‘×ª) (Ashkenazi pron. from Yid. "shabbos"), or Sabbath, is referred
to by that name exclusively. Similarly, Rosh Chodesh (×¨××© ×—×•×–×©) is
referred to by that name exclusively. "Work" on Sabbath and Biblical Holidays.
In principle, Conservative Judaism understands the requirement to refrain from
"melacha" in the same way as Orthodox Judaism. In practice, Conservative rabbis
frequently rule on prohibitions around "melacha" differently from Orthodox
authorities. Still, there are a number of Conservative (or Masorti) communities
around the world where Sabbath and Festival observance fairly closely resembles
Orthodox observance. However, many, if not most, lay members of Conservative
congregations in North America do not consider themselves Sabbath-observant,
even by Conservative standards. At the same time, adherents to Progressive
Judaism, including Reform Judaism and Reconstructionist Judaism, do not accept
"halacha", and therefore restrictions on "melacha," as binding at all. Jews
fitting any of these descriptions refrain from "melacha" in practice only as
they personally see fit. Holidays of Biblical and Rabbinic (Talmudic) Origin.
Shabbat â€” The Sabbath. Jewish law "(halacha)" accords Shabbat (×©×‘×ª) the
status of a holiday, a day of rest celebrated on the seventh day of each week.
Jewish law defines a day as ending at either sundown or nightfall, when the
next day then begins. Thus, In many ways "halakha" (Jewish law) sees "Shabbat"
as the most important holy day in the Jewish calendar. Rosh Chodesh â€” The New
Month. Rosh Chodesh (×¨××© ×—×•×“×©) (lit., "head of the month") is a minor
holiday or observance occuring on the first day of each month of the Jewish
calendar, as well as the last day of the preceding month if it has thirty days.
Beyond the preceding, current observance is limited to changes in liturgy.
"Related observances:" Rosh Hashanah â€” The Jewish New Year. Selichot. During
the month of Elul that precedes Rosh Hashanah, additional penitential prayers
called Selichot are added to the daily prayers, except on Shabbat. Sephardi
Jews add these prayers each weekday during Elul. Ashkenazi Jews recite them
from the last Sunday (or Saturday night) preceding Rosh Hashanah that allows at
least four days of recitations. Rosh Hashanah. According to oral tradition,
Rosh Hashanah (×¨××© ×”×©× ×”) (lit., "Head of the Year") is the Day of
Memorial or Remembrance (×™×•× ×”×–×›×¨×•×Ÿ, "Yom HaZikaron"), and the day of
judgment (×™×•× ×”×“×™×Ÿ, "Yom HaDin"). God judges each person individually
according to his/her deeds, and makes a decree for the following year. The
holiday is characterized by the specific mitzvah of blowing the "shofar."
According to the Torah, this is the first day of the seventh month of the
calendar year, and marks the beginning of a ten day period leading up to Yom
Kippur. According to an opinion in Jewish oral tradition, the creation of the
world was completed on Rosh Hashanah. The recitation of "Tashlikh" occurs
during the afternoon of the first day. Officially North American Reform Judaism
celebrates two days of Rosh Hashanah, but a significant number of Reform
congregations and members celebrate only one day. The non-Reform branches of
Judaism celebrate it as a two-day holiday, both inside and outside the
boundaries of Israel. The two days are considered together to be a single "yoma
arichta" (Aramaic, "long day"). Four New Years. None of these four dates bears
much resemblance to the American/Western holiday New Year's Day. Aseret Yemei
Teshuva â€” Ten Days of Repentance. The first ten days of Tishrei (from the
beginning of Rosh Hashana until the end of Yom Kippur) are known as the Ten
Days of Repentance (×¢×©×¨×ª ×™××™ ×ª×©×•×‘×”, "Aseret Yemei Teshuva)." During
this time, in anticipation of Yom Kippur, it is "exceedingly appropriate" for
Jews to practice "teshuvah" (literally "return"), an examination of one's deeds
and repentance for sins one has committed against other people and God. This
repentance can take the form of additional supplications, confessing one's
deeds before God, fasting, self-reflection, and an increase of involvement
with, or donations to, charity. Tzom Gedalia â€“ Fast of Gedalia. The Fast of
Gedalia (×¦×•× ×’×“×œ×™×”) is a minor Jewish fast day observed from dawn until
dusk. It commemorates the assassination of the righteous governor of Judah of
that name, which ended any level of Jewish rule following the destruction of
the First Temple. Yom Kippur â€” Day of Atonement. Yom Kippur (×™×•×
×›×™×¤×•×¨) is the holiest day of the year for Jews. Its central theme is
atonement and reconciliation. This is accomplished through prayer and complete
fasting â€“ including abstinence from all food and drink (including water) â€“
by all healthy adults. Bathing, wearing of perfume or cologne, wearing of
leather shoes, and sexual relations are some of the other prohibitions on Yom
Kippur - all them designed to ensure one's attention is completely and
absolutely focused on the quest for atonement with God. Yom Kippur is also
unique among holidays as having work-related restrictions identical to those of
Sabbath. The fast and other prohibitions commence on 10 Tishri at sunset -
sunset being the "beginning" of the day in Jewish tradition. A traditional
Aramaic prayer called "Kol Nidre" ("All Vows") is traditionally recited just
before sunset. Although often regarded as the start of the Yom Kippur evening
service â€“ to such a degree that "Erev Yom Kippur" ("Yom Kippur Evening") is
often called "Kol Nidre" (also spelled "Kol Nidrei") â€“ it is technically a
separate tradition. This is especially so because, being recited before sunset,
it is actually recited on 9 Tishri, which is the day "before" Yom Kippur; it is
not recited on Yom Kippur itself (on 10 Tishri, which begins "after" the sun
sets). In traditional communities, men wear the "kittel" throughout the day's
prayers. A "Tallit" (four-cornered prayer shawl) is donned for evening and
afternoon prayersâ€“the only day of the year in which this is done. The prayers
on Yom Kippur evening are lengthier than on any other night of the year. Once
services reconvene in the morning, the services (in all traditions) are the
longest of the year. In some traditional synagogues prayers run continuously
from morning until nightfall, or nearly so. Two highlights of the morning
prayers in traditional synagogues are the recitation of "Yizkor," the prayer of
remembrance, and of liturgical poems "(piyyutim)" describing the temple service
of Yom Kippur. Two other highlights happen late in the day. During the
"Minchah" prayer, the haftarah reading features the entire Book of Jonah.
Finally, the day concludes with "Ne'ilah," a special service recited only on
the day of Yom Kippur. Ne'ilah deals with the closing of the holiday, and
contains a fervent final plea to God for forgiveness just before the conclusion
of the fast. Yom Kippur comes to an end with the blowing of the "shofar", which
marks the conclusion of the fast. It is always observed as a one-day holiday,
both inside and outside the boundaries of the Land of Israel. Yom Kippur is
considered, along with 15th of Av, as the happiest days of the year (Talmud
Bavli - Tractate Ta'anit). Sukkot â€” Feast of Booths (or Tabernacles). Sukkot
(×¡×•×›×•×ª or ×¡Ö»×›Ö¼×•Ö¹×ª, "sukkÅt") or "Succoth" is a seven-day festival,
also known as the Feast of Booths, the Feast of Tabernacles, or just
Tabernacles. It is one of the Three Pilgrimage Festivals ("shalosh regalim")
mentioned in the Bible. Sukkot commemorates the years that the Jews spent in
the desert on their way to the Promised Land, and celebrates the way in which
God protected them under difficult desert conditions. The word "sukkot" is the
plural of the Hebrew word "sukkah", meaning booth. Jews are commanded to
"dwell" in booths during the holiday. This generally means taking meals, but
some sleep in the "sukkah" as well, particularly in Israel. There are specific
rules for constructing a "sukkah". Along with dwelling in a "sukkah," the
principal ritual unique to this holiday is use of the Four Species ("lulav"
(palm), "hadass" (myrtle), "aravah" (willow) and "etrog" (citron). On each day
of the holiday other than Shabbat, these are waved in association with the
recitation of Hallel in the synagogue, then walked in a procession around the
synagogue called the "Hoshanot". The seventh day of the Sukkot is called
Hoshanah Rabbah, the "Great "Hoshanah"" (singular of "Hoshanot" and the source
of the English word hosanna). The climax of the day's prayers includes seven
processions of "Hoshanot" around the synagogue. This tradition mimics practices
from the Temple in Jerusalem. Many aspects of the day's customs also resemble
those of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. Hoshanah Rabbah is traditionally taken
to be the day of the "delivery" of the final judgment of Yom Kippur, and offers
a last opportunity for pleas of repentance before the holiday season closes.
Outside of Israel, meals are still taken in the Sukkah on the eighth day,
Shemini Atzeret, a holiday in its own right. (See following section.) Shemini
Atzeret and Simchat Torah. The holiday of Shemini Atzeret (×©××™× ×™ ×¢×¦×¨×ª)
immediately follows the conclusion of the holiday of Sukkot. The Hebrew word
"shemini" means "eighth," and refers to its position on "the eighth day" of
Sukkot, actually a seven-day holiday. This name reflects the fact that while in
many respects Shemini Atzeret is a separate holiday in its own right, in
certain respects its celebration is linked to that of Sukkot. The main notable
custom of this holiday is the celebration of Simchat Torah (×©××—×ª ×ª×•×¨×”),
meaning "rejoicing with the Torah." This name originally referred to a special
"ceremony": the last weekly Torah portion is read from Deuteronomy, completing
the annual cycle, and is followed immediately by the reading of the first
chapter of Genesis, beginning the new annual cycle. Services are especially
joyous, and all attendees, young and old, are involved. This ceremony so
dominates the holiday that in Israel, where the holiday is one day long, the
whole holiday is often referred to as "Simchat Torah." Outside Israel, the
holiday is two days long; the name "Shemini Atzeret" is used for the first day,
while the second is normally called "Simchat Torah." Hanukkah â€” Festival of
Lights. The story of Hanukkah (×—× ×•×›×”) is preserved in the books of the
First and Second Maccabees. These books are not part of the Tanakh (Hebrew
Bible), they are apocryphal books instead. The miracle of the one-day supply of
olive oil miraculously lasting eight days is first described in the Talmud
(Shabbat 21b), written about 600 years after the events described in the books
of Maccabees. Hanukkah marks the defeat of Seleucid Empire forces that had
tried to prevent the people of Israel from practicing Judaism. Judah Maccabee
and his brothers destroyed overwhelming forces, and rededicated the Temple in
Jerusalem. The eight-day festival is marked by the kindling of lights â€” one
on the first night, two on the second, and so on â€” using a special candle
holder called a "Chanukkiyah", or a "Hanukkah menorah." Tenth of Tevet. This
minor fast day marks the beginning of the siege of Jerusalem as outlined in 2
Kings 25:1 As a minor fast day, fasting from dawn to dusk is required, but
other laws of mourning are not observed. A Torah reading and Haftorah reading,
and a special prayer in the Amidah, are added at both Shacharit and Mincha
services. Tu Bishvat â€” New Year of the Trees. Tu Bishvat is the new year for
trees. According to the Mishnah, it marks the day from which fruit tithes are
counted each year, and marks the timepoint from which the Biblical prohibition
on eating the first three years of fruit and the requirement to bring the
fourth year fruit to the Temple in Jerusalem were counted. In modern times, it
is celebrated by eating various fruits and nuts associated with the Land of
Israel. During the 17th century, Rabbi Yitzchak Luria of Safed and his
disciples created a short seder, called "Hemdat haâ€‘Yamim", reminiscent of the
seder that Jews observe on Passover, that explores the holiday's Kabbalistic
themes. Traditionally, trees are planted on this day. Many children collect
funds leading up to this day to plant trees in Israel. Trees are usually
planted locally as well. Purim â€” Festival of Lots. Purim (×¤×•×¨×™×)
commemorates the events that took place in the Book of Esther. It is celebrated
by reading or acting out the story of Esther, and by making disparaging noises
at every mention of Haman's name. On Purim it is a tradition to masquerade in
costumes and to give "Mishloakh Manot" (gifts of food and drink) to friends, as
well as "Matanot La'evyonim" (gifts to the poor and the needy). Purim
celebrations conclude with a festive meal, the "Se'udat Purim" (or "Purim
Se'udah"). This meal is traditionally accompanied by consumption of alcohol,
often heavy, although Jewish sages have warned about the need to adhere to all
religious laws even in a drunken state. In Israel it is also a tradition to
arrange festive parades, known as "Ad-D'lo-Yada", in the town's main street.
Sometimes the children dress up and act out the story of Esther for their
parents. Pesach â€” Passover. Passover is one of the three pilgrimage festivals
("Shalosh regalim") ordained in the Torah. Pesach commemorates the liberation
of the Israelite slaves from Egypt. No leavened food is eaten during the week
of Pesach, in commemoration of the fact that the Jews left Egypt so quickly
that their bread did not have enough time to rise. The first seder begins at
sundown on the 15th of Nisan, and the second seder (outside Israel) is held on
the night of the 16th of Nisan. On the second night, Jews start counting the
"omer". The Counting of the Omer is a count of the days from the time they left
Egypt until the time they arrived at Mount Sinai. Sefirah â€” Counting of the
Omer. Sefirah is the 49 day ("seven weeks") period between Pesach and Shavuot;
it is defined by the Torah as the period during which special offerings are to
be brought to the Temple in Jerusalem. Judaism teaches that this makes physical
the spiritual connection between Pesach and Shavuot. Lag Ba'omer. Lag Ba'omer
() is the 33rd day in the Omer count ( is the number 33 in Hebrew). The
mourning restrictions on joyous activities during the Omer period are lifted on
Lag Ba'Omer and there are often celebrations with picnics, bonfires and bow and
arrow play by children. In Israel, youth can be seen gathering materials for
bonfires. Shavuot â€” Feast of Weeks â€” Yom HaBikurim. Shavuot, The Feast of
Weeks, is one of the three pilgrimage festivals ("Shalosh regalim") ordained in
the Torah. Shavuot marks the end of the counting of the "Omer", the period
between Passover and Shavuot. According to Rabbinic tradition, the Ten
Commandments were given on this day. During this holiday the Torah portion
containing the Ten Commandments is read in the synagogue, and the biblical Book
of Ruth is read as well. It is traditional to eat dairy meals during Shavuot.
Seventeenth of Tammuz. The 17th of Tammuz traditionally marks the first breach
in the walls of the Second Temple during the Roman occupation. As a minor fast
day, fasting from dawn to dusk is required, but other laws of mourning are not
observed. A Torah reading and Haftorah reading, and a special prayer in the
Amidah, are added at both Shacharit and Mincha services. The Three Weeks and
the Nine Days. The days between the 17th of Tammuz and the 9th of Av are days
of mourning, on account of the collapse of Jerusalem during the Roman
occupation which occurred during this time framework. Weddings and other joyful
occasions are traditionally not held during this period. A further element is
added within the three weeks, during the nine days between the 1st and 9th day
of Av â€” the pious refrain from eating meat and drinking wine, except on
"Shabbat" or at a "Seudat Mitzvah" (a Mitzvah meal, such as a "Pidyon Haben"
â€” the recognition of a firstborn male child â€” or the study completion of a
religious text.) In addition, one's hair is not cut during this period. In
Conservative Judaism, the Rabbinical Assembly's Committee on Jewish Law and
Standards has issued several responsa (legal rulings) which hold that the
prohibitions against weddings in this timeframe are deeply held traditions, but
should not be construed as binding law. Thus, Conservative Jewish practice
would allow weddings during this time, except on the 9th of Av itself. Reform
Judaism and Reconstructionist Judaism hold that halakha (Jewish law) is no
longer binding, and rabbis in those movements follow their individual
consciences on such matters; some uphold the traditional prohibitions and some
permit weddings on these days. Orthodox Judaism maintains the traditional
prohibitions. Tisha B'av â€” Ninth of Av. Tisha B'Av is a fast day that
commemorates two of the saddest events in Jewish history that both occurred on
the ninth of Av â€” the destruction in 586 BCE of the First Temple, originally
built by King Solomon, and destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE. Other
calamities throughout Jewish history are said to have taken place on Tisha
B'Av, including King Edward I's edict compelling the Jews to leave England
(1290) and the Jewish expulsion from Spain in 1492. Tu B'av. Tu B'av is a day
mentioned in the Talmud alongside Yom Kippur as "happiest of the year." It was
a day celebrating the bringing of wood used for the Temple Service, as well as
a day when marriages were arranged. In modern Israel, the day has become
somewhat of an analog to Valentine's Day. Israeli/Jewish national holidays and
days of remembrance. Since the creation of the State of Israel in 1948, the
Chief Rabbinate of Israel has established four new holidays and days of
remembrance. These four days are national holidays or days of remembrance in
the State of Israel. They have been accepted as religious holidays by the
following groups: The Union of Orthodox Congregations and the Rabbinical
Council of America; The United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth; Reform
Judaism; Conservative Judaism; Reconstructionist Judaism; the Union for
Traditional Judaism. These four new days are not accepted as religious holidays
by all forms of Haredi Judaism, including Hasidic Judaism. These groups view
these new days as secular innovations, and they do not celebrate these
holidays. Yom HaShoah â€” Holocaust Remembrance day. Yom HaShoah is also known
as Holocaust Remembrance Day, and takes place on the 27th day of Nisan. If this
date falls on a Friday, the observance is moved to the previous Thursday. If it
falls on a Sunday, observance is moved to the following Monday. Yom Hazikaron
â€” Memorial Day. Yom Hazikaron is the day of remembrance in honor of Israeli
veterans and fallen soldiers of the Wars of Israel. The Memorial Day also
commemorates fallen civilians, slain by acts of hostile terrorism. Yom
Ha'atzmaut â€” Israel Independence Day. Yom Ha'atzmaut is Israel's Independence
Day. An official ceremony is held annually on the eve of Yom Ha'atzmaut at
Mount Herzl. The ceremony includes speeches by senior Israeli officials, an
artistic presentation, a ritual march of flag-carrying soldiers forming
elaborate structures (such as a Menorah, a Magen David and the number which
represents the age of the State of Israel) and the lighting of twelve beacons
(one for each of the Tribes of Israel). Dozens of Israeli citizens, who
contributed significantly to the state, are selected to light these beacons.
Yom Yerushalayim â€” Jerusalem Day. Jerusalem Day marks the 1967 reunification
of Jerusalem and The Temple Mount under Jewish rule during the Six-Day War
almost 1900 years after the destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem.
Position of Jewish religious holidays in Israel. As a general rule, the four
days above, the Biblical Jewish holidays (Sabbath, Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur,
Three Pilgrimage Festivals) and Purim are observed as holidays in Israel.
Chanukah is a school holiday, but businesses remain open. Other Jewish holidays
listed above are observed in varying ways and to varying degrees. However, this
general rule does not fully apply to non-Jewish communities inside Israel.
