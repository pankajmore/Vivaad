Legends surrounding the papacy The papacy has been surrounded by numerous
legends. Among the most famous are the claims that the Papal Tiara contains the
"number of the beast" inscriptions on the Tiara, that a woman was once elected
pope, or that current pope, Benedict XVI, will be the Pope. The first two
claims have been independently determined to be false. Vicarius Filii Dei. One
misconception surrounding the Papal Tiara suggests that the words (Latin for
"Vicar of the Son of God") exist on the side of one of the tiaras. The story
centres on the widely made claim that, when numerised (i.e., when those letters
in the 'title' that have roman numeral value are added together), they produce
the number 666, described in the Book of Revelation as the number of the Beast
(the Antichrist) which wears multiple crowns identified by some as the triple
tiara). This claim has been made by some Protestant sects who believe that the
Pope, as head of the Roman Catholic Church "is" the Beast or the False Prophet
mentioned in the Book of Revelation. However, a detailed examination of the
existing tiaras shows no such decoration. Further, is "not" among the titles of
the Pope; the closest match is ("Vicar of Christ", also rendered in English as
"Vicar of Jesus Christ"), the numerical values of which do "not" add up to 666,
but to 214. There is also a dispute on the numerology of and . Latin does not
have the letter 'U' but instead uses 'V'; only if one uses the correct Latin
spelling VICARIVSÂ·FILIIÂ·DEI is the total produced (VICIVILIIDI =
5Â +Â 1Â +Â 100Â +Â 1Â +Â 5Â +Â 1Â +Â 50Â +Â 1Â +Â 1Â +Â 500Â +Â 1 =Â 666) (,
the real title, comes up to 214). Otherwise, the numbers add up to 661 and 209.
It is also important to note that when written out in proper Roman numerals,
666 is actually written as DCLXVI. Pope Joan. The claim that a woman, often
called Pope Joan, became pope first appeared in a Dominican chronicle in 1250.
It soon spread Europe-wide through preaching Friars. The story grew in
embellishment but centred on a set of claims. The time period for this claim is
traditionally given as AD 855â€“858, between the reigns of Leo IV and Benedict
III; however, this possibility is unlikely, because Leo IV died on 17 July 855,
and Benedict III was elected as his successor on 29 September of the same year.
Jean de Mailly, a French Dominican at Metz, places the story in the year 1099,
in his , which dates from approximately 1250 and gives what is almost certainly
the earliest authentic account of the woman who became known as Pope Joan. His
compatriot Stephen of Bourbon acknowledges this by placing her rule at
approximately 1100. Also, Rosemary and Darrell Pardoe, authors of "The Female
Pope: The Mystery of Pope Joan. The First Complete Documentation of the Facts
behind the Legend", are assuming that a more plausible time-frame would be
1086â€“1108, when there were a lot of antipopes, and the reign of the
legitimate popes Victor III, Urban II and Paschal II was not always established
in Rome, since this city was occupied by Emperor Henry IV, and later sacked by
the Normans. Generally, there are two versions of the legend. "Joan" disguises
herself as a monk, called Joannes Anglicus. In time, she rose to the highest
office of the church, becoming a pope. After two or five years of reign, 'Pope
Joan' became pregnant, and during an Easter procession, she gave birth to the
child on the streets when she fell off a horse. She was publicly stoned to
death by the astonished crowd, and according to the legend, removed from the
Vatican archives. As a consequence, certain traditions stated that popes
throughout the medieval period were required to undergo a procedure wherein
they sat on a special chair with a hole in the seat. A cardinal would have the
task of putting his hand up the hole to check whether the pope had testicles,
or doing a visual examination. This procedure is not taken seriously by most
historians, and there is no documented instance. It is probably a scurrilous
legend based on the existence of two ancient stone chairs with holes in the
seats that probably dated from Roman times and may have been used because of
their ancient imperial origins. Their original purpose is obscure. In a
seventeenth-century study, Protestant historian David Blondel argued that 'Pope
Joan' is a fictitious story. The story may well be a satire that came to be
believed as reality. This view is generally accepted among historians. Prophecy
of the Popes. Some hold that the current pope, Benedict XVI, will be the Pope,
based on the Prophecy of the Popes. Documents of Jesus Christ. It is sometimes
claimed that there exists a collection of documents that directly refer to
Jesus, such as the execution order for Jesus signed by Pontius Pilate, or were
personally written by Jesus, explaining to his followers how to conduct the
formation of the Catholic Church after his death, or even the exact date of his
return to judge mankind. These documents are said to be a closely guarded
secret of the Catholic Church, and supposedly are hidden in the Vatican Secret
Archives, or at past times in an underground vault in the event that Nazi
Germany would invade the Vatican. However there is no solid evidence for any of
these claims; in history, there has been only one document that was attributed
to Jesus himself, the Letter of Christ and Abgarus. Scholars generally believe
that those letters were fabricated, probably in the 3rd century AD. Even in
ancient times, Augustine and Jerome contended that Jesus wrote nothing at all
during his life. The correspondence was rejected as apocryphal by Pope Gelasius
I and a Roman synod (c. 495).
