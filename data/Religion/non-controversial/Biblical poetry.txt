Biblical poetry The ancient Hebrews perceived that there were poetical portions
in their sacred texts, as shown by their entitling as songs or chants passages
such as Exodus 15:1-19 and Numbers 21:17-20; a song or chant ("shir") is,
according to the primary meaning of the term, poetry. The question whether the
poetical passages of the Old Testament show signs of regular rhythm or meter is
yet unsolved. Characteristics of Ancient Hebrew poetry. Rhyme. It is often
stated that ancient Hebrew poetry contains almost no rhyme. This assertion is
understandable because the ancient texts preserved in the Hebrew Bible were
written over a period of at least a millennium. Over that length of time, the
pronunciation of every language changes. Words that were rhyming pairs at the
beginning of that period may no longer rhyme at the end of that period.
Further, different tribal groups or other groups of Hebrew speakers undoubtedly
pronounced words differently in one and the same era. Using English as an
example, we would be hard-pressed to find rhyme or even meter in the opening
verses of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, written in Middle English, if we were to
pronounce the words of that poem as we pronounce their direct descendants in
Modern English. Even within contemporary English, some speakers rhyme "again"
with "rain" while others rhyme "again" with "pen." The phonological phenomena
that obscure the rhymes of Chaucer only 600 years after his death, are also to
be found in Biblical Hebrew texts which spanned a millennium. One fine example
of rhyme and meter in ancient Hebrew texts is found in the Book of Proverbs, 6:
9, 10. As Hebraist Seth Ben-Mordecai (author, "The Exodus Haggadah") points
out, these two verses, split into four lines of poetry, demonstrate both
internal rhyme (common to Biblical Hebrew texts) and end-of-line rhyme (less
common in Hebrew but the norm in English rhyming poetry), as well as noticeable
meter. Thus, the last word of the first line ('AD maTAI 'aTZEL tishKAV) rhymes
with the last word of the last line (me'AT khibBUQ yaDAYM lishKAV). In the
third line, the second and fourth words create an internal rhyme with each
other (me'AT sheNOT, me'AT tenuMOT). Finally, the first word of the second line
(maTAI taQUM mishshenaTEksgha) is identical to the first word of the first
line, linking those two lines even without obvious rhyme. Similar rhyming
verses within the Hebrew Bible ought to put to rest the . It is sometimes
stated that ancient Hebrew texts demonstrate assonance more often than rhyme.
Indeed, assonance is prominent in ancient Hebrew texts - as are other forms of
"sound matching." An example of assonance is found in the first song mentioned
above (Exodus 15:1-19), where assonance occurs at the ends of the lines, as in
"anwehu" and "aromemenhu" (15:2). It is, of course, true that consonance of
"hu" (= "him") can occur frequently in the Hebrew, because the language allows
speakers to affix object-case as suffixes to verbs. What is notable when
comparing ancient Hebrew poetry to contemporary English poetry is the
playfulness of the authors, and their evident willingness to use multiple
sound-matching schemes, rather than limiting themselves to simple rhymes at the
end of verses, as in English. Unusual forms. The employment of unusual forms of
language cannot be considered as a sign of ancient Hebrew poetry. In the
sentences of Noah the form "lamo" occurs. But this form, which represents
partly "lahem" and partly "lo", has many counterparts in Hebrew grammar, as,
for example, "kemo" instead of "ke"; or "emo" = "them"; or "emo" = "their"; or
"clemo" = "to them"â€”forms found in passages for which no claim to poetical
expressions is made. Then there are found "á¸¥ayeto" = "beast", "osri" =
"tying", and "yeshu'atah" = "salvation"â€”three forms that probably retain
remnants of the old endings of the nominative, genitive, and accusative: "u
(n)," "i(n)," "a(n)." Again, in Lamech's words, "Adah and Zillah, hear my
voice; ye wives of Lamech, harken unto my speech", the two words "he'ezin" and
"imrah" attract attention, because they occur for the first time in this
passage, although there had been an earlier opportunity of using them: in
Genesis 3:8 and 3:10, "He'ezin" = "to harken" could have been used just as well
as its synonym "shama'" = "to hear". Furthermore, "imrah" = "speech" might have
been used instead of the essentially identical "dabar" in Genesis 9:1 and
following, but its earliest use is, as stated above, in Genesis 4:23. In place
of "adam" = "man" "enosh" is employed. (compare the Aramaic "enash"). A
systematic review of similar unusual forms of Hebrew grammar and Hebrew words
occurring in certain portions of the Old Testament. Such forms have been called
"dialectus poetica" since the publication of Robert Lowth's "PrÃ¦lectiones de
Sacra Poesi HebrÃ¦orum" iii. (1753); but this designation is ambiguous and can
be accepted only in agreement with the rule "a parte potiori fit denominatio"
for some of these unusual forms and words are found elsewhere than in the
"songs" of the Old Testament. These unusual forms and expressions do not occur
in all songs, and there are several Psalms that have none of these
peculiarities. Parallelism. Not even the "parallelismus membrorum" is an
absolutely certain indication of ancient Hebrew poetry. This "parallelism" is a
phenomenon noticed in the portions of the Old Testament that are at the same
time marked frequently by the so-called "dialectus poetica"; it consists in a
remarkable correspondence in the ideas expressed in two successive verses; for
example, the above-cited words of Lamech, "Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; ye
wives of Lamech, harken unto my speech", in which are found "he'ezin" and
"imrah," show a remarkable repetition of the same thought. Julius Ley says
therefore correctly that This restriction must be made to James Robertson's
view: "The distinguishing feature of the Hebrew poetry ... is the rhythmical
balancing of parts, or parallelism of thought." Quantitative Rhythm. The poetry
of the ancient Hebrews is not distinguished from the other parts of the Old
Testament by rhythm based on quantity, though in view of Greek and Roman poetry
it was natural to seek such a rhythm in the songs and Psalms of the Old
Testament. William Jones, for example, attempted to prove that there was a
definite sequence of long and short syllables in the ancient Hebrew poems; but
he could support this thesis only by changing the punctuation in many ways, and
by allowing great license to the Hebrew poets. However, on reading the portions
of the Old Testament marked by the so-called "dialectus poetica" or by
parallelism (e.g., Genesis 4:23 and following) no such sequence of long and
short syllables can be discovered; and Sievers says: "Hebrew prosody is not
based on quantity as classical prosody is." Accentual rhythm. Many scholars
hold that the Hebrew poet considered only the syllables receiving the main
accent, and did not count the intervening ones. Examples contrary to this are
not found in passages where forms of the so-called "dialectus poetica" are
used, as Ley holds; and Israel Davidson has proved that the choice of "lamo"
instead of "lahem" favors in only a few passages the opinion that the poet
intended to cause an accented syllable to be followed by an unaccented one. n:
"Lines with two, three, four, and five accented syllables may be distinguished,
between which one to three, and even four, unaccented syllables may be
inserted, the poet being bound by no definite number in his poem. Occasionally
two accented syllables are joined" ("PalÃ¤stinischer Diwan", 1901, p23).
Sievers is inclined to restrict Hebrew rhythm by various rules, as he attacks
Karl Budde's view, that Furthermore, the verse of the Old Testament poetry is
naturally iambic or anapestic, as the words are accented on one of the final
syllables. The Dirges. A special kind of rhythm may be observed in the dirges,
called by the Hebrews "kinot". A whole book of these elegies is contained in
the Hebrew Bible, the first of them beginning thus: "How does the city sit
solitaryâ€”that was full of peopleâ€”how is she become as a widowâ€”she that
was great among the nationsâ€”and princess among the provincesâ€”how is she
become tributary!" (Lamentations 1:1). The rhythm of such lines lies in the
fact that a longer line is always followed by a shorter one. As in the
hexameter and pentameter of Greek poetry, this change was intended to symbolize
the idea that a strenuous advance in life is followed by fatigue or reaction.
This rhythm, which may be designated "elegiac measure," occurs also in Amos 5:
2, expressly designated as a á¸³inah. The sad import of his prophecies induced
Jeremiah also to employ the rhythm of the dirges several times in his
utterances (Jeremiah 9:20, 13:18 and following). He refers here expressly to
the "meá¸³onenot" (the mourning women) who in the East still chant the death-
song to the trembling tone of the pipe (48:36 and following). "á¸²inot" are
found also in Ezekiel 19:1, 26:17, 27:2, 32:2 and following, 32:16, 32:19 and
following. This elegiac measure, being naturally a well-known one, was used
also elsewhere, as, for example, in Psalm 19:8-10. The rhythm of the á¸³inah
has been analyzed especially by Budde (in Stade's "Zeitschrift", 1883, p299).
Similar funeral songs of the modern Arabs are quoted by Wetzstein (in
"Zeitschrift fÃ¼r Ethnologie", v. 298), as, e.g.: "O, if he only could be
ransomed! truly, I would pay the ransom!" (see KÃ¶nig, l.c. p315). Anadiplosis.
A special kind of rhythm was produced by the frequent employment of the so-
called anadiplosis, a mode of speech in which the phrase at the end of one
sentence is repeated at the beginning of the next, as, for instance, in the
passages "they came not to the help of the Lord to protect God's people, to the
help of the Lord against the mighty" (Judges 5:23; compare "áº“idá¸³ot" and
"nilá¸¥amu" [5:19a-20a, b), and "From whence shall my help come? My help cometh
from the Lord" (Psalm 121:1b-2a, R. V.). Many similar passages occur in fifteen
of the Psalms, 120-134, which also contain an unusual number of epanalepsis, or
catch-words, for which Israel Davidson proposed the name "LeittÃ¶ne." Thus
there is the repetition of "shakan" in Psalm 120:5, 6; of "shalom" in verses 6
and 7 of the same psalm; and the catch-word "yishmor" in Psalm 121:7, 8 (all
the cases are enumerated in KÃ¶nig, l.c. p.Â 302). As the employment of such
repetitions is somewhat suggestive of the mounting of stairs, the
superscription "shir ha-ma'alot," found at the beginning of these fifteen
psalms, may have a double meaning: it may indicate not only the purpose of
these songs, to be sung on the pilgrimages to the festivals at Jerusalem, but
also the peculiar construction of the songs, by which the reciter is led from
one step of the inner life to the next. Such graduated rhythm may be observed
elsewhere; for the peasants in modern Syria accompany their national dance by a
song the verses of which are connected like the links of a chain, each verse
beginning with the final words of the preceding one (Wetzstein, l.c. v. 292).
Acrostics. Alphabetical acrostics are used as an external embellishment of a
few poems. The letters of the alphabet, generally in their ordinary sequence,
stand at the beginning of smaller or larger sections of Psalms 9-10 (probably),
15, 34, 37, 111, 112, 119, 145; Proverbs 31:10-31; Lamentations 1-4; and also
of Sirach 51:13-29, as the newly discovered Hebrew text of this book has shown
(see, on Psalms 25 and 34 especially, Hirsch in "Am. Jour. Semit. Lang." 1902,
p167-173). Alphabetical and other acrostics occur frequently in Neo-Hebraic
poetry. The existence of acrostics in Babylonian literature has been definitely
proved; and alphabetical poems are found also among the Samaritans, Syrians,
and Arabs. Cicero says ("De Divinatione," II.54) that the verse of the sibyl
was in acrostics; and the so-called "Oracula Sibyllina" contain an acrostic. A
secondary phenomenon, which distinguishes a part of the poems of the Old
Testament from the other parts, is the so-called "accentuatio poetica"; it has
been much slighted (Sievers, l.c. Â§ 248, p.Â 375). Although not all the
poetical portions of the Old Testament are marked by a special accentuation,
the Book of Job in 3:3-42:6 and the books of Psalms and Proverbs throughout
have received unusual accents. This point will be further discussed later on.
Division of the poetical portions of the Hebrew Bible. Poems that deal with
events. First may be mentioned poems that deal principally with events, being
epic-lyric in character: the triumphal song of Israel delivered from Egypt, or
the "song of the sea"; the mocking song on the burning of Heshbon; the so-
called "song of Moses"; the song of Deborah; the derisive song of victory of
the Israelite women; Hannah's song of praise; David's song of praise on being
saved from his enemies; Hezekiah's song of praise on his recovery; Jonah's song
of praise; and many of the Psalms, e.g., those on the creation of the world,
and on the election of Israel. A subdivision is formed by poems that deal more
with description and praise: the so-called Well song; the song of praise on the
uniqueness of the God of Israel; and those on His eternity; His omnipresence
and omniscience; and His omnipotence. Didactic poems. Poems appealing more to
reason, being essentially didactic in character. These include fables, like
that of Jotham (Judges 9:7-15, although in prose); parables, like those of
Nathan and others (2 Samuel 12:1-4, 14:4-9; 1 Kings 20:39 and following, all
three in prose), or in the form of a song (Isaiah 5:1-6); riddles (Judges 14:14
and following; Proverbs 30:11 and following); maxims, as, for instance, in 1
Samuel 15:22, 24:14, and the greater part of Proverbs; the monologues and
dialogues in Job 3:3 and following; compare also the reflections in monologue
in Ecclesiastes. A number of the Psalms also are didactic in character. A
series of them impresses the fact that God's law teaches one to abhor sin
(Psalms 5, 58), and inculcates a true love for the Temple and the feasts of
Yahweh (Psalms 15, 81, 92). Another series of Psalms shows that God is just,
although it may at times seem different to a short-sighted observer of the
world and of history ("theodicies": Psalms 49, 73; compare Psalms 16, 56, 60).
Lyrics. Poems that portray feelings based on individual experience. Many of
these lyrics express joy, as, e.g., Lamech's so-called "Song of the sword";
David's "last words"; the words of praise of liberated Israel; songs of praise
like Psalms 18, 24, 126, etc. Other lyrics express mourning. First among these
are the dirges proper for the dead, as the á¸³inah on the death of Saul and
Jonathan; that on Abner's death; and all psalms of mourning, as, e.g., the
expressions of sorrow of sufferers, and the expressions of penitence of
sinners. Poems that urge action. It was natural that in the drama, which is
intended to portray a whole series of external and internal events, several of
the foregoing kinds of poems should be combined. This combination occurs in
Canticles, which, in Davidson's opinion, is most correctly characterized as a
kind of drama. The peculiar sublimity of the poems of the Old Testament is due
partly to the high development of monotheism which finds expression therein and
partly to the beauty of the moral ideals which they exalt. This subject has
been discussed by J. D. Michaelis in the preface to his Arabic grammar, second
edition, p29, and by Emil Kautzsch in "Die Poesie und die Poetischen BÃ¼cher
des A. T." (1902). Extent of Poetry in the Old Testament. How much of the
Hebrew Bible is to be considered poetry? Can the prophetic books be considered
as poetry? Setting aside the many modern exegetes of the Old Testament who have
gone so far as to discuss the meters and verse of the several prophets, it may
be noted here merely that Sievers says (l.c. p.Â 374) that the prophecies,
aside from a few exceptions to be mentioned, are "eo ipso" poetic, i.e., in
verse. But the fact must be noted, which no one has so far brought forward,
namely, that every single utterance of Balaam is called a sentence ("mashal";
Numbers 23:7, 23:18, 24:3, 24:15, 24:20, 24:23), while in the prophetic books
this term is not applied to the prophecies. There "mashal" is used only in the
Book of Ezekiel, and in an entirely different sense, namely, that of figurative
speech or allegory (Ezekiel 17:2, 21:5, 24:3). This fact seems to show that in
earlier times prophecies were uttered more often in shorter sentences, while
subsequently, in keeping with the development of Hebrew literature, they were
uttered more in detail, and the sentence was naturally amplified into the
discourse. This view is supported by Isaiah 1, the first prophecy being as
follows: "Banim giddalti we-romamti," etc. There is here certainly such a
symmetry in the single sentences that the rhythm which has been designated
above as the poetic rhythm must be ascribed to them. But in the same chapter
there occur also sentences like the following: "Aráº“ekÃ©m shemamÃ¡h 'arekÃ©m
serufot-Ã©sh; admatekÃ©m le-negdekÃ©m zarÃ­m okelÃ­m otÃ¡h" (verse 7), or this,
"When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to
tread my courts?" (verse 12). In the last pair of lines even the translation
sufficiently shows that each line does not contain three stresses merely, as
does each line of the words of God (verses 2b, 3a, b). Although the prophets of
Israel inserted poems in their prophecies, or adopted occasionally the rhythm
of the dirge, which was well known to their readers, their utterances, aside
from the exceptions to be noted, were in the freer rhythm of prose. This view
is confirmed by a sentence of Jerome that deserves attention. He says in his
preface to his translation of Isaiah: "Let no one think that the prophets among
the Hebrews were bound by meter similar to that of the Psalms."
