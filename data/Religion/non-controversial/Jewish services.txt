Jewish prayer Jewish prayer (, "tefill√°h"; plural , "tefillos" or "tefill√≥t";
Yiddish ◊™÷º◊§÷ø◊ú◊î "tf√≠le", plural ◊™÷º◊§÷ø◊ú◊ï◊™ "tf√≠lles"; Yinglish:
davening from Yiddish ◊ì◊ê÷∑◊ï◊ï◊ ◊¢◊ü "davnen" ‚Äòto pray‚Äô) are the prayer
recitations that form part of the observance of Judaism. These prayers, often
with instructions and commentary, are found in the "siddur", the traditional
Jewish prayer book. According to the Talmud, prayer is a Biblical commandment
and the Talmud gives two reasons why there are three basic prayers: to recall
the daily sacrifices at the Temple in Jerusalem, and/or because each of the
Patriarchs instituted one prayer: Abraham the morning, Isaac the afternoon and
Jacob the evening. A distinction is made between individual prayer and communal
prayer, which requires a quorum known as a "minyan", with communal prayer being
preferable as it permits the inclusion of prayers that otherwise must be
omitted. Maimonides (1135‚Äì1204 CE) relates that until the Babylonian exile
(586 BCE), all Jews composed their own prayers, but thereafter the sages of the
Great Assembly composed the main portions of the "siddur". Modern scholarship
dating from the Wissenschaft des Judentums movement of 19th century Germany, as
well as textual analysis influenced by the 20th Century discovery of the Dead
Sea Scrolls, suggests that dating from this period there existed "liturgical
formulations of a communal nature designated for particular occasions and
conducted in a centre totally independent of Jerusalem and the Temple, making
use of terminology and theological concepts that were later to become dominant
in Jewish and, in some cases, Christian prayer." The language of the prayers,
while clearly from the Second Temple period (516 BCE‚Äì70 CE), often employs
Biblical idiom. Jewish prayerbooks emerged during the early Middle Ages during
the period of the Geonim of Babylonia (6th‚Äì11th Centuries CE) Over the last
two thousand years variations have emerged among the traditional liturgical
customs of different Jewish communities, such as Ashkenazic, Sephardic,
Yemenite, Hassidic, and others, however the differences are minor compared with
the commonalities. Most of the Jewish liturgy is sung or chanted with
traditional melodies or trope. Synagogues may designate or employ a
professional or lay "hazzan" (cantor) for the purpose of leading the
congregation in prayer, especially on Shabbat or holidays. Origin and history
of Jewish prayer. Biblical origin. According to the Talmud (tractate Taanit
2a), prayer is a Biblical command: "'You shall serve God with your whole
heart.' () What service is performed with the heart? This is prayer." The
prayers are therefore referred to as "Avodah sheba-Lev" ("service that is in
the heart"). The noted rabbi Maimonides likewise categorizes prayer as a
Biblical command, but believed that the number of prayers and their times are
not. Additional Biblical references suggest that King David and the prophet
Daniel prayed three times a day. In Psalms, David states: "Evening, morning and
afternoon do I pray and cry, and He will hear my voice" (). As in Daniel: "
[...] his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon
his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he
had done before" (). Orthodox Judaism regards "halakha" (Jewish law) as
requiring Jewish men to pray three times daily and four times daily on the
Sabbath and most Jewish holidays, and five times on Yom Kippur. Orthodox Jewish
women are required to pray at least daily, with no specific time requirement,
but the system of multiple daily prayer services is regarded as optional.
Conservative Judaism also regards the "halakhic" system of multiple daily
services as mandatory. Since 2002, Conservative Jewish women have been regarded
as having undertaken a communal obligation to pray the same prayers at the same
times as men, with traditionalist communities and individual women permitted to
opt out. Reform and Reconstructionist congregations do not regard "halakha" as
binding and hence regard appropriate prayer times as matters of personal
spiritual decision rather than a matter of religious requirement. Text and
language. According to halakha, all individual prayers and virtually all
communal prayers may be said in any language that the person praying
understands. For example, the "Mishnah" mentions that the "Shema" need not be
said in Hebrew A list of prayers that must be said in Hebrew is given in the
Mishna, and among these only the Priestly Blessing is in use today, as the
others are prayers that are to be said only in a Temple in Jerusalem, by a
priest, or by a reigning King. Despite this, the tradition of most Ashkenazi
Orthodox synagogues is to use Hebrew (usually Ashkenazi Hebrew) for all except
a small number of prayers, including the "Kaddish", which had always been in
Aramaic, and sermons and instructions, for which the local language is used. In
other streams of Judaism there is considerable variability: Sephardic
communities may use Ladino or Portuguese for many prayers; Conservative
synagogues tend to use the local language to a varying degree; and at some
Reform synagogues almost the whole service may be in the local language.
Maimonides (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Prayer 1:4) relates that until the
Babylonian exile, all Jews composed their own prayers. After the exile,
however, the sages of the time (united in the Great Assembly) found the ability
of the people insufficient to continue the practice, and they composed the main
portions of the "siddur", such as the "Amidah". The origins of modern Jewish
prayer were established during the period of the Tannaim, "from their
traditions, later committed to writing, we learn that the generation of rabbis
active at the time of the destruction of the Second Temple (70 C.E.) gave
Jewish prayer its structure and, in outline form at least, its contents." This
liturgy included the twice-daily recitation of the Shema, the Amidah, or
Shmoneh Esrei, including 18 blessings recited several times daily, and the
public recitation of the Torah in installments. The oldest prayer books date
from the time of the Geonim of Babylonia; "some were composed by respected
rabbinic scholars at the request of far-flung communities seeking an
authoritative text of the required prayers for daily use, Shabbat, and
holidays." The language of the prayers, while clearly being from the Second
Temple period, often employs Biblical idiom, and according to some authorities
it should not contain rabbinic or Mishnaic idiom apart from in the sections of
Mishnah that are featured (see Baer). Over the last two thousand years, the
various streams of Jews have resulted in small variations in the traditional
liturgy customs among different Jewish communities, with each community having
a slightly different Nusach (customary liturgy). The principal difference is
between Ashkenazic and Sephardic customs, although there are other communities
(e.g. Yemenite Jews), and Hassidic and other communities also have distinct
customs, variations, and special prayers. The differences are quite minor
compared with the commonalities. The siddur. The earliest parts of Jewish
prayer are the "Shema Yisrael" ("Hear O Israel") (Deuteronomy 6:4 "et seq"),
and the Priestly Blessing (Numbers 6:24-26), which are in the Torah. A set of
eighteen (currently nineteen) blessings called the "Shemoneh Esreh" or the
"Amidah" (Hebrew, "standing "), is traditionally ascribed to the Great Assembly
in the time of Ezra, at the end of the Biblical period. The name "Shemoneh
Esreh", literally "eighteen", is an historical anachronism, since it now
contains nineteen blessings. It was only near the end of the Second Temple
period that the eighteen prayers of the weekday Amidah became standardized.
Even at that time their precise wording and order was not yet fixed, and varied
from locale to locale. Many modern scholars believe that parts of the Amidah
came from the Hebrew apocryphal work Ben Sira. According to the Talmud, soon
after the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem a formal version of the Amidah
was adopted at a rabbinical council in Yavne, under the leadership of Rabban
Gamaliel II and his colleagues. However, the precise wording was still left
open. The order, general ideas, opening and closing lines were fixed. Most of
the wording was left to the individual reader. It was not until several
centuries later that the prayers began to be formally fixed. By the Middle Ages
the texts of the prayers were nearly fixed, and in the form in which they are
still used today. The siddur was printed by Soncino in Italy as early as 1486,
though a siddur was first mass-distributed only in 1865. The siddur began
appearing in the vernacular as early as 1538. The first English translation, by
Gamaliel ben Pedahzur (a pseudonym), appeared in London in 1738; a different
translation was released in the United States in 1837. Readings from the Torah
(five books of Moses) and the Nevi'im ("Prophets") form part of the prayer
services. To this framework various Jewish sages added, from time to time,
various prayers, and, for festivals especially, numerous hymns. The earliest
existing codification of the prayerbook was drawn up by Rav Amram Gaon of Sura,
Babylon, about 850 CE. Half a century later Rav Saadia Gaon, also of Sura,
composed a siddur, in which the rubrical matter is in Arabic. These were the
basis of Simcha ben Samuel's Machzor Vitry (11th century France), which was
based on the ideas of his teacher, Rashi. Another formulation of the prayers
was that appended by Maimonides to the laws of prayer in his Mishneh Torah:
this forms the basis of the Yemenite liturgy, and has had some influence on
other rites. From this point forward all Jewish prayerbooks had the same basic
order and contents. Denominational variations. Conservative services generally
use the same basic format for services as in Orthodox Judaism with some
doctrinal leniencies and some prayers in English. In practice there is wide
variation among Conservative congregations. In traditionalist congregations the
liturgy can be almost identical to that of Orthodox Judaism, almost entirely in
Hebrew (and Aramaic), with a few minor exceptions, including excision of a
study session on Temple sacrifices, and modifications of prayers for the
restoration of the sacrificial system. In more liberal Conservative synagogues
there are greater changes to the service, with up to a third of the service in
English; abbreviation or omission of many of the preparatory prayers; and
replacement of some traditional prayers with more contemporary forms. There are
some changes for doctrinal reasons, including egalitarian language, fewer
references to restoring sacrifices in the Temple in Jerusalem, and an option to
eliminate special roles for Kohanim and Levites. The liturgies of Reform and
Reconstructionist are based on traditional elements, but contains language more
reflective of liberal belief than the traditional liturgy. Doctrinal revisions
generally include revising or omitting references to traditional doctrines such
as bodily resurrection, a personal Jewish Messiah, and other elements of
traditional Jewish eschatology, Divine revelation of the Torah at Mount Sinai,
angels, conceptions of reward and punishment, and other personal miraculous and
supernatural elements. Services are often from 40% to 90% in the vernacular.
Reform Judaism has made greater alterations to the traditional service in
accord with its more liberal theology including dropping references to
traditional elements of Jewish eschatology such as a personal Messiah, a bodily
resurrection of the dead, and others. The Hebrew portion of the service is
substantially abbreviated and modernized and modern prayers substituted for
traditional ones. In addition, in keeping with their view that the laws of
Shabbat (including a traditional prohibition on playing instruments) are
inapplicable to modern circumstances, Reform services often play instrumental
or recorded music with prayers on the Jewish Sabbath. All Reform synagogues are
Egalitarian with respect to gender roles. Philosophy of prayer. In Jewish
philosophy and in Rabbinic literature, it is noted that the Hebrew verb for
prayer‚Äî"hitpallel" ◊î◊™◊§◊ú◊ú‚Äîis in fact the reflexive form of "palal"
◊§◊ú◊ú, to judge. Thus, "to pray" conveys the notion of "judging oneself":
ultimately, the purpose of prayer‚Äî"tefilah" ◊™◊§◊ú◊î‚Äîis to transform
ourselves [http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/39928/jewish/The-
Cosmology-of-the-Mitzvot.htm. This etymology is consistent with the Jewish
conception of divine simplicity. It is not God that changes through our
prayer‚ÄîMan does not influence God as a defendant influences a human judge who
has emotions and is subject to change‚Äîrather it is man himself who is changed
It is further consistent with Maimonides' view on Divine Providence. Here,
Tefillah is the medium which God gave to man by means of which he can change
himself, and thereby establish a new "relationship" with God‚Äîand thus a new
destiny for himself in life [http://www.mesora.org/prayer.html [http://
www.ou.org/torah/weiss/5758/behaalotecha58.htm]; see also under Psalms. The
rationalist approach. In this view, ultimate goal of prayer is to help train a
person to focus on divinity through philosophy and intellectual contemplation.
This approach was taken by Maimonides and the other medieval rationalists. The
educational approach. In this view, prayer is not a conversation. Rather, it is
meant to inculcate certain attitudes in the one who prays, but not to
influence. This has been the approach of Rabbenu Bachya, Yehuda Halevy, Joseph
Albo, Samson Raphael Hirsch, and Joseph Dov Soloveitchik. This view is
expressed by Rabbi Nosson Scherman in the overview to the Artscroll Siddur
(p.¬ XIII); note that Scherman goes on to also affirm the Kabbalistic view (see
below). Kabbalistic view. Kabbalah (esoteric Jewish mysticism) uses a series of
kavanot, directions of intent, to specify the path the prayer ascends in the
dialog with God, to increase its chances of being answered favorably.
Kabbalists ascribes a higher meaning to the purpose of prayer, which is no less
than affecting the very fabric of reality itself, restructuring and repairing
the universe in a real fashion. In this view, every word of every prayer, and
indeed, even every letter of every word, has a precise meaning and a precise
effect. Prayers thus literally affect the mystical forces of the universe, and
repair the fabric of creation. This approach has been taken by the Chassidei
Ashkenaz (German pietists of the Middle-Ages), the Zohar, the Arizal's
Kabbalist tradition, the Ramchal, most of Hassidism, the Vilna Gaon and Jacob
Emden. Methodology and terminology. Terms for praying. "Daven" is the
originally exclusively Eastern Yiddish verb meaning "pray"; it is widely used
by Ashkenazic Orthodox Jews. In Yinglish, this has become the Anglicised
"davening". The origin of the word is obscure, but is thought by some to have
come from Middle French "divin" (short for "office divin", Divine service) and
by others to be derived from a Slavic word meaning "to give" (, davat') .
Others claim that it originates from an Aramaic word, "de'avoohon" or
"d'avinun", meaning "of their/our forefathers", as the three prayers are said
to have been invented by Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. In Western Yiddish, the term
for "pray" is "oren", a word with clear roots in Romance languages‚Äîcompare
Spanish and Portuguese "orar" and Latin "orare". Kevin A. Brook, cites Zeiden's
suggestion that the word 'daven' comes from Turkish root 'tabun-' meaning 'to
pray', and that in Kipchak Turkish, the initial t morphs into d. Minyan
(Quorum). Individual prayer is considered acceptable, but prayer with a quorum
of ten adults - a "minyan" - is the most highly recommended form of prayer and
is required for some prayers. An adult in this context means over the age of 13
("bar mitzvah"). Judaism had originally only counted only men in the "minyan"
for formal prayer, on the basis that one does not count someone who is not
obligated to participate. The rabbis had exempted women from almost all time-
specific positive mitzvot (commandments) due to women in the past being bound
up in an endless cycle of pregnancy, birthing and nursing from a very early
age. Orthodox Judaism still follows this reasoning and excludes women from the
minyan. Since 1973, Conservative congregations have overwhelmingly become
egalitarian and count women in the "minyan". Today quite a few Conservative
congregations even feature Female rabbis and cantors. A very small number of
congregations that identify themselves as Conservative have resisted these
changes and continue to exclude women from the minyan. Those Reform and
Reconstructionist congregations that consider a "minyan" mandatory for communal
prayer, count both men and women for a "minyan". In Orthodox Judaism, according
to some authorities, women can count in the "minyan" for certain specific
prayers, such as the "Birchot HaGomel" blessing, which both men and women are
obligated to say publicly. Various sources encourage a congregant to pray in a
fixed place in the synagogue (◊û◊ß◊ï◊ù ◊ß◊ë◊ï◊¢, "maqom qavua"). Daily prayers.
Shacharit (morning prayers). The "Shacharit" (from "shachar", morning light)
prayer is recited in the morning. "Halacha" limits parts of its recitation to
the first three (Shema) or four (Amidah) hours of the day, where "hours" are 1/
12 of daylight time, making these times dependent on the season. Various
prayers are said upon arising; the tallit katan (a garment with tzitzit) is
donned at this time. The tallit (large prayer shawl) is donned before or during
the actual prayer service, as are the tefillin (phylacteries); both are
accompanied by blessings. The service starts with the "morning blessings"
("birkot ha-shachar"), including blessings for the Torah (considered the most
important ones). In Orthodox services this is followed by a series of readings
from Biblical and rabbinic writings recalling the offerings made in the Temple
in Jerusalem. The section concludes with the "Rabbis' Kaddish" ("kaddish de-
rabbanan"). The next section of morning prayers is called "Pesukei D'Zimrah"
("verses of praise"), containing several psalms (100 and 145‚Äì150), and
prayers (such as "yehi chevod") made from a tapestry of Biblical verses,
followed by the Song at the Sea (Exodus, chapters and ). "Barechu", the formal
public call to prayer, introduces a series of expanded blessings embracing the
recitation of the "Shema". This is followed by the core of the prayer service,
the "Amidah" or "Shemoneh Esreh", a series of 19 blessings. The next part of
the service, is "Tachanun", supplications, which is omitted on days with a
festive character (and by Reform services usually entirely). On Mondays and
Thursdays a Torah reading service is inserted, and a longer version of Tachanun
takes place. Concluding prayers (see Uva letzion) and Aleinu then follow, with
the Kaddish of the mourners generally after Aleinu. Mincha (afternoon prayers).
"Mincha" or "Minha" (derived from the flour offering that accompanied each
sacrifice) may be recited from half an hour after "halachic" noontime. This
earliest time is referred to as "mincha gedola" (the "large mincha"). There is,
however, another time to daven mincha, which is then known as "mincha ketana"
(2.5 "halachic" hours before nightfall). Ideally, one should complete the
prayers before sunset, although many authorities permit reciting Mincha until
nightfall. Mincha is allowed to be recited during any of the hours between
mincha gedola and mincha ketana also. Sephardim and Italian Jews start the
Mincha prayers with Psalm 84 and "Korbanot" (), and usually continue with the
"Pittum hakketoret". The opening section is concluded with . Western Ashkenazim
recite the "Korbanot" only. "Ashrei", containing verses from Psalms , and the
entire , is recited, immediately followed by "Chatzi Kaddish" (half-Kaddish)
and the "Shemoneh Esreh" (or Amidah). This is followed by "Tachanun",
supplications, and then the full Kaddish. Sephardim insert Psalm or , followed
by the Mourner's Kaddish. After this follows, in most modern rites, the
"Aleinu". Ashkenazim then conclude with the Mourner's Kaddish. Service leaders
often wear a tallit even on normal days, and must wear one during the fast
days. Ma'ariv/Arvit (evening prayers). In many congregations, the afternoon and
evening prayers are recited back-to-back on a working day, to save people
having to attend synagogue twice. The Vilna Gaon discouraged this practice, and
followers of his set of customs commonly wait until after nightfall to recite
"Ma'ariv" (the name derives from the word "nightfall"). This service begins
with the "Barechu", the formal public call to prayer, and "Shema Yisrael"
embraced by two benedictions before and two after. Ashkenazim outside of Israel
(except Chabad-Lubavitch and followers of the Vilna Gaon) then add another
blessing ("Baruch Adonai le-Olam"), which is made from a tapestry of biblical
verses. (This prayer is also said by Baladi Temanim in and out of Israel.) This
is followed by the Half-Kaddish, and the "Shemoneh Esreh" ("Amidah"), bracketed
with the full Kaddish. Sephardim then say Psalm 121, say the Mourner's Kaddish,
and repeat "Barechu" before concluding with the Aleinu. Ashkenazim, in the
diaspora, do neither say Psalm 121 nor repeat Barechu, but conclude with
"Aleinu" followed by the Mourner's Kaddish (in Israel, Ashkenazim do repeat
Barcheu after mourner's Kaddish). Prayer on Shabbat (Sabbath). On the Sabbath,
prayers are similar in structure to those on weekdays, although almost every
part is lengthened. One exception in the "Amidah", the main prayer, which is
"abridged". The first three and last three blessings are recited as usual, but
the middle thirteen are replaced with a single blessing known as ""sanctity of
the day,"" describing the Sabbath. Atypically, this middle blessing is
different for each of the prayers. Friday night. Shabbat services begin on
Friday evening with the weekday Mincha (see above), followed in some
communities by the Song of Songs, and then in most communities by the "Kabbalat
Shabbat", the mystical prelude to Shabbat services composed by 16th century
Kabbalists. This Hebrew term literally means "Receiving the Sabbath". In many
communities, the piyut "Yedid Nefesh" introduces the Kabbalat Shabbat prayers.
Kabbalat Shabbat is, except for amongst many Italian and Spanish and Portuguese
Jews, composed of six psalms, to , and , representing the six week-days. Next
comes the poem "Lekha Dodi". Composed by Rabbi Shlomo Halevi Alkabetz in the
mid-16th century, it is based on the words of the Talmudic sage Hanina: "Come,
let us go out to meet the Queen Sabbath" (Talmud Shabbat 119a). Kabbalat
Shabbat is concluded by (the recital of which constitutes men's acceptance of
the current Shabbat with all its obligations) and . Many add a study section
here, including "Bameh Madlikin" and "Amar rabbi El'azar" and the concluding
"Kaddish deRabbanan" and is then followed by the Maariv service; other
communities delay the study session until after Maariv. Still other customs add
here a passage from the Zohar. The Shema section of the Friday night service
varies in some details from the weekday services‚Äîmainly in the different
ending of the "Hashkivenu" prayer and the omission of "Baruch Adonai le-Olam"
prayer in those traditions where this section is otherwise recited. In the
Italian rite, there are also different versions of the "Ma'ariv 'aravim" prayer
(beginning "asher killah" on Friday nights) and the "Ahavat 'olam" prayer. Most
commemorate the Shabbat at this point with "VeShameru" (). The custom to recite
the biblical passage at this point has its origins in the Lurianic Kabbalah,
and does not appear before the 16th century. It is therefore absent in
traditions and prayer books less influenced by the Kabbalah (such as the
Yemenite "Baladi" tradition), or those that opposed adding additional readings
to the siddur based upon the Kabbalah (such as the Vilna Gaon). The middle
blessing of the "Amidah" (see above) discusses the conclusion of the Creation,
quoting the relevant verses from Genesis. This is then followed by the hazzan's
mini-repetition of the Amidah, "Magen Avot", a digest of the seven
benedictions. In some Ashkenazi Orthodox synagogues the second chapter of
Mishnah tractate Shabbat, "Bameh Madlikin", is read at this point, instead of
earlier. Kiddush is recited in the synagogue in Ashkenazi and a few Sephardi
communities. The service then follows with Aleinu. Most Sephardi and many
Ashkenazi synagogues end with the singing of "Yigdal", a poetic adaptation of
Maimonides' 13 principles of Jewish faith. Other Ashkenazi synagogues end with
"Adon `olam" instead. Shacharit. Shabbat morning prayers commence as on week-
days. Of the hymns, Psalm 100 ("Mizmor LeTodah", the psalm for the Thanksgiving
offering), is omitted because the "todah" or Thanksgiving offering could not be
offered on Shabbat in the days of the Temple in Jerusalem. Its place is taken
in the Ashkenazi tradition by Psalms , , , , , , , , . Sephardic Jews maintain
a different order, add several psalms and two religious poems. The "Nishmat"
prayer is recited at the end of the "Pesukei D'Zimrah". The blessings before
"Shema" are expanded, and include the hymn "El Adon", which is often sung
communally. The intermediary benediction of the "Shacharit Amidah" begins with
"Yismach Moshe" and discusses Moses' receiving of the Torah (which according to
tradition took place on the morning of the Sabbath]]. Kedushah, which is always
recited during the Hazzan's repetition of the third blessing, is significantly
expanded. After the repetition is concluded, the Torah scroll is taken out of
the Ark in a ritual much longer than the ritual during the week, and the weekly
portion is read, followed by the "haftarah". After the Torah reading, three
prayers for the community are recited. Two prayers starting with "Yekum
Purkan", composed in Babylon in Aramaic, are similar to the subsequent "Mi
sheberakh", a blessing for the leaders and patrons of the synagogue. The
Sephardim omit much of the Yekum Purkan. Prayers are then recited (in some
communities) for the government of the country, for peace, and for the State of
Israel. After these prayers, Ashrei is repeated and the Torah scroll is
returned to the Ark in a procession through the Synagogue. Many congregations
allow children to come to the front in order to kiss the scroll as it passes.
In many Orthodox communities, the Rabbi (or a learned member of the
congregation) delivers a sermon at this point, usually on the topic of the
Torah reading. Mussaf. The "Musaf" service starts with the silent recitation of
the "Amidah". The middle blessing includes the "Tikanta Shabbat" reading on the
holiness of Shabbat, and then by a reading from the biblical Book of Numbers
about the sacrifices that used to be performed in the Temple in Jerusalem. Next
comes "Yismechu", "They shall rejoice in Your sovereignty", and "Eloheynu",
"Our God and God of our Ancestors, may you be pleased with our rest" (which is
recited during all "Amidah"s of the Sabbath. Kedushah is greatly expanded.
After the "Amidah" comes the full Kaddish, followed by "Ein keloheinu". In
Orthodox Judaism this is followed by a reading from the Talmud on the incense
offering called Pittum Haketoreth and daily psalms that used to be recited in
the Temple in Jerusalem. These readings are usually omitted by Conservative
Jews, and are always omitted by Reform Jews. The "Musaf" service culminates
with the Rabbi's Kaddish, the "Aleinu", and then the Mourner's Kaddish. Some
synagogues conclude with the reading of "An'im Zemirot", "The Hymn of Glory",
Mourner's Kaddish, The psalm of the Day and either Adon Olam or Yigdal. Mincha.
Mincha commences with "Ashrei" (see above) and the prayer Uva letzion, after
which the first section of the next weekly portion is read from the Torah
scroll. The "Amidah" follows the same pattern as the other Shabbat "Amidah"
prayers, with the middle blessing starting "Attah Echad". Ma'ariv. The week-day
Ma'ariv is recited on the evening immediately following Shabbat, concluding
with "Vihi No'am", "Ve-Yitten lekha", and "Havdalah". Special observances and
circumstances. Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur. The services for the Days of
Awe‚ÄîRosh Hashana and Yom Kippur‚Äîtake on a solemn tone as befits these days.
Traditional solemn tunes are used in the prayers. The musaf service on Rosh
Hashana has nine blessings; the three middle blessings include biblical verses
attesting to sovereignty, remembrance and the shofar, which is sounded 100
times during the service. Yom Kippur is the only day in the year when there are
five prayer services. The evening service, containing the Ma'ariv prayer, is
widely known as "Kol Nidrei", the opening declaration made preceding the
prayer. During the daytime, shacharit, musaf (which is recited on Shabbat and
all festivals) and mincha are followed, as the sun begins to set, by Ne'ila,
which is recited just this once a year. Pesach, Shavuot and Sukkot. The
services for the three festivals of Pesach ("Passover"), Shavuot ("Feast of
Weeks" or "Pentecost"), and Sukkot ("Feast of Tabernacles") are alike, except
for interpolated references and readings for each individual festival. The
preliminaries and conclusions of the prayers are the same as on Shabbat. The
Amidah on these festivals only contains seven benedictions, with "Attah
Bechartanu" as the main one. Hallel (communal recitation of Psalms -) follows.
The Musaf service includes Umi-Penei Hata'enu, with reference to the special
festival and Temple sacrifices on the occasion. A blessing on the pulpit
("dukhen") is pronounced by the "kohanim" (Jewish priests) during the Amidah
(this occurs daily in Israel and most Sephardic congregations, but only on
Pesach, Shavuot, Sukkot, Rosh Hashanah, and Yom Kippur in Ashkenazic
congregations of the diaspora). On week-days and Sabbath the priestly blessing
is recited by the hazzan after the Modim ("Thanksgiving") prayer. (American
Reform Jews omit the Musaf service.) Missed prayer. In the event one of the
prayers was missed inadvertedly, the Amidah prayer is said twice in the next
service ‚Äî a procedure known as "tefillat tashlumin". Related customs. Many
Jews sway their body back and forth during prayer. This practice (referred to
as "shoklen" in Yiddish) is not mandatory, and in fact the kabbalist Isaac
Luria felt that it should not be done. In contrast, the German Medieval
authority "Maharil" (Rabbi Jacob Molin) linked the practice to a statement in
the Talmud that the Mishnaic sage Rabbi Akiva would sway so forcefully that he
ended up at the other side of the room when praying (Talmud tractate Berachot).
Many are accustomed to giving charity before, during (especially during
Vayivarech David) or after prayer, in the hopes that this will make their
prayer more likely to be heard. Role of women. Men are obligated to perform
public prayer three times a day with additional services on Jewish holidays.
According to Jewish law, each prayer must be performed within specific time
ranges, based on the time that the communal sacrifice the prayer is named after
would have been performed in the days of the Temple in Jerusalem. According to
the Talmud women are generally exempted from obligations that have to be
performed at a certain time. Orthodox authorities have generally interpreted
this exemption due to women's higher spiritual level and therefore a lack of
need to connect to God at specific times, since they are always connected to
God. In accordance with the general exemption from time-bound obligations, most
Orthodox authorities have exempted women from performing evening prayers
(Maariv), but most believe that women should at least try to pray Shacharit and
Mincha, the morning and afternoon prayers, respectively. Orthodox authorities
have been careful to note that although women have been exempted from praying
at specific fixed times, they are not exempted from the obligation of prayer
itself. The 19th century posek Yechiel Michel Epstein, author of the "Arukh
HaShulkhan", notes: "Even though the rabbis set prayer at fixed times in fixed
language, it was not their intention to issue a leniency and exempt women from
this ritual act". Authorities have disagreed on the minimum amount that women's
prayer should contain. Many Jews rely on the ruling of the (Ashkenazi) Rabbi
Avraham Gombiner in his "Magen Avraham" commentary on the "Shulkhan Arukh", and
more recently the (Sephardi) Rabbi Ovadia Yosef ("Yabiah Omer" vol. 6, 17),
that women are only required to pray once a day, in any form they choose, so
long as the prayer contains praise of (brakhot), requests to (bakashot), and
thanks of (hodot) God. In addition, not all Orthodox authorities agree that
women are completely exempt from time-bound prayer. The "Mishnah Berurah" by
Rabbi Yisrael Meir Kagan, an important code of Ashkenzic Jewish law, holds that
the Men of the Great Assembly obligated women to say "Shacharit" (morning) and
"Minchah" (afternoon) prayer services each day, "just like men". The "Mishnah
Berurah" also states that although women are exempt from reciting the Shema
Yisrael, they should nevertheless say it anyway. Nonetheless, even the most
liberal Orthodox authorities hold that women cannot count in a minyan for
purposes of public prayer. Throughout Orthodox Judaism, including its most
liberal forms, men and women are required to sit in separate sections with a
mechitza (partition) separating them. Conservative/Masorti Judaism permits
mixed seating (almost universally in the United States, but not in all
countries). All Reform and Reconstructionist congregations have mixed seating.
Haredi and much of Modern Orthodox Judaism has a blanket prohibition on women
leading public congregational prayers. Conservative Judaism has developed a
blanket justification for women leading all or virtually all such prayers,
holding that although only obligated individuals can lead prayers and women
were not traditionally obligated, Conservative Jewish women in modern times
have as a collective whole voluntarily undertaken such an obligation. Reform
and Reconstructionist congregations permit women to perform all prayer roles
because they do not regard halakha as binding. A small liberal wing within
Modern Orthodox Judaism, particularly rabbis friendly to the Jewish Orthodox
Feminist Alliance (JOFA), has begun re-examining the role of women in prayers
based on an individual, case-by-case look at the historical role of specific
prayers and services, doing so within classical "halakhic" interpretation. A
very small number of Modern Orthodox congregations accept some such arguments,
but very few Orthodox congregations or authorities accept all or even most of
them. Many of those who do not accept this reasoning point to "kol isha", the
tradition that prohibits a man from hearing a woman other than his wife sing.
JOFA refers to congregations generally accepting such arguments as Partnership
Minyanim. On Shabbat in a Partnership Minyan, women can typically lead
"Kabbalat Shabbat", the "P'seukei D'Zimrah", the services for removing the
Torah from and replacing it to the Ark, and Torah reading, as well as give a
"D'Var Torah" or sermon. Role of minors. In most divisions of Judaism boys
prior to Bar Mitzvah cannot act as a Chazzen for prayer services that contain
"devarim sheb'kidusha", i.e. Kaddish, Barechu, the amida, etc., or receive an
aliya or chant the Torah for the congregation. Since Kabbalat Shabbat is just
psalms and does not contain "devarim sheb'kidusha", it is possible for a boy
under Bar Mitzvah to lead until Barechu of Ma'ariv. Some eastern Jews let a boy
under bar mitzvah read the Torah and have an aliyah.
