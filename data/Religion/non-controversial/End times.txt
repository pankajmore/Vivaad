End time The end time (also called end times, end of days, last days or
eschaton) is a time period described in the eschatological writings in the
Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity, Baha'i and Islam) and in doomsday
scenarios in Hinduism, Buddhism and various other non-Abrahamic religions. In
Judaism the term "end of days" is a reference to the Messianic Age and the
Jewish belief in the coming of "mashiach" and the "Olam haba", that will usher
in peace and unity for all mankind, in the service of one God. In Islam, "Yawm
al-QiyƒÅmah" "the Day of Resurrection" or "Yawm ad-Din" "the Day of Judgement",
Allah's final assessment of humanity, is preceded by the end of the world. In
Christianity, the end times are often depicted as a time of tribulation that
precedes the Second Coming of the messiah, Jesus, who will usher in the Kingdom
of God and bring an end to suffering and evil and all things wrong with the
current world which is tainted by original sin. Various other religions also
have eschatological beliefs associated with turning and redemption. Since the
advent of modern science in the 18th century, the discovery of deep time, and
the age of the Earth, the concept of an end of days has been replaced in
contemporary discourse with questions about the ultimate fate of the universe.
Most scientists believe that the "end of the world" will finally occur hundreds
of billions of years from now with the heat death of the universe. Linear
cosmology. Zoroastrianism. Zoroastrian eschatology is the oldest eschatology
found in recorded history. By the year 500 BC, a fully developed concept of the
end of the world was established in Zoroastrianism. According to Zoroastrian
philosophy, redacted in the Zand-i Vohuman Yasht, "at the end of thy tenth
hundredth winter...the sun is more unseen and more spotted; the year, month,
and day are shorter; and the earth is more barren; and the crop will not yield
the seed; and men ... become more deceitful and more given to vile practices.
They have no gratitude." "Honorable wealth will all proceed to those of
perverted faith...and a dark cloud makes the whole sky night...and it will rain
more noxious creatures than winter." At the end of this spiritual battle
between the righteous and wicked, a final judgment of all souls will occur.
Sinners whose bad deeds are more than their good deeds will be punished for 3
days, but will eventually be forgiven. The world will reach perfection as all
evil traits such as poverty, old age, disease, thirst, hunger, and death will
disappear from the earth. Zoroastrian concepts parallel greatly with those of
Jewish, Christian, and Islamic eschatological beliefs. Zoroaster also preached
that bliss will be everywhere, and not just in a remote kingdom of paradise.
Judaism. In Judaism, the end times are usually called "the End of Days"
("a·∏•arit ha-yamim", ◊ê◊ó◊®◊ô◊™ ◊î◊ô◊û◊ô◊ù), a phrase that appears several
times in the Tanakh. The idea of a Messianic Age has a prominent place in
Jewish thought. It is an event with a predetermined date (which is unknown),
but can come earlier through religious observance and good deeds. Tanakh. These
events create a new order in which God is universally recognized as the ruler
over his creation, which includes everyone and everything. Messianic Age.
According to Jewish tradition, the Messianic Age will be one of global peace
and harmony, an era free of strife and hardship, and one conducive to the
furtherment of the knowledge of the creator. The theme of the messiah ushering
in an era of global peace is encapsulated in one of the most famous scriptural
passages from the Book of Isaiah, "They shall beat their swords into plowshares
and their spears into pruning hooks; nation will not lift sword against nation
and they will no longer study warfare". According to the Talmud, the Midrash,
and the medieval kabbalistic work, the Zohar, the messiah must arrive before
the year 6000 from the time of creation, or before the year 2240 CE. The
Midrash comments, "Six eons for going in and coming out, for war and peace. The
seventh eon is entirely Shabbat and rest for life everlasting". There is a
kabbalistic tradition that maintains that the 7 days of the week, which are
based upon the seven days of creation, correspond to the seven millennia of
creation. The tradition teaches that the seventh day of the week, the Shabbat
day of rest, corresponds to the seventh millennium, the age of universal 'rest'
- the Messianic Era. The seventh millennium begins with the year 6000 AM, and
is the latest time the Messiah can come. Supporting and elaborating on this
theme are numerous early and late Jewish scholars, including the Ramban, Isaac
Abrabanel, Abraham Ibn Ezra, Rabbeinu Bachya, the Vilna Gaon, the Lubavitcher
Rebbe, the Ramchal, Aryeh Kaplan and Rebbetzin Esther Jungreis. Christianity.
Some Christians in the first century believed that Jesus would return during
their lifetime, because Jesus had said to his followers to be alert or be ready
at all times. From this belief came the first evidence of the doctrine of
imminence. When the converts of Paul in Thessalonica were persecuted by the
Roman Empire, they believed the end was upon them. The prophetic theme of the
New Testament also mirrors the Old Testament, namely, Tribulation. In the New
Testament, Jesus refers to this as the "Great Tribulation", "Affliction", and
"days of vengeance." Matthew 24:15-22 (King James Version): "When ye therefore
shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand
in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand). Then let them which be
in Judaea flee into the mountains. Let him which is on the housetop not come
down to take any thing out of his house. Neither let him which is in the field
return back to take his clothes. And woe unto them that are with child, and to
them that give suck in those days! But pray ye that your flight be not in the
winter, neither on the sabbath day. For then shall be great tribulation, such
as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall
be. And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved:
but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened. Mark 13:14-20 (King
James Version): "But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of
by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth
understand,) then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains: And let him
that is on the housetop not go down into the house, neither enter therein, to
take any thing out of his house: And let him that is in the field not turn back
again for to take up his garment. But woe to them that are with child, and to
them that give suck in those days! And pray ye that your flight be not in the
winter. For in those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the
beginning of the creation which God created unto this time, neither shall be.
And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should be saved:
but for the elect's sake, whom he hath chosen, he hath shortened the days. Luke
21:20-33 (King James Version): "And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with
armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh. Then let them which are
in Judaea flee to the mountains; and let them which are in the midst of it
depart out; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto. For
these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be
fulfilled. But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck,
in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath upon
this people. And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led
away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the
Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled. And there shall be
signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth
distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring; Men's
hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are
coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken. And then shall
they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. And when
these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for
your redemption draweth nigh. And he spoke to them a parable; Behold the fig
tree, and all the trees; When they now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own
selves that summer is now nigh at hand. So likewise ye, when ye see these
things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand. Verily I
say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, till all be fulfilled.
Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away."
Catholicism. "But of that day and hour no one knows, neither the angels of
heaven, nor the Son, but the Father alone." (NAB translation) While some who
believe in the literal interpretation of the Bible insist that the prediction
of dates or times is futile, some other writers believe that Jesus foretold of
signs which would indicate that the "end of days" was near. Some of these signs
include earthquakes, natural disasters, civil problems, "wars and rumors of
wars," and other catastrophes. Of the precise time, however, it will come like
a "thief in the night" (1 Thess. 5:2). According to the Catechism of the
Catholic Church, the Catholic beliefs concerning the "End Times" are addressed
in the Profession of Faith. Protestantism. Millennialists concentrate on the
issue of whether the true believers will see the tribulation or be removed from
it by what is referred to as a Pre-Tribulation Rapture. Amillennialists believe
that the end times encompass the time from Christ's ascension to the Last day,
and maintain that the mention of the "thousand years" in the Book of Revelation
is meant to be taken metaphorically (i.e., not literally, or 'spiritually'), a
view which continues to cause divisions within evangelical Christianity. End-
times beliefs in Protestant Christianity vary widely. Christians
premillennialists who believe that the End Times are occurring now, are usually
specific about timelines that climax in the end of the world. For some, Israel,
the European Union, or the United Nations are seen as major players whose roles
are foretold in scriptures. Among dispensational premillennialists writers,
there are those who believe that Christians will be supernaturally summoned to
Heaven by Jesus in an event called the Rapture, which occurs before the
biblical "Great Tribulation" prophesied in Matthew 24-25; Mark 13 and Luke 21.
The Great Tribulation is also mentioned in the last book of the Bible¬ ‚Äî the
book of Revelation. 'End times' may also refer simply to the passing of a
particular age or long period in the relationship between man and God.
Adherents to this view sometimes cite St. Paul's second letter to Timothy, and
draw analogies to the late 20th/early 21st centuries. Post-Exilic Hebrew books
of prophecy such as the Book of Daniel and Book of Ezekiel are given new
interpretations in this Christian tradition, while apocalyptic forecasts appear
in the Judeo-Christian Sibylline Oracles and in the whole field of apocalyptic
literature, which includes the Book of Revelation ascribed to John, the
apocryphal Apocalypse of Peter, and the Second Book Of Esdras. Most
fundamentalist Christians anticipate that the biblical prophecy will be
fulfilled literally. They see current world and regional wars, earthquakes,
hurricanes and famines as the beginning of the birth pains which Jesus
described in Matthew and Mark . They believe that mankind started in the garden
of Eden, and point to Megiddo as the place that the current world system will
finish, with the Advent of Messiah coming to rule for 1,000 years. Contemporary
use of the term "End Times" has evolved from use around a group of literal
beliefs in Christian millennialism. These beliefs typically include the ideas
that the Biblical apocalypse is imminent and that various signs in current
events are omens of a climax to world history known as the battle of
Armageddon. These beliefs have been widely held in one form, by the Adventist
movement (Millerites), by Jehovah's Witnesses, and in another form by
dispensational premillennialists. In 1918 a group of eight well known preachers
produced a London Manifesto warning of an imminent second coming of Christ
shortly after the 1917 liberation of Jerusalem by the British. Religious
movements which expect that the second coming of Christ, will be a cataclysmic
event, generally called "adventism", have arisen throughout the Christian era;
but they became particularly common during and after the Protestant
Reformation. Shakers, Emanuel Swedenborg (who considered the second coming to
be symbolic, and to have occurred in 1757), and others developed entire
religious systems around a central concern for the second coming of Christ,
disclosed by new prophecy or special gifts of revelation. The Millerites are
diverse religious groups which similarly rely upon a special gift of
interpretation for fixing the date of Christ's return. The chief difference
between the 19th century Millerite and Adventist movements and contemporary
prophecy belief is that William Miller and his followers fixed the time for the
Second Coming by calendar calculations based on interpretations of the Biblical
apocalypses; they originally set a date for the Second Coming in 1844. These
sorts of computations also appear in some contemporary prophecy beliefs, but
few contemporary End Times prophets use them to fix a date; their timetables
will be triggered by future wars and moral catastrophes, and accordingly
believe that God's judgment against the conflict-ridden and corrupt world is
close at hand. Seventh-day Adventists believe that Biblical prophecy foretells
an end time scenario in which the United States works in conjunction with the
Catholic Church to mandate worship on a day other than seventh-day Sabbath
(Saturday) as prescribed in the Ten Commandments (Exodus 20:8-11), thereby
bringing about a situation where one must choose for or against the Bible as
the revealed will of God. Preterism. Another view of the 'end times' known as
"preterism" differentiates between the concept of 'time of the end' and 'end of
time', and promotes a different understanding of these prophecies, in that they
took place in the 1st century, more specifically in year AD 70, when the Jewish
Temple was destroyed, and animal sacrifices were stopped. In this view, the
'time of the end' concept is referring to the end of the covenant between God
and Israel, rather than the end of time, or the end of planet Earth. Unlike all
the other Christian theological systems, preterism holds an exclusive and
unique view on the nature and timing of the 'End Times', in that preterists
teach the 'end times' to be in the 1st century AD. Preterists believe that
prophecies such as the Second Coming, the defiling of the Temple, the
destruction of Jerusalem, the Antichrist, the Great Tribulation, the advent of
The Day of the Lord and the Final Judgment were fulfilled at or about the year
AD 70 when the Roman general (and future Emperor) Titus sacked Jerusalem and
destroyed the Jewish Temple, putting a permanent stop to the daily animal
sacrifices. Proponents of full preterism do not believe in the bodily
resurrection of the dead and place this event as well as the Second Coming in
AD 70, whereas proponents of "partial preterism" do believe in a bodily
resurrection of the dead at a future Second Coming. Full preterists contend
that those who consider themselves to be partial preterists are actually just
futurists since they believe the Second Coming, Resurrection, Rapture and
Judgment are still in the future. Many preterists believe the 1st-century
living Christians were literally raptured off the earth to be with Christ. At
that time, their bodies were changed to be like Christ's. Preterists also
believe the term 'Last Days' or 'Time of the End' refers not to the last days
of planet Earth, or last days of mankind, but to the last days of the Old
Covenant, the Mosaic Covenant which God had exclusively with Israel until year
AD 70. According to preterism, many 'time passages' in the New Testament
indicate with apparent certainty that the Second Coming of Christ, and the 'End
Times' predicted in the Bible were to take place within the lifetimes of
Christ's disciples: Matt. 10:23, Matt. 16:28, Matt. 24:34, Matt. 26:64, Rom.
13:11-12, 1 Cor. 7:29-31, 1 Cor. 10:11, Phil. 4:5, James 5:8-9, 1 Pet. 4:7, 1
Jn. 2:18. Dispensationalist prophecies. The reestablishment of Israel in 1948
provided a major impetus to the dispensationalist belief system. Israel's
history of wars after 1948 with its Arab neighbors provided further research as
was seen in at least one book by John F. Walvoord. After the Six Day War in
1967, and the Yom Kippur War in 1973, it seemed plausible to many
Fundamentalist Christians in the 1970s that Middle East turmoil may well be
leading up to the fulfillment of various Bible prophecies and to the Battle of
Armageddon. Members of the dispensationalist movement such as Hal Lindsey, J.
Dwight Pentecost, John Walvoord, all of whom have Dallas Theological Seminary
backgrounds, and some other writers, claimed further that the European Economic
Community founded on the Treaty of Rome was a revived Roman Empire, and would
become the kingdom of the coming Antichrist and the Beast. The Roman Empire
also figured into the New Testament writers' vision of the future. The fact
that in the early 1970s, there were (erroneously thought to be) seven nations
in the European Economic Community was held to be significant; this aligned the
Community with a seven-headed beast mentioned in Revelation. This specific
prophecy has required revision, but the idea of a revived Roman Empire remains.
The separate destinies of the Church and Israel, a belief which is inherent in
dispensationalism is a particular concern to some Jews and to some evangelical
Christians. Evangelicals who reject dispensationalism, such as those who hold
to a Post Tribulation Rapture, (or more accurately a Post Tribulation
Resurrection-Rapture), see both the Church and Israel entering the crucible of
the End Time together. Dispensationalism, in contrast to the Millerite
Adventist movement, had its beginning in the 19th century, when John Nelson
Darby, founder of the Plymouth Brethren religious denomination, incorporated
into his system of Biblical interpretation a system of organizing Biblical time
into a number of discrete dispensations, each of which marks a separate
covenant with God. Darby's beliefs were widely publicized in Cyrus I.
Scofield's "Scofield Reference Bible", an annotated Bible that became popular
in the United States of America. Since the majority of the Biblical prophets
were writing at a time when was mostly Jewish, and the Temple in Jerusalem was
still functioning, they wrote as if those institutions would still be in
operation during the prophesied events. According to preterism this was the
very fulfillment of the prophecies. However, according to Futurists their
destruction in AD 70 put the prophetic timetable, if there is one, on hold.
Many such believers therefore anticipated the return of Jews to Israel and the
reconstruction of the Temple before the Second Coming could occur. (See
Christian Zionism) Post-tribulation pre-millennialists. A view of the Second
Coming of Christ as held by post-tribulational pre-millennialists is unique,
though not widely held in the Protestant Church because of its connotations, in
particular that the Church of Christ will have to undergo great persecution.
Restorationism (Christian primitivism). End times theology is also significant
to restorationist Christian religions, which consider themselves distinct from
both Catholicism and Protestantism. Jehovah's Witnesses. The eschatology of
Jehovah's Witnesses is central to their religious beliefs. They believe that
Jesus Christ has been ruling in heaven as king since 1914 (a date they believe
was prophesied in Scripture), and that after that time a period of cleansing
occurred, resulting in God's selection of the Bible Students associated with
Charles Taze Russell to be his people in 1919. They also believe the
destruction of those who reject their message and thus willfully refuse to obey
God will shortly take place at Armageddon, ensuring that the beginning of the
new earthly society will be composed of willing subjects of that kingdom. The
religion's doctrines surrounding 1914 are the legacy of a series of emphatic
claims regarding the years 1799, 1874, 1878, 1914, 1918 and 1925 made in the
Watch Tower Society's publications between 1879 and 1924. Claims about the
significance of those years, including the presence of Jesus Christ, the
beginning of the "last days", the destruction of worldly governments and the
earthly resurrection of Jewish patriarchs, were successively abandoned. In 1922
the society's principal journal, "The Watchtower", described its chronology as
"no stronger than its weakest link", but also claimed the chronological
relationships to be "of divine origin and divinely corroborated...in a class by
itself, absolutely and unqualifiedly correct" and "indisputable facts", while
repudiation of Russell's teachings was described as "equivalent to a
repudiation of the Lord". The Watch Tower Society has admitted its early
leaders promoted "incomplete, even inaccurate concepts". The Governing Body of
Jehovah's Witnesses says that, unlike Old Testament prophets, its
interpretations of the Bible are not inspired or infallible. Witness
publications say that Bible prophecies can be fully understood only after their
fulfillment, citing examples of biblical figures who did not understand the
meaning of prophecies they received. Watch Tower publications often cite
Proverbs 4:18, "The path of the righteous ones is like the bright light that is
getting lighter and lighter until the day is firmly established" (NWT) to
support their view that there would be an increase in knowledge during "the
time of the end", as mentioned in Daniel 12:4. Jehovah's Witnesses state that
this increase in knowledge needs adjustments. Watch Tower publications also say
that unfulfilled expectations are partly due to eagerness for God's Kingdom and
that they do not call their core beliefs into question. The Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints. Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-
day Saints believe that there will be a Second Coming of Jesus to the earth
sometime in the future. The LDS Church and its leaders do not make any
predictions of the actual date of the Second Coming. According to LDS Church
teachings, the true gospel will be taught in all parts of the world prior to
the Second Coming. It is also believed that there will be increasingly severe
wars, earthquakes, hurricanes, and other man-made and natural disasters prior
to the Second Coming. Islam. There are various signs (as many as up to 100)
given in the Sunnah and Quran for the coming of Judgment Day. These signs can
be divided into two parts, minor and major. The major signs include Islamic
eschatology is concerned with the "Qiyamah" (end of the world; Last Judgment)
and the final judgment of humanity. Eschatology relates to one of the six
articles of faith ("aqidah") of Islam. Like the other Abrahamic religions,
Islam teaches the bodily resurrection of the dead, the fulfillment of a divine
plan for creation, and the immortality of the human soul; the righteous are
rewarded with the pleasures of "Jannah" (Heaven), while the unrighteous are
punished in "Jahannam" (Hell). A significant fraction of the Quran deals with
these beliefs, with many "hadith" elaborating on the themes and details.
Islamic apocalyptic literature describing the Armageddon is often known as
"fitna" (a test) and "malahim" (or "ghayba" in the shi'ite tradition). Cyclic
cosmology. Greek religion. Ancient Greek mythology claimed that Zeus, as he had
previously overthrown his father, Cronus, would in turn also be overthrown by a
son. This story can be seen as the equivalent to the end of the world, or the
end of an age. Prometheus revealed to him that this son would be born from Zeus
and Thetis, if they copulated. In order to prevent this from happening, Zeus
married Thetis to Peleus, a mortal hero. This union produced Achilles, the
protagonist of the Iliad and one of the greatest heroes of Greek myth. Norse
religion. In Norse mythology, Ragnar√∂k (Old Norse "Final destiny of the gods"
- c.f. "Ragn-": power, "-a-": via, "-r√∂k": rest of volition) refers to a
series of major events, including a great battle foretold to ultimately result
in the death of a number of major figures (including the gods Odin, Thor,
Freyr, Heimdall, and the j√∂tunn Loki), the occurrence of various natural
disasters, and the subsequent submersion of the world in water. Afterwards, the
world resurfaces anew and fertile, the surviving gods meet, and the world is
repopulated by two human survivors. Ragnar√∂k is an important event in the
Norse canon, and has been the subject of an amount of scholarly discourse and
theory. Hinduism. In Hinduism, time is cyclic, consisting of cycles or "Kalpa",
repeating infinitely. The "End Time" as we understand from other religions does
not exists as such. However, Kalpa (and its sub cycles) has its own start and
end. One Kalpa lasts 8.64 billion years, illustrates the pattern of decline in
the state of nature and civilization between periods of timelessness when
Brahma (Matter,mass) regenerates the world of existence/reality. Brahma has a
lifespan of 311 Trillion, 40 Billion Years, then the universe will contract to
a singularity and again will be evolved from the singularity. As Hindus do not
consider humans as special or noble creations of god, unlike some other
religions, the wrong doings or such things committed by humans shall have no
effects on the end of time, as the end of time as per Hinduism is purely a
property of matter. There are four yugs, or ages, in this process from complete
purity to complete impurity. The final is Kali Yuga, or the Dark Age, where
civilization becomes spiritually degraded, human lives are shortened by
violence and disease, and there is a general state of decay in nature. This is
the worst period before complete destruction which is then followed by a Golden
Age. "Yadaa Yadaa hi Dharmasya Glaanir bhavati Bhaarata, Abhyuthaanam
Adharmasya Tadaatmaanam Srjaamy Aham". Bhagavad Gita (Chapter IV-7) "Whenever
there is decay of righteousness O! Bharatha And a rise of unrighteousness then
I manifest Myself!" Thus whenever there is intolerable evil and chaos in the
world, there is an appearance of an Avatar. In the current yuga, known as the
Kali (the most evil) yuga, "The Lord shall manifest Himself as the "Kalki
Avatar"‚Ä¶ He will establish righteousness upon the earth and the minds of the
people will become as pure as crystal." In Hinduism, there is no eternal
damnation of souls or end times. After this evil Kali yuga ends, the next yuga
or epoch would be Satya yuga where everyone will be righteous, followed by
Treta yuga,Dwapara yuga and then another Kali Yuga. Thus time is cyclical and
the epochs keep repeating infinitely. However, the extent of tolerable evil and
degradation in each epoch is different and therefore the threshold that is
necessary for the manifestation of God's incarnation is different for each
yuga. The current yuga is the most evil and so the threshold for the appearance
of the Avatar is so high that the world needs to degrade to the maximum levels.
Brahma Kumari. Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi states the Brahma Kumaris' prediction of
the imminent end of the world, or Destruction as it is called, is generally
hidden from non-members. Before destruction everyone on earth must come to know
their God and purify themselves. Much of the Earth's land mass is also
predicted to become submerged beneath the oceans of the world and the
government of India will hand over power to them. Buddhism. Gautama Buddha
predicted that his teachings Dharma would disappear after 5,000 years, when no
one practices the actual teachings any more. According to the Sutta Pitaka, the
"ten wholesome courses of conduct" will disappear and people will follow the
ten unwholesome concepts of theft, violence, murder, lying, false speech,
sexual misconduct, abusive and idle talk, covetousness and ill will, wanton
greed, and uncontrolled lust resulting in poverty and the breakdown of law and
cooperation or regard for the dharma. As part of Buddhist eschatology, it is
believed that the age leading up to the coming of the next Buddha Maitreya will
be characterized by impiety, physical weakness, sexual depravity, and general
social disarray. Commentators like Buddhaghosa predicted a step-by-step
disappearance of the Buddha's teachings. During the first stage, arahants would
no longer appear in the world. Later, the content of the Buddha's true
teachings would vanish, and only their appearance or outward form would be
preserved. Finally, even the form of the Dharma would be lost. During the final
stage, the memory of the Buddha himself would be forgotten, and the last of his
relics would be gathered together in Bodh Gaya and cremated. Some time
following this devolution a new Buddha named Maitreya will arise to rediscover
and reveal the timeless teachings of dharma and rediscover the path to Nirvana.
Maitreya is said to currently reside in the Tushita world, before his final
rebirth in the human world. The decline of Buddha's teaching in the human
world, and its eventual re-establishment by Maitreya, are in keeping with the
general shape of Buddhist cosmology. Like Hindus, Buddhists generally believe
in cycles of destruction and creation, of which the current epoch represents
only the latest step. The historical Buddha Shakyamuni is only the latest in a
series of Buddhas that stretches back into the past. Fulfillment. While most
religious traditions remain waiting for end time events, some believe that the
events have been fulfilled. Several established religions believe that their
founder represents the coming of the Promised One of previous scriptures, and
that the spread of their teachings will ultimately bring about the desired
society of unity and justice. Bah√°'√≠ Faith. The founder of the Bah√°'√≠
Faith, Bah√°'u'll√°h claimed that he was the return of Christ as well as
prophetic expectations of other religions. The inception of the Bah√°'√≠ Faith
coincides with Millerite prophesy pointing to the year 1844. With respect to
particular expectations of the end times, it has been argued that the Battle of
Armageddon has already passed and that mass martyrdoms anticipated during the
"End Times" had already passed within the historical context of the Bah√°'√≠
Faith. Baha'is believe that these 'mass martyrdoms' refer to 20,000 members of
their predecessor religion, the Babis. However, only about 2,000 Babi deaths
can be verified from all existing sources, and it is highly unlikely that there
were ever as many as 20,000 Babis in all. Bah√°'√≠s expect their faith to be
eventually embraced by the masses of the world, ushering in a golden age of
society. Ahmadiyya. In Ahmadiyya, the present age has been a witness to the
evil of mankind and the wrath of God with the occurrence of the two great World
Wars and the frequency of natural disasters. In Ahmadiyya, (considered separate
from mainstream Islam) Ghulam Ahmad (d. 1908) is seen as the promised Messiah
and the Mahdi fulfilling Islamic and Biblical prophecies, aswell as scriptures
of other religions such as Hinduism. His teachings will establish spiritual
reform and ultimately establish an age of peace upon earth. This age continues
for around a thousand years as per Judeo-Christian prophecies; and is
characterised by the assembling of mankind under one faith as per Ahmadiyya
belief . Rastafari movement. Rastafarians have a unique interpretation of the
end times, based on the Old Testament and the Book of Revelation. They believe
Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie is God incarnate, the "King of kings" and
"Lord of lords" mentioned in Revelation 5:5. While on the one hand Selassie's
crowning was seen as the second coming, and events such as the Second Italo-
Ethiopian War were seen as fulfillments of biblical and specifically Revelation
prophecy there is also expectation that Selassie will call a day of judgment,
when he will bring home the lost children of Israel (the black peoples taken
out of Africa during the slave trade) to live with him in peace, love and
harmony in the Mount Zion in Africa.
