Priest A priest or priestess is a person authorized to perform the sacred
rituals of a religion, especially as a mediatory agent between humans and one
or multiple deities. They also have the authority or power to administer
religious rites; in particular, rites of sacrifice to, and propitiation of, a
deity or deities. Their office or position is the priesthood, a term which also
may apply to such persons collectively. Priests and priestesses have existed
since the earliest of times and in the simplest societies. They exist in all or
some branches of Judaism, Christianity, Shintoism, Hinduism and many other
religions. They are generally regarded as having positive contact with the
deity or deities of the religion to which they subscribe, often interpreting
the meaning of events and performing the rituals of the religion. Priests are
leaders to whom other believers will often turn for advice on spiritual
matters. In many religions, being a priest or priestess is a full-time
position, ruling out any other career. In other cases it is a part-time role.
For example in the early history of Iceland the chieftains were titled "go√∞i",
a word meaning "priest". As seen in the saga of Hrafnkell Freysgo√∞i, however,
being a priest consisted merely of offering periodic sacrifices to the Norse
gods and goddesses; it was not a full-time role, nor did it involve ordination.
In some religions, being a priest or priestess is by human election or human
choice. In Judaism the priesthood is inherited in familial lines. Etymology.
The word "priest" is ultimately from Greek, via Latin "presbyter", the term for
"elder", especially elders of Jewish or Christian communities in Late
Antiquity. It is possible that the Latin word was loaned into Old English, and
only from Old English reached other Germanic languages via the Anglo-Saxon
mission to the continent, giving Old Icelandic "prestr", Old Swedish
"pr√§ster", Old High German "priast". Old High German also has the disyllabic
"priester, priestar", apparently derived from Latin independently via Old
French "presbtre". The Latin "presbyter" ultimately represents Greek
"presbyteros", the regular Latin word for "priest" being "sacerdos",
corresponding to Greek "hiereus". That English should have only the single term
"priest" to translate "presbyter" and "sacerdos" came to be seen as a problem
in English Bible translations. The "presbyter" is the minister who both
presides and instructs a Christian congregation, while the "sacerdos", offerer
of sacrifices, or in a Christian context the eucharist, performs "mediatorial
offices between God and man". The feminine English noun, "priestess", was
coined in the 17th century, to refer to female priests of the pre-Christian
religions of classical antiquity. In the 20th century, the word was used in
controversies surrounding the ordination of women. In the case of the
ordination of women in the Anglican communion, it is more common to speak of
"priests", regardless of gender. Historical religions. In historical
polytheism, a priest administers the sacrifice to a deity, often in highly
elaborate ritual. In the Ancient Near East, the priesthood also acted on behalf
of the deities in managing their property. Priestesses in antiquity often
performed sacred prostitution, and in Ancient Greece, some priestesses such as
Pythia, priestess at Delphi, acted as oracles. Ancient Egypt. In Egyptian
ideology, the right and obligation to interact with the gods belonged to the
pharaoh. He delegated this duty to priests, who were effectively bureaucrats
authorized to act on his behalf. Priests staffed temples throughout Egypt,
giving offerings to the cult statues in which the gods were believed to take up
residence and performing other rituals for their benefit. Little is known about
what training may have been required of priests, and the selection of personnel
for positions was affected by a tangled set of traditions, although the pharaoh
had the final say. In the New Kingdom, when temples owned great estates, the
high priests of the most important cult‚Äîthat of Amun at Karnak‚Äîwere
important political figures. High-ranking priestly roles were usually held by
men. Women were generally relegated to lower positions in the temple hierarchy,
although some held specialized and influential positions, especially that of
the God's Wife of Amun, whose religious importance overshadowed the High
Priests of Amun in the Late Period. Ancient Rome. In Ancient Rome and
throughout Italy, the ancient sanctuaries of Ceres and Proserpina were
invariably led by female "sacerdotes", drawn from women of local and Roman
elites. It was the only public priesthood attainable by Roman matrons and was
held in great honor. Abrahamic religions. Judaism. In ancient Israel the
priests were required by the Law of Moses to be of direct paternal descendency
from Aaron, Moses' elder brother. In Exodus 30:22-25 God instructs Moses to
make a holy anointing oil to consecrate the priests "for all of eternity."
During the times of the two Jewish Temples in Jerusalem, the Aaronic priests
were responsible for the daily and special Jewish holiday offerings and
sacrifices within the temples, these offerings are known as the "korbanot". In
Hebrew the word "priest" is "kohen" (singular ◊õ◊î◊ü "kohen", plural
◊õ÷º◊î◊ ÷¥◊ô◊ù "kohanim"), hence the family names "Cohen", "Cahn", "Kahn",
"Kohn", "Kogan", etc. These families are from the tribe of Levi (Levites) and
in twenty-four instances are called by scripture as such (Jerusalem Talmud to
Mishnaic tractate Maaser Sheini p.¬ 31a). Since the destruction of the Second
Temple, and (therefore) the cessation of the daily and seasonal temple
ceremonies and sacrifices, Kohanim in traditional Judaism (Orthodox Judaism and
to some extent, Conservative Judaism) continue to perform a number of priestly
ceremonies and roles such as the Pidyon HaBen (redemption of a first-born son)
ceremony and the Priestly Blessing, and have remained subject, particularly in
Orthodox Judaism, to a number of restrictions, such as restrictions on certain
marriages and ritual purity (see Kohanic disqualifications). Orthodox Judaism
regard the "kohanim" as being held in reserve for a future restored Temple. In
all branches of Judaism, Kohanim do not perform roles of propitiation,
sacrifice, or sacrament. Rather, a "kohen"'s principal religious function is to
perform the Priestly Blessing, and, provided he is rabbinically qualified, to
serve as an authoritative judge ("posek") and expositor of Jewish halakha law.
Christianity. With the growth of the Catholic Church and the formation of
parishes, the word "priest" ("·º±ŒµœÅŒµœçœÇ", "sacerdos"), which Christians had
since the 3rd century applied to bishops and only in a secondary sense to
presbyters, began in the 6th century to be used of presbyters, and is today
commonly used of presbyters, distinguishing them from bishops. Today the term
"priest" is used in Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, Anglicanism, and some
branches of Lutheranism to refer to those who have been ordained to a
ministerial position through receiving the sacrament of Holy Orders, although
"presbyter" is also used. Since the Protestant Reformation, non-sacramental
denominations are more likely to use the term "elder" to refer to their
pastors. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Mormon) upholds all
priesthood positions of the primitive gospel of Jesus Christ by the ordination
of the laying on of hands by one in authority to act in Christ's name, namely
deacons, teachers, priests, elders, high priests, patriarchs and apostles. The
New Testament Epistle to the Hebrews draws a distinction between the Jewish
priesthood and the high priesthood of Christ; it teaches that the sacrificial
atonement by Jesus Christ on Calvary has made the Jewish priesthood and its
prescribed ritual sacrifices redundant, along with the rest of the ceremonial
acts of the Mosaic law. Thus, for Christians, Christ himself is the only high
priest, and Christians have no priesthood independent or distinct from
participation in the priesthood of Christ, the head of the Church. The one
sacrifice of Christ, which he offered "once for all" () on the Cross, provides
eternal sanctification and redemption. Catholics, Eastern Orthodox, High Church
Anglicans, Lutherans, and some Methodists consider the sacrifice to be "re-
presented" in the Eucharist. The most known form of distinctive clothing for
the priest is the easily identifiable clerical collar (or Roman collar), which
takes form in either the traditional cassock, or modern day clerical shirt. The
typical modern version consists of a white plastic tab, inserted into a
specially made collar of a black shirt, although traditional cloth collars are
still worn. Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy. The most significant liturgical
acts reserved to priests in these traditions are the administration of the
Sacraments, including the celebration of the Holy Mass or Divine Liturgy (the
terms for the celebration of the Eucharist in the Latin and Byzantine
traditions, respectively), and the Sacrament of Reconciliation, also called
Confession. The sacraments of Anointing of the Sick (Extreme Unction) and
Confirmation or Chrismation are also administered by priests, though in the
Western tradition Confirmation is ordinarily celebrated by a bishop. In the
East, Chrismation is performed by the priest (using oil specially consecrated
by a bishop) immediately after Baptism, and Unction is normally performed by
several priests (ideally seven), but may be performed by one if necessary. In
the West, Holy Baptism may be celebrated by anyone and Matrimony may be
witnessed by a deacon, but most often these normally are administered by a
priest as well. In the East, Holy Baptism and Marriage (which is called
"Crowning") may be performed only by a priest. If a person is baptized "in
extremis" (i.e., when in fear of immediate death), only the actual threefold
immersion together with the scriptural words () may be performed by a layperson
or deacon. The remainder of the rite, and Chrismation, must still be performed
by a priest, if the person survives. The only sacrament which may be celebrated
only by a bishop is that of Ordination ("cheirotonia", "Laying-on of Hands"),
or Holy Orders. In these traditions, only men who meet certain requirements may
become priests. In Roman Catholicism the canonical minimum age is twenty-five.
Bishops may dispense with this rule and ordain men up to one year younger.
Dispensations of more than a year are reserved to the Holy See (Can. 1031
¬ß¬ß1, 4.) A Catholic priest must be incardinated by his bishop or his major
religious superior in order to engage in public ministry. In Orthodoxy, the
normal minimum age is thirty (Can. 9 of Neocaesarea) but a bishop may dispense
with this if needed. In neither tradition may priests marry after ordination.
In the Roman Catholic Church, priests in the Latin Rite, which covers the vast
majority of Roman Catholicism, must be celibate except under special rules for
married clergy converting from certain other Christian confessions. Married men
may become priests in Eastern Orthodoxy and the Eastern Catholic Churches, but
in neither case may they marry after ordination, even if they become widowed.
Candidates for bishop are chosen only from among the celibate. Orthodox priests
will either wear a clerical collar similar to the above mentioned, or simply a
very loose black robe that does not have a collar. Anglican or Episcopalian.
The role of a priest in the Anglican Communion is largely the same as within
the Roman Catholic Church and Eastern Christianity, except that canon law in
almost every Anglican province restricts the administration of confirmation to
the bishop, just as with ordination. Whilst Anglican priests who are members of
religious orders must remain celibate (although there are exceptions, such as
priests in the Anglican Order of Cistercians), the secular clergy ‚Äì (bishops,
priests, and deacons who are not members of religious orders) ‚Äì are permitted
to marry before or after ordination. The Anglican churches, unlike the Roman
Catholic or Eastern Christian traditions, have allowed the ordination of women
as priests in some provinces since 1971. This practice remains controversial,
however; a minority of provinces (ten out the thirty-eight worldwide) retain an
all-male priesthood. Most Continuing Anglican churches do not ordain women to
the priesthood. As Anglicanism represents a broad range of theological opinion,
its presbyterate includes priests who consider themselves no different in any
respect from those of the Roman Catholic Church, and a minority who prefer to
use the title "presbyter" in order to distance themselves from the more
sacrificial theological implications which they associate with the word
‚Äúpriest.‚Äù While priest is the official title of a member of the
presbyterate in every Anglican province worldwide, the ordination rite of
certain provinces (including the Church of England) recognizes the breadth of
opinion by adopting the title "The Ordination of Priests (also called
Presbyters)". Historically, the term ‚Äúpriest‚Äù has been more associated with
the ‚ÄúHigh Church‚Äù or Anglo-Catholic wing, whereas the term ‚Äúminister‚Äù
has been more commonly used in ‚ÄúLow Church‚Äù or Evangelical circles.
Protestantism. The general priesthood or the priesthood of all believers, is a
Christian doctrine derived from several passages of the New Testament. It is a
foundational concept of Protestantism. It is this doctrine that Martin Luther
adduces in his 1520 "To the Christian Nobility of the German Nation" in order
to dismiss the medieval Christian belief that Christians were to be divided
into two classes: "spiritual" and "temporal" or non-spiritual. The conservative
reforms of Lutherans are reflected in the theological and practical view of the
ministry of the Church. Much of European Lutheranism follows the traditional
catholic governance of deacon, priest and bishop. The Lutheran archbishops of
Finland, Sweden, etc. and Baltic countries are the historic national primates
or See of the original Catholic Church and some ancient cathedrals and parishes
in the Lutheran church were constructed many centuries before the Reformation.
Indeed, ecumenical work within the Anglican communion and among Scandinavian
Lutherans mutually recognize the historic apostolic legitimacy and full
communion. Likewise in America, Lutherans have embraced the apostolic
succession of bishops in the full communion with Episcopalians and most
Lutheran ordinations are performed by a bishop. The Catholic Church, however,
does not recognise Episcopalians or Lutherans as having legitimate apostolic
succession. Ordained Protestant clergy often have the title of pastor,
minister, reverend, etc. In some Lutheran churches, ordained clergy are called
priests, while in others the term pastor is preferred. Islam. No single Islamic
office encompasses all the meanings of "priest" in the Christian sense, and
some priestly functions are not performed by any office. The title mullah,
commonly translated "cleric" in the West and thought to be analogous to
"priest", is a title of address for any educated or respected figure, not even
necessarily (though frequently) religious. The nearest Islamic analogue to the
parish priest, or to the "pulpit rabbi" of a synagogue, is the "imam khatib."
This compound title is merely a common combination of two elementary offices:
leader "(imam)" of the congregational prayer, which in larger mosques is
performed at the times of all daily prayers; and preacher "(khatib)" of the
sermon or "khutba" at the required congregational prayer on Friday. Eastern
religions. Hinduism. Hindu priests historically were members of the Brahmin
caste. Priests are ordained and trained as well. There are two types of Hindu
priests, "pujaris" and "purohits". A "pujari" performs rituals in a temple.
These rituals include bathing the "murtis" (the statues of the gods/goddesses),
performing "puja", a ritualistic offering of various items to the Gods, the
waving of a "ghee" or oil lamp also called an offering in light, known in
Hinduism as "aarti", before the "murtis". "Pujaris" are often married. A
"purohit", on the other hand, performs rituals and "sa·πÉskƒÅras" (sacraments)
outside of the temple. There are special "purohits" who perform only funeral
rites. In many cases, a "purohit" also functions as a "pujari". Both women and
men are ordained as "purohits" and "pujaris". Zoroastrianism. In
Zoroastrianism, the priesthood is reserved for men and is a mostly hereditary
position. The priests prepare a drink from a sacred plant, which is called the
"haoma" ritual. They officiate the "Yasna", pouring libations into the sacred
fire to the accompaniment of ritual chants. Taoism. The Taoist priest is called
a Daoshi (ÈÅìÂ£´ "master of the Dao" p.¬ 488). Daoshi act as interpreters of
the principles of Yin-Yang 5 elements (fire, water, soil, wood, and metal
p.¬ 53) school of ancient Chinese philosophy, as they relate to marriage,
death, festival cycles, and so on. The Daoshi seeks to share the benefits of
meditation with his or her community through public ritual and liturgy
(p.¬ 326). In the ancient priesthood before the Tang, the priest was called
"Jijiu" ("libationer" p.¬ 550), with both male and female practitioners
selected by merit. The system gradually changed into a male only hereditary
"Daoshi" priesthood until more recent times (p.¬ 550,551). Indigenous and
ethnic religions. Shintoism. The shinto priest is called a , originally
pronounced "kamunushi", sometimes referred to as a . A Kannushi is the person
responsible for the maintenance of a Shinto shrine, or jinja, purificatory
rites, and for leading worship and veneration of a certain kami. Additionally,
priests are aided by for many rites as a kind of shaman or medium. The maidens
may either be family members in training, apprentices, or local volunteers.
Saiin were female relatives of the Japanese emperor (termed sai≈ç) who served
as High Priestesses in Kamo Shrine. Sai≈ç also served at Ise Shrine. Saiin
priestesses usually were elected from royalty. In principle, Saiin remained
unmarried, but there were exceptions. Some Saiin became consorts of the
emperor, called Ny≈çgo in Japanese. The Saiin order of priestesses existed
throughout the Heian and Kamakura periods. Africa. The Yoruba people of western
Nigeria practice an indigenous religion with a religious hierarchy of priests
and priestesses that dates to AD 800-1000. If√° priests and priestesses bear
the titles Babalowo for men and Iyanifa for females Priests and priestess of
the varied Orisha are titled Babalorisa for men and Iyalorisa for women [http:/

Initiates are also given an Orisa or If√° name that signifies under which deity
they are initiated. For example a Priestess of Oshun may be named Osunyemi and
a Priest of If√° may be named If√°yemi. This ancient culture continues to this
day as initiates from all around the world return to Nigeria for initiation
into the traditional priesthood. Wicca. According to Wiccan tradition, there is
no separation between "clergy" and "congregation" and all initiates are
generally considered to be priestesses and priests, though there is a growing
movement toward allowing laity and not requiring active participation in
circles. Dress. The dress of religious workers in ancient times may be
demonstrated in frescoes and artifacts from the cultures. The dress is presumed
to be related to the customary clothing of the culture, with some symbol of the
deity worn on the head or held by the person. Sometimes special colors,
materials, or patterns distinguish celebrants, as the white wool veil draped on
the head of the Vestal Virgins. Occasionally the celebrants at religious
ceremonies shed all clothes in a symbolic gesture of purity. This was often the
case in ancient times. An example of this is shown to the left on a Kylix
dating from c. 500 BC where a priestess is featured. Modern religious groups
tend to avoid such symbolism and some may be quite uncomfortable with the
concept. The retention of long skirts and vestments among many ranks of
contemporary priests when they officiate may be interpreted to express the
ancient traditions of the cultures from which their religious practices arose.
In most Christian traditions, priests wear clerical clothing, a distinctive
form of street dress. Even within individual traditions it varies considerably
in form, depending on the specific occasion. In Western Christianity, the stiff
white clerical collar has become the nearly universal feature of priestly
clerical clothing, worn either with a cassock or a clergy shirt. The collar may
be either a full collar or a vestigial tab displayed through a square cutout in
the shirt collar. Eastern Christian priests mostly retain the traditional dress
of two layers of differently cut cassock: the "rasson" (Greek) or "podriasnik"
(Russian) beneath the outer "exorasson" (Greek) or "riasa" (Russian). If a
pectoral cross has been awarded it is usually worn with street clothes in the
Russian tradition, but not so often in the Greek tradition. Distinctive
clerical clothing is less often worn in modern times than formerly, and in many
cases it is rare for a priest to wear it when not acting in a pastoral
capacity, especially in countries that view themselves as largely secular in
nature. There are frequent exceptions to this however, and many priests rarely
if ever go out in public without it, especially in countries where their
religion makes up a clear majority of the population. Pope John Paul II often
instructed Catholic priests and religious to always wear their distinctive
(clerical) clothing, unless wearing it would result in persecution or grave
verbal attacks. Christian traditions that retain the title of priest also
retain the tradition of special liturgical vestments worn only during services.
Vestments vary widely among the different Christian traditions. In modern Pagan
religions, such as Wicca, there is no specific form of dress relegated to the
clergy. If there is, such as in some denominations of Wicca, it is a particular
of the denomination in question, and not a universal practice. However, there
is a traditional form of dress, usually a floor-length tunic and a knotted cord
cincture, known as the "cingulum". Assistant priest. In many religions there
are one or more layers of assistant priests. In the Ancient Near East,
hierodules served in temples as assistants to the priestess. In ancient
Judaism, the Priests (Kohanim) had a whole class of Levites as their assistants
in making the sacrifices, in singing psalms and in maintaining the Temple. The
Priests and the Levites were in turn served by servants called Nethinim. These
lowest level of servants were not priests. An assistant priest is a priest in
the Anglican and Episcopal churches who is not the senior member of clergy of
the parish to which they are appointed, but is nonetheless in priests' orders;
there is no difference in function or theology, merely in 'grade' or 'rank'.
Some assistant priests have a "sector ministry", that is to say that they
specialize in a certain area of ministry within the local church, for example
youth work, hospital work, or ministry to local light industry. They may also
hold some diocesan appointment part-time. In most (though not all) cases an
assistant priest has the legal status of assistant curate, although it should
also be noted that not all assistant curates are priests, as this legal status
also applies to many deacons working as assistants in a parochial setting. The
corresponding term in the Catholic Church is "parochial vicar" - an ordained
priest assigned to assist the pastor (Latin: "parochus") of a parish in the
pastoral care of parishioners. Normally, all pastors are also ordained priests;
occasionally an auxiliary bishop will be assigned that role.
