Sufism Sufism or () is defined by its adherents as the inner, mystical
dimension of Islam. A practitioner of this tradition is generally known as a
(). Sufis believe they are practicing Ihsan (perfection of worship) as revealed
by Gabriel to Muhammad, "Worship and serve Allah as you are seeing Him and
while you see Him not yet truly He sees you." Classical Sufi scholars have
defined Sufism as "a science whose objective is the reparation of the heart and
turning it away from all else but God". Alternatively, in the words of the
Darqawi Sufi teacher Ahmad ibn Ajiba, "a science through which one can know how
to travel into the presence of the Divine, purify one's inner self from filth,
and beautify it with a variety of praiseworthy traits". Classical Sufis were
characterised by their attachment to dhikr (a practice of repeating the names
of God) and asceticism. Sufism gained adherents among a number of Muslims as a
reaction against the worldliness of the early Umayyad Caliphate (661-750 CE).
Sufis have spanned several continents and cultures over a millennium, at first
expressed through Arabic, then through Persian, Turkish and a dozen other
languages. "Orders" ("·π≠uruq"), which are either Sunnƒ´ or Shƒ´'ƒ´ or mixed in
doctrine, trace many of their original precepts from the Islamic Prophet
Muhammad through his cousin and son-in-law 'Alƒ´, with the notable exception of
the Naqshbandi who trace their origins through the first Caliph, Abu Bakr.
Other exclusive schools of Sufism describe themselves as distinctly Sufi.
Modern Sufis often perform dhikr after the conclusion of prayers. Some
mainstream scholars of Islam define sufism as simply the name for the inner or
esoteric dimension of Islam. Ren√© Gu√©non in "Insights into Islamic Esoterism
and Taoism" (Sophia Perennis 2003) contended that Sufism was the esoteric
aspect of Islam supported and complemented by exoteric practices and Islamic
law. However, according to Idries Shah, the Sufi philosophy is universal in
nature, its roots predating the rise of Islam and the other modern-day
religions, save for perhaps Buddhism and Jainism; likewise, some Muslims
consider Sufism outside the sphere of Islam. Etymology and origin of the term.
Two origins of the word "sufi" have been suggested. Commonly, the lexical root
of the word is traced to ' (), which in Arabic means "purity". Another origin
is ' (), "wool", referring to the simple cloaks the early Muslim ascetics wore.
The two were combined by the Sufi al-Rudhabari who said, "The Sufi is the one
who wears wool on top of purity." The wool cloaks were sometimes a designation
of their initiation into the Sufi order. Others have suggested that word comes
from the term "" ("the people of the bench"), who were a group of impoverished
companions of Muhammad who held regular gatherings of "dhikr". According to the
medieval Iranian scholar Ab≈´ Ray·∏•ƒÅn al-Bƒ´r≈´nƒ´, the word "s≈´fi" is
derived from the Greek word "sofia" (), meaning wisdom. Basic views. While all
Muslims believe that they are on the pathway to God and hope to become close to
God in Paradise‚Äîafter death and after the "Final Judgment"‚ÄîSufis also
believe that it is possible to draw closer to God and to more fully embrace the
Divine Presence in this life. The chief aim of all Sufis is to seek the
pleasing of God by working to restore within themselves the primordial state of
"fitra", described in the Qur'an. In this state nothing one does defies God,
and all is undertaken with the single motivation of love of God. A secondary
consequence of this is that the seeker may be led to abandon all notions of
dualism or multiplicity, including a conception of an individual self, and to
realize the Divine Unity. Thus, Sufism has been characterized as the science of
the states of the lower self (the ego), and the way of purifying this lower
self of its reprehensible traits, while adorning it instead with what is
praiseworthy, whether or not this process of cleansing and purifying the heart
is in time rewarded by esoteric knowledge of God. This can be conceived in
terms of two basic types of law ("fiqh"), an outer law concerned with actions,
and an inner law concerned with the human heart. The outer law consists of
rules pertaining to worship, transactions, marriage, judicial rulings, and
criminal law‚Äîwhat is often referred to, a bit too broadly, as "qanun". The
inner law of Sufism consists of rules about repentance from sin, the purging of
contemptible qualities and evil traits of character, and adornment with virtues
and good character. Sufism, which is a general term for Muslim mysticism, was
originally a response to the increasing worldly power of Islamic leaders as the
religion spread during the 8th Century and their corresponding shift in focus
towards materialistic and political concerns. In particular, Harun al-Rashid,
the fifth Abbasid Caliph, attracted negative attention for his lavish
lifestyle, including gold and silver tableware, an extensive harem and numerous
slaves and retainers, that stood in contrast to the relative simplicity of
Muhammad's life. The typical early Sufi lived in a cell of a mosque and taught
a small band of disciples. The extent to which Sufism was influenced by
Buddhist and Hindu mysticism, and by the example of Christian hermits and
monks, is disputed, but self-discipline and concentration on God quickly led to
the belief that by quelling the self and through loving ardour for God it is
possible to maintain a union with the divine in which the human self melts
away. Teaching. To enter the way of Sufism, the seeker begins by finding a
teacher, as the connection to the teacher is considered necessary for the
growth of the pupil. The teacher, to be considered genuine, must have received
the authorization to teach ("ijazah") from another Master of the Way, in an
unbroken succession ("silsilah") leading back to Muhammad. It is the
transmission of the divine light from the teacher's heart to the heart of the
student, rather than of worldly knowledge transmitted from mouth to ear, that
allows the adept to progress. In addition, the genuine teacher will be utterly
strict in his adherence to the Divine Law. Scholars and adherents of Sufism are
unanimous in agreeing that Sufism cannot be learned through books. To reach the
highest levels of success in Sufism typically requires that the disciple live
with and serve the teacher for many, many years. For instance, Baha-ud-Din
Naqshband Bukhari, who gave his name to the Naqshbandi Order, served his first
teacher, Sayyid Muhammad Baba As-Samasi, for 20 years, until as-Samasi died. He
subsequently served several other teachers for lengthy periods of time. The
extreme arduousness of his spiritual preparation is illustrated by his service,
as directed by his teacher, to the weak and needy members of his community in a
state of complete humility and tolerance for many years. When he believed this
mission to be concluded, his teacher next directed him to care for animals,
curing their sicknesses, cleaning their wounds, and assisting them in finding
provision. After many years of this he was next instructed to spend many years
in the care of dogs in a state of humility, and to ask them for support. As a
further example, the prospective adherent of the Mevlevi Order would have been
ordered to serve in the kitchens of a hospice for the poor for 1,001 days prior
to being accepted for spiritual instruction, and a further 1,001 days in
solitary retreat as a precondition of completing that instruction. Some
teachers, especially when addressing more general audiences, or mixed groups of
Muslims and non-Muslims, make extensive use of parable, allegory, and metaphor.
Although approaches to teaching vary among different Sufi orders, Sufism as a
whole is primarily concerned with direct personal experience, and as such has
sometimes been compared to other, non-Islamic forms of mysticism (e.g., as in
the books of Hossein Nasr). History of Sufism. Origins. In its early stages of
development Sufism effectively referred to nothing more than the
internalization of Islam. According to one perspective, it is directly from the
Qur'an, constantly recited, meditated, and experienced, that Sufism proceeded,
in its origin and its development. Others have held that Sufism is the strict
emulation of the way of Muhammad, through which the heart's connection to the
Divine is strengthened. More prosaically, the Muslim Conquests had brought
large numbers of Christian monks and hermits, especially in Syria and Egypt,
under the rule of Muslims. They retained a vigorous spiritual life for
centuries after the conquests, and many of the especially pious Muslims who
founded Sufism were influenced by their techniques and methods. From the
traditional Sufi point of view, the esoteric teachings of Sufism were
transmitted from Muhammad to those who had the capacity to acquire the direct
experience gnosis of God, which was passed on from teacher to student through
the centuries. Some of this transmission is summarized in texts, but most is
not. Important contributions in writing are attributed to Uwais al-Qarni, Harrm
bin Hian, Hasan Basri and Sayid ibn al-Mussib, who are regarded as the first
Sufis in the earliest generations of Islam. Harith al-Muhasibi was the first
one to write about moral psychology. Rabia Basri was a Sufi known for her love
and passion for God, expressed through her poetry. Bayazid Bastami was among
the first theorists of Sufism; he concerned himself with "fanƒÅ" and "baqƒÅ",
the state of annihilating the self in the presence of the divine, accompanied
by clarity concerning worldly phenomena derived from that perspective. Sufism
had a long history already before the subsequent institutionalization of Sufi
teachings into devotional orders ("tar√Æq√¢t") in the early Middle Ages. Almost
all extant Sufi orders trace their chains of transmission ("silsila") back to
Muhammad via his cousin and son-in-law Ali. The Naqshbandi order is a notable
exception to this rule, as it traces the origin of its teachings from Muhammad
to the first Islamic Caliph, Abu Bakr. Different devotional styles and
traditions developed over time, reflecting the perspectives of different
masters and the accumulated cultural wisdom of the orders. Typically all of
these concerned themselves with the understanding of subtle knowledge (gnosis),
education of the heart to purify it of baser instincts, the love of God, and
approaching God through a well-described hierarchy of enduring spiritual
stations ("maq√¢m√¢t") and more transient spiritual states ("ahw√¢l").
Formalization of doctrine. Towards the end of the first millennium CE, a number
of manuals began to be written summarizing the doctrines of Sufism and
describing some typical Sufi practices. Two of the most famous of these are now
available in English translation: the "Kashf al-Mahj√ªb" of Hujwiri, and the
"Ris√¢la" of Qushayri. Two of Imam Al Ghazali's greatest treatises, the
"Revival of Religious Sciences" and the "Alchemy of Happiness", argued that
Sufism originated from the Qur'an and was thus compatible with mainstream
Islamic thought, and did not in any way contradict Islamic Law‚Äîbeing instead
necessary to its complete fulfillment. This became the mainstream position
among Islamic scholars for centuries, challenged only recently on the basis of
selective use of a limited body of texts . Ongoing efforts by both
traditionally trained Muslim scholars and Western academics are making Imam Al-
Ghazali's works available in English translation for the first time, allowing
English-speaking readers to judge for themselves the compatibility of Islamic
Law and Sufi doctrine. Growth of Sufi influence in Islamic cultures. The spread
of Sufism has been considered a definitive factor in the spread of Islam, and
in the creation of integrally Islamic cultures, especially in Africa and Asia.
Persian Sufi poets and philosophers such as Rumi and Attar of Nishapur greatly
enhanced the spread of Islamic culture in Anatolia, Central Asia, and South
Asia. Sufism also played a role in creating and propagating the culture of the
Ottoman world, and in resisting European imperialism in North Africa and South
Asia. Between the 13th and 16th centuries CE, Sufism produced a flourishing
intellectual culture throughout the Islamic world, a "Golden Age" whose
physical artifacts are still present. In many places, a lodge (known variously
as a "zaouia", "khanqah", or "tekke") would be endowed through a pious
foundation in perpetuity ("waqf") to provide a gathering place for Sufi adepts,
as well as lodging for itinerant seekers of knowledge. The same system of
endowments could also be used to pay for a complex of buildings, such as that
surrounding the S√ºleymaniye Mosque in Istanbul, including a lodge for Sufi
seekers, a hospice with kitchens where these seekers could serve the poor and/
or complete a period of initiation, a library, and other structures. No
important domain in the civilization of Islam remained unaffected by Sufism in
this period. Contemporary Sufism. Current Sufi orders include Ba 'Alawiyya,
Chishti, Naqshbandi, Jerrahi, Nimatullahi, Oveyssi, Qadiria Boutshishia,
Qadiriyyah, Qalandariyya, Sarwari Qadiri, Shadhliyya and Suhrawardiyya. Sufism
is popular in such African countries as Morocco and Senegal, where it is seen
as a mystical expression of Islam. Sufism is traditional in Morocco but has
seen a growing revival with the renewal of sufism around contemporary spiritual
teachers such as Sidi Hamza al Qadiri al Boutshishi. Mbacke suggests that one
reason Sufism has taken hold in Senegal is because it can accommodate local
beliefs and customs, which tend toward the mystical. The life of the Algerian
Sufi master Emir Abd al-Qadir is instructive in this regard. Notable as well
are the lives of Amadou Bamba and Hajj Umar Tall in sub-Saharan Africa, and
Sheikh Mansur Ushurma and Imam Shamil in the Caucasus region. In the twentieth
century some more modernist Muslims have called Sufism a superstitious religion
that holds back Islamic achievement in the fields of science and technology. A
number of Westerners have embarked with varying degrees of success on the path
of Sufism. One of the first to return to Europe as an official representative
of a Sufi order, and with the specific purpose to spread Sufism in Western
Europe, was the Swedish-born wandering Sufi Abd al-Hadi Aqhili (also known as
Ivan Agu√©li). Ren√© Gu√©non, the French scholar, became a sufi in the early
twentieth century and was known as Sheikh Abdul Wahid Yahya. His manifold
writings defined the practice of sufism as the essence of Islam but also
pointed to the universality of its message. Other spiritualists, such as G. I.
Gurdjieff, may or may not conform to the tenets of Sufism as understood by
orthodox Muslims. Other noteworthy Sufi teachers who have been active in the
West in recent years include Bawa Muhaiyaddeen, Inayat Khan, Nazim Al-Haqqani,
Javad Nurbakhsh, Bulent Rauf, Irina Tweedie, Idries Shah and Muzaffer Ozak.
Currently active Sufi academics and publishers include Llewellyn Vaughan-Lee,
Nuh Ha Mim Keller, Abdullah Nooruddeen Durkee, Abdal Hakim Murad and the
Franco-Moroccan Faouzi Skali. Theoretical perspectives in Sufism. Traditional
Islamic scholars have recognized two major branches within the practice of
Sufism, and use this as one key to differentiating among the approaches of
different masters and devotional lineages. On the one hand there is the order
from the signs to the Signifier (or from the arts to the Artisan). In this
branch, the seeker begins by purifying the lower self of every corrupting
influence that stands in the way of recognizing all of creation as the work of
God, as God's active Self-disclosure or theophany. This is the way of Imam Al-
Ghazali and of the majority of the Sufi orders. On the other hand there is the
order from the Signifier to His signs, from the Artisan to His works. In this
branch the seeker experiences divine attraction ("jadhba"), and is able to
enter the order with a glimpse of its endpoint, of direct apprehension of the
Divine Presence towards which all spiritual striving is directed. This does not
replace the striving to purify the heart, as in the other branch; it simply
stems from a different point of entry into the path. This is the way primarily
of the masters of the Naqshbandi and Shadhili orders. Contemporary scholars may
also recognize a third branch, attributed to the late Ottoman scholar Said
Nursi and explicated in his vast Qur'an commentary called the Risale-i Nur.
This approach entails strict adherence to the way of Muhammad, in the
understanding that this wont, or "sunnah", proposes a complete devotional
spirituality adequate to those without access to a master of the Sufi way.
Contributions to other domains of scholarship. Sufism has contributed
significantly to the elaboration of theoretical perspectives in many domains of
intellectual endeavor. For instance, the doctrine of "subtle centers" or
centers of subtle cognition (known as "Lataif-e-sitta") addresses the matter of
the awakening of spiritual intuition in ways that some consider similar to
certain models of "chakra" in Hinduism. In general, these subtle centers or
"lat√¢'if" are thought of as faculties that are to be purified sequentially in
order to bring the seeker's wayfaring to completion. A concise and useful
summary of this system from a living exponent of this tradition has been
published by Muhammad Emin Er. Sufi psychology has influenced many areas of
thinking both within and outside of Islam, drawing primarily upon three
concepts. Ja'far al-Sadiq (both an imam in the Shia tradition and a respected
scholar and link in chains of Sufi transmission in all Islamic sects) held that
human beings are dominated by a lower self called the "nafs", a faculty of
spiritual intuition called the "qalb" or spiritual heart, and a spirit or soul
called "ruh". These interact in various ways, producing the spiritual types of
the tyrant (dominated by "nafs"), the person of faith and moderation (dominated
by the spiritual heart), and the person lost in love for God (dominated by the
"ruh"). Of note with regard to the spread of Sufi psychology in the West is
Robert Frager, a Sufi teacher authorized in the Khalwati Jerrahi order. Frager
was a trained psychologist, born in the United States, who converted to Islam
in the course of his practice of Sufism and wrote extensively on Sufism and
psychology. Sufi cosmology and Sufi metaphysics are also noteworthy areas of
intellectual accomplishment. Sufi practices. The devotional practices of Sufis
vary widely. This is because an acknowledged and authorized master of the Sufi
path is in effect a physician of the heart, able to diagnose the seeker's
impediments to knowledge and pure intention in serving God, and to prescribe to
the seeker a course of treatment appropriate to his or her maladies. The
consensus among Sufi scholars is that the seeker cannot self-diagnose, and that
it can be extremely harmful to undertake any of these practices alone and
without formal authorization. My servant draws near to Me through nothing I
love more than that which I have made obligatory for him. My servant never
ceases drawing near to Me through supererogatory works until I love him. Then,
when I love him, I am his hearing through which he hears, his sight through
which he sees, his hand through which he grasps, and his foot through which he
walks. It is also necessary for the seeker to have a correct creed ("Aqidah"),
and to embrace with certainty its tenets. The seeker must also, of necessity,
turn away from sins, love of this world, the love of company and renown,
obedience to satanic impulse, and the promptings of the lower self. (The way in
which this purification of the heart is achieved is outlined in certain books,
but must be prescribed in detail by a Sufi master.) The seeker must also be
trained to prevent the corruption of those good deeds which have accrued to his
or her credit by overcoming the traps of ostentation, pride, arrogance, envy,
and long hopes (meaning the hope for a long life allowing us to mend our ways
later, rather than immediately, here and now). Sufi practices, while attractive
to some, are not a "means" for gaining knowledge. The traditional scholars of
Sufism hold it as absolutely axiomatic that knowledge of God is not a
psychological state generated through breath control. Thus, practice of
"techniques" is not the cause, but instead the "occasion" for such knowledge to
be obtained (if at all), given proper prerequisites and proper guidance by a
master of the way. Furthermore, the emphasis on practices may obscure a far
more important fact: The seeker is, in a sense, to become a broken person,
stripped of all habits through the practice of (in the words of Imam Al-
Ghazali) solitude, silence, sleeplessness, and hunger. Magic has also been a
part of Sufi practice, notably in India. This practice intensified during the
declining years of Sufism in India when the Sufi orders grew steadily in wealth
and in political influence while their spirituality gradually declined as they
concentrated on Saint worship, miracle working, magic and superstition. The
external religious practices were neglected, morals declined and learning was
despised. The element of magic in Sufism in India possibly drew from the occult
practices in the Atharvaveda. The most famous of all Sufis, Mansur Al-Hallaj
(d. 922), visited Sindh in order to study "Indian Magic". He not only accepted
Hindu ideas of cosmogony and of divine descent but he also seems to have
believed in the Transmigration of the soul. Dhikr. Dhikr is the remembrance of
God commanded in the Qur'an for all Muslims through a specific devotional act,
such as the repetition of divine names, supplications and aphorisms from hadith
literature and the Qur'an. More generally, dhikr takes a wide range and various
layers of meaning. This includes dhikr as any activity in which the Muslim
maintains awareness of God. To engage in dhikr is to practice consciousness of
the Divine Presence and love, or "to seek a state of godwariness". The Qur'an
refers to Muhammad as the very embodiment of dhikr of God (65:10-11). Some
types of dhikr are prescribed for all Muslims and do not require Sufi
initiation or the prescription of a Sufi master because they are deemed to be
good for every seeker under every circumstance. Some Sufi orders engage in
ritualized dhikr ceremonies, or sema. Sema includes various forms of worship
such as: recitation, singing (the most well known being the Qawwali music of
the Indian subcontinent), instrumental music, dance (most famously the Sufi
whirling of the Mevlevi order), incense, meditation, ecstasy, and trance. Some
Sufi orders stress and place extensive reliance upon Dhikr. This practice of
Dhikr is called Dhikr-e-Qulb (remembrance of Allah by Heartbeats). The basic
idea in this practice is to visualize the Arabic name of God, Allah, as having
been written on the disciple's heart. Muraqaba. The practice of "muraqaba" can
be likened to the practices of meditation attested in many faith communities.
The word "muraqaba" is derived from the same root ("r-q-b") occurring as one of
the 99 Names of God in the Qur'an, al-Raq√Æb, meaning "the Vigilant" and
attested in verse 4: 1 of the Qur'an. Through "muraqaba", a person watches over
or takes care of the spiritual heart, acquires knowledge about it, and becomes
attuned to the Divine Presence, which is ever vigilant. Muhammad Emin Er, "Laws
of the Heart: A Practical Introduction to the Sufi Path", ISBN 978-0-9815196-1-
6, p. 77. Visitation. In popular Sufism (i.e., devotional practices that have
achieved currency in world cultures through Sufi influence), one common
practice is to visit or make pilgrimages to the tombs of saints, great
scholars, and righteous people. This is a particularly common practice in South
Asia, where famous tombs include those of Khoja AfƒÅq, near Kashgar, in China;
Lal Shahbaz Qalander, in Sindh, Pakistan; Moinuddin Chishti in Ajmer, India;
Nizamuddin Auliya in Delhi, India, and Shah Jalal in Sylhet, Bangladesh.
Likewise, in Fez, Morocco, a popular destination for such pious visitation is
the Zaouia Moulay Idriss II and the yearly visitation to see the current Sheikh
of the Qadiri Boutchichi Tariqah, Sheikh Sidi Hamza al Qadiri al Boutchichi to
celebrate the Mawlid (which is usually televised on Moroccan National
television). Persecution. "Before the first world war there were almost 100,000
disciples of the Mevlevi order throughout the Ottoman empire. But in 1925, as
part of his desire to create a modern, western-orientated, secular state,
Atat√ºrk banned all the different Sufi orders and closed their tekkes. Pious
foundations were suspended and their endowments expropriated; Sufi hospices
were closed and their contents seized; all religious titles were abolished and
dervish clothes outlawed. ... In 1937, Atat√ºrk went even further, prohibiting
by law any form of traditional music, especially the playing of the ney, the
Sufis' reed flute." The government of Iran is considering an outright ban on
Sufism, according to the 2009 Annual Report of the United States Commission on
International Religious Freedom. Islam and Sufism. Sufism and Islamic law.
Scholars and adherents of Sufism sometimes describe Sufism in terms of a
threefold approach to God as explained by a tradition ("had√Æth") attributed to
Muhammad ,""The Canon is my word, the order is my deed, and the truth is my
interior state"." Sufis believe the "canon", "order" and "truth" are mutually
interdependent. The "order", the 'path' on which the mystics walk, has been
defined as 'the path which comes out of the "Canon", for the main road is
called "branch", the path, "tariq".' No mystical experience can be realized if
the binding injunctions of the Canon are not followed faithfully first. The
path, "order", however, is narrower and more difficult to walk. It leads the
adept, called "s√¢lik" (wayfarer), in his "sul√ªk" (wayfaring), through
different stations ("maq√¢m√¢t") until he reaches his goal, the perfect
"tawh√Æd", the existential confession that God is One. Shaykh al-Akbar
Muhiuddeen Ibn Arabi mentions, "When we see someone in this Community who
claims to be able to guide others to God, but is remiss in but one rule of the
Sacred Law - even if he manifests miracles that stagger the mind - asserting
that his shortcoming is a special dispensation for him, we do not even turn to
look at him, for such a person is not a sheikh, nor is he speaking the truth,
for no one is entrusted with the secrets of God Most High save one in whom the
ordinances of the Sacred Law are preserved. (Jami' karamat al-awliya')". The
Amman Message, a detailed statement issued by 200 leading Islamic scholars in
2005 in Amman, and adopted by the Islamic world's political and temporal
leaderships at the Organisation of the Islamic Conference summit at Mecca in
December 2005, and by six other international Islamic scholarly assemblies
including the International Islamic Fiqh Academy of Jeddah, in July 2006,
specifically recognized the validity of Sufism as a part of Islam - however the
definition of sufism can vary drastically between different traditions (what
may be intended is simple tazkiah as opposed to the various manifestations of
sufism around the Islamic world). Traditional Islamic thought and Sufism. The
literature of Sufism emphasizes highly subjective matters that resist outside
observation, such as the subtle states of the heart. Often these resist direct
reference or description, with the consequence that the authors of various Sufi
treatises took recourse to allegorical language. For instance, much Sufi poetry
refers to intoxication, which Islam expressly forbids. This usage of indirect
language and the existence of interpretations by people who had no training in
Islam or Sufism led to doubts being cast over the validity of Sufism as a part
of Islam. Also, some groups emerged that considered themselves above the Sharia
and discussed Sufism as a method of bypassing the rules of Islam in order to
attain salvation directly. This was disapproved of by traditional scholars.
Traditional and Neo-Sufi groups. The traditional Sufi orders, which are in
majority, emphasize the role of Sufism as a spiritual discipline within Islam.
Therefore, the Sharia (traditional Islamic law) and the Sunnah are seen as
crucial for any Sufi aspirant. One proof traditional orders assert is that
almost all the famous Sufi masters of the past Caliphates were experts in
Sharia and were renowned as people with great Iman (faith) and excellent
practice. Many were also Qadis (Sharia law judges) in courts. They held that
Sufism was never distinct from Islam and to fully comprehend and practice
Sufism one must be an observant Muslim. "Neo-Sufism" and "universal Sufism" are
terms used to denote forms of Sufism that do not require adherence to Shariah,
or a Muslim faith. The terms are not always accepted by those it is applied to.
The Universal Sufism movement was founded by Hazrat Inayat Khan, teaches the
essential unity of all faiths, and accepts members of all creeds. Sufism
Reoriented is an offshoot of Khan's Western Sufism influenced by the
syncretistic teacher Meher Baba. The Golden Sufi Center exists in England,
Switzerland and the United States. It was founded by Llewellyn Vaughan-Lee to
continue the work of his teacher Irina Tweedie, herself a disciple of the Hindu
Naqshbandi Sufi Bhai Sahib. The Afghan-Scottish teacher Idries Shah has been
described as a neo-Sufi by the Gurdjieffian James Moore. Other Western Sufi
organisations include the Sufi Foundation of America and the International
Association of Sufism. Western Sufi practice may differ from traditional forms,
for instance having mixed-gender meetings and less emphasis on the Qur'an.
Islamic positions on non-Islamic Sufi groups. The use of the title "Sufi" by
non-traditional groups to refer to themselves, and their appropriation of
traditional Sufi masters (most notably Jalaluddin Rumi) as sources of authority
or inspiration, is not accepted by some Muslims who are Sufi adherents. Many of
the great Sufi masters of the present and the past instruct that: one needs the
form of the religious practices and the outer dimension of the religion to
fulfill the goals of the inner dimension of Sufism (Proximity to God). The
exoteric practices prescribed by God contain inner meanings and provide the
means for transformation with the proper spiritual guidance of a master. It is
thought that through the forms of the ritual and prescribed Islamic practices
(prayer, pilgrimage, fasting, charity and affirmation of Divine Unity) the soul
may be purified and one may then begin to embark on the mystical quest. In fact
it is considered psychologically dangerous by some Sufi masters to participate
in Sufi practices, such as "dhikr", without adhering to the outer aspects of
Islam, which add spiritual balance and grounding to the practice. Some
traditional Sufis also object to interpretations of classical Sufis texts by
writers who have no grounding in the traditional Islamic sciences and therefore
no prerequisites for understanding such texts. These are considered by certain
conventional Islamic scholars as beyond the pale of the religion. However,
there are Islamic Sufi groups that are open to non-Muslim participation.
Preeminent Sufis. Abul Hasan al-Shadhili. Abul Hasan al-Shadhili (died 1258
CE), the founder of the Shadhiliyya Sufi order, introduced "dhikr jahri" (The
method of remembering Allah through loud means). Sufi orders generally preach
to deny oneself and to destroy the ego-self "(nafs)" and its worldly desires.
This is sometimes characterized as the "Order of Patience-Tariqus Sabr". In
contrast, Imam Shadhili taught that his followers need not abstain from what
Islam has not forbidden, but to be grateful for what God has bestowed upon
them. This notion, known as the "Order of Gratitude-Tariqush Shukr", was
espoused by Imam Shadhili. Imam Shadhili gave eighteen valuable "hizbs"
(litanies) to his followers out of which the notable "Hizbul Bahr" is recited
worldwide even today. Bayazid Bastami. Bayazid Bastami (died 874 CE) is
considered to be "of the six bright stars in the firmament of the Prophet", and
a link in the Golden Chain of the Naqshbandi Tariqah. He is regarded as the
first mystic to openly speak of the annihilation (fanƒÅ') of the base self in
the Divine, whereby the mystic becomes fully absorbed to the point of becoming
unaware of himself or the objects around him. Every existing thing seems to
vanish, and he feels free of every barrier that could stand in the way of his
viewing the Remembered One. In one of these states, Bastami cried out: "Praise
to Me, for My greatest Glory!" His belief in the unity of all religions became
apparent when asked the question: "How does Islam view other religions?" His
reply was "All are vehicles and a path to God's Divine Presence." Ibn Arabi.
Muhyiddin Muhammad b. 'Ali Ibn 'Arabi (or Ibn al-'Arabi) AH 561- AH 638 (July
28, 1165 ‚Äì November 10, 1240) is considered to be one of the most important
Sufi masters, although he never founded any order ("tariqa"). His writings,
especially al-Futuhat al-Makkiyya and Fusus al-hikam, have been studied within
all the Sufi orders as the clearest expression of "tawhid" (Divine Unity),
though because of their recondite nature they were often only given to
initiates. Later those who followed his teaching became known as the school of
"wahdat al-wujud" (the Oneness of Being). He himself considered his writings to
have been divinely inspired. As he expressed the Way to one of his close
disciples, his legacy is that 'you should never ever abandon your servanthood
('"ubudiyya"), and that there may never be in your soul a longing for any
existing thing'. Junayd Baghdadi. Junayd Baghdadi (830-910 CE) was one of the
great early Sufis, and is a central figure in the golden chain of many Sufi
orders. He laid the groundwork for sober mysticism in contrast to that of God-
intoxicated Sufis like al-Hallaj, Bayazid Bastami and Abusaeid Abolkheir.
During the trial of al-Hallaj, his former disciple, the Caliph of the time
demanded his fatwa. In response, he issued this fatwa: "From the outward
appearance he is to die and we judge according to the outward appearance and
God knows better". He is referred to by Sufis as Sayyid-ut Taifa, i.e. the
leader of the group. He lived and died in the city of Baghdad. Mansur al-
Hallaj. Mansur al-Hallaj (died 922 CE) is renowned for his claim "Ana-l-Haqq"
(I am The Truth). His refusal to recant this utterance, which was regarded as
apostasy, led to a long trial. He was imprisoned for 11 years in a Baghdad
prison, before being tortured and publicly dismembered on March 26, 922. He is
still revered by Sufis for his willingness to embrace torture and death rather
than recant. It is said that during his prayers, he would say "O Lord! You are
the guide of those who are passing through the Valley of Bewilderment. If I am
a heretic, enlarge my heresy." Reception. Perception outside Islam. Sufi
mysticism has long exercised a fascination upon the Western world, and
especially its orientalist scholars. Figures like Rumi have become well known
in the United States, where Sufism is perceived as a peaceful and apolitical
form of Islam. The Islamic Institute in Mannheim, Germany, which works towards
the integration of Europe and Muslims, sees Sufism as particularly suited for
interreligious dialogue and intercultural harmonisation in democratic and
pluralist societies; it has described Sufism as a symbol of tolerance and
humanism¬ ‚Äì nondogmatic, flexible and non-violent. Influence of Sufism on
Judaism. A great influence was exercised by Sufism upon the ethical writings of
Jews in the Middle Ages. In the first writing of this kind, we see "Kitab al-
Hidayah ila Fara'i·∏ç al-·∏≤ulub", "Duties of the Heart", of Bahya ibn Paquda.
This book was translated by Judah ibn Tibbon into Hebrew under the title
"·∏§ovot ha-Levavot".This was precisely the argument used by the Sufis against
their adversaries, the Ulamas. The arrangement of the book seems to have been
inspired by Sufism. Its ten sections correspond to the ten stages through which
the Sufi had to pass in order to attain that true and passionate love of God
which is the aim and goal of all ethical self-discipline. A considerable amount
of Sufi ideas entered the Jewish mainstream through Bahya ibn Paquda's work,
which remains one of the most popular ethical treatises in Judaism. It is
noteworthy that in the ethical writings of the Sufis Al-Kusajri and Al-Harawi
there are sections which treat of the same subjects as those treated in the
"·∏§ovot ha-Lebabot" and which bear the same titles: e.g., "Bab al-Tawakkul";
"Bab al-Taubah"; "Bab al-Mu·∏•asabah"; "Bab al-Tawa·∏çu'"; "Bab al-Zuhd". In
the ninth gate, Ba·∏•ya directly quotes sayings of the Sufis, whom he calls
"Perushim". However, the author of the "·∏§ovot ha-Levavot" did not go so far
as to approve of the asceticism of the Sufis, although he showed a marked
predilection for their ethical principles. Abraham ben Moses ben Maimon, the
son of the Jewish philosopher Maimonides, believed that Sufi practices and
doctrines continue the tradition of the Biblical prophets. He introduced into
the Jewish prayer such practices as reciting God's names (dhikr). Some of these
Sufi-Jewish practices are still observed in a few Oriental synagogues. Abraham
Maimuni's principal work is originally composed in Judeo-Arabic and entitled
"◊õ◊™◊ê◊ë ◊õ◊§◊ô◊ê ◊ê◊ú◊¢◊ê◊ë◊ì◊ô◊ü" "KitƒÅb KifƒÅyah al-'ƒÄbidƒ´n" ("A
Comprehensive Guide for the Servants of God"). From the extant surviving
portion it is conjectured that Maimuni's treatise was three times as long as
his father's Guide for the Perplexed. In the book, Maimuni evidences a great
appreciation for, and affinity to, Sufism. Followers of his path continued to
foster a Jewish-Sufi form of pietism for at least a century, and he is rightly
considered the founder of this pietistic school, which was centered in Egypt.
The followers of this path, which they called, interchangeably, Hasidism (not
to confuse with the latter Jewish Hasidic movement) or Sufism (Tasawwuf),
practiced spiritual retreats, solitude, fasting and sleep deprivation.The
Jewish Sufis maintained their own brotherhood, guided by a religious leader -
like a Sufi sheikh. Abraham Maimuni's two sons, Obadyah and David, continued to
lead this Jewish-Sufi brotherhood. Obadyah Maimonides wrote "Al-Mawala Al
Hawdiyya" ("The Treatise of the Pool") - an ethico-mystical manual based on the
typically Sufi comparison of the heart to a pool that must be cleansed before
it can experience the Divine. The Maimonidean legacy extended right through to
the 15th century with the 5th generation of Maimonidean Sufis, David ben Joshua
Maimonides, who wrote "Al-Mursid ila al-Tafarrud" (The Guide to Detachment),
which includes numerous extracts of Suhrawardi's "Kalimat at-Tasawwuf". Popular
culture. Films. In "The Jewel of the Nile" (1985), the eponymous Jewel is a
Sufi holy man. In "Hideous Kinky" (1998), Julia (Kate Winslet) travels to
Morocco to explore Sufism and a journey to self discovery. In "Monsieur
Ibrahim" (2003), Omar Sharif's character professes to be a Muslim in the Sufi
tradition. "Bab'Aziz" (2005), a film by Tunisian director Nacer Khemir, draws
heavily on the Sufi tradition, containing quotes from Sufi poets such as Rumi
and depicting an ecstatic Sufi dance. Music. A. R. Rahman, the Oscar-winning
Indian musician, has several compositions which draw inspiration from the Sufi
genre; examples are the filmi qawwalis "Khwaja Mere Khwaja" in the film "Jodhaa
Akbar", "Arziyan" in the film "Delhi 6" and "Kun Faya Kun" in the film
"Rockstar". Bengali singer Lalan Fakir and Bangladesh's national poet Kazi
Nazrul Islam scored several Sufi songs. Junoon, a band from Pakistan, created
the genre of Sufi rock by combining elements of modern hard rock and
traditional folk music with Sufi poetry. In 2005, Rabbi Shergill released a
Sufi rock song called "Bulla Ki Jaana", which became a chart-topper in India
and Pakistan. Madonna, on her 1994 record "Bedtime Stories", sings a song
called "Bedtime Story" that discusses achieving a high unconsciousness level.
The video for the song shows an ecstatic Sufi ritual with many dervishes
dancing, Arabic calligraphy and some other Sufi elements. In her 1998 song
"Bittersweet", she recites Rumi's poem by the same name. In her 2001 Drowned
World Tour, Madonna sang the song "Secret" showing rituals from many religions,
including a Sufi dance. Singer/songwriter Loreena McKennitt's record "The Mask
and Mirror" (1994) has a song called "The Mystic's Dream" that is influenced by
Sufi music and poetry. The band mewithoutYou has made references to Sufi
parables, including the name of their album "It's All Crazy! It's All False!
It's All a Dream! It's Alright" (2009). Tori Amos makes a reference to Sufis in
her song "Cruel". Mercan Dede is a Turkish composer who incorporates Sufism
into his music and performances. Literature. Rumi has become one of the most
widely read poets in the United States, thanks largely to the interpretative
translations published by Coleman Barks. Elif Shafak's novel "The Forty Rules
of Love" tell the story of the Persian poet Rumi becoming the disciple of the
Sufi dervish Shams Tabrizi.
