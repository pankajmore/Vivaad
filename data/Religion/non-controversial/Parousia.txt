Parousia Parousia (: ""; Greek: "Î Î±ÏÎ¿Ï…ÏƒÎ¯Î±") is an ancient Greek word
meaning presence, arrival, or official visit. Septuagint. The term occurs only
twice in the Septuagint (2 Maccabees 8:12 and 15:21) in its ordinary meaning of
arrival. New Testament. The word is used 24 times in the New Testament. Of
these, six uses refer to the coming of individuals: Stephanas, Fortunatus, and
Achaicus (1Co.16:17), Titus (2Co.7:6 & 7) the physical "presence" of Paul
himself (2Co.10:10, Php.1:26, 2:12), and a 7th use to the "coming of the
lawless one" (2Thess.2:9). The other seventeen uses refer to the Second Coming
of Christ, except the one case in which it refers to the coming of the "Day of
God" (2Pe.3:12, see also The Day of the Lord). The word parousia is found in
the following verses: Matthew 24:3, 27, 37, 39; 1 Corinthians 15:23; 1
Thessalonians 2:19; 3:13; 4:15; 5:23; 2 Thessalonians 2:1, 8, 9; James 5:7, 8;
2 Peter 1:16; 3:4, 12; 1 John 2:28. Theological usage. The main use in theology
is to refer to the second coming of Christ. However Karl Barth considered that
category of parousia includes Resurrection Sunday and the ActsÂ 2 Pentecost as
well, and therefore that the New Testament parousia is not limited to his final
return.
