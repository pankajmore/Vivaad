Papal infallibility Papal infallibility is a dogma of the Catholic Church which
states that, in virtue of the promise of Jesus to Peter, the Pope is preserved
from the possibility of error "when, in the exercise of his office as shepherd
and teacher of all Christians, in virtue of his supreme apostolic authority, he
defines a doctrine concerning faith or morals to be held by the whole Church".
This doctrine was defined dogmatically in the First Vatican Council of 1869-
1870. According to Catholic theology, there are several concepts important to
the understanding of infallible, divine revelation: Sacred Scripture, Sacred
Tradition, and the Sacred Magisterium. The infallible teachings of the Pope are
part of the Sacred Magisterium, which also consists of ecumenical councils and
the "ordinary and universal magisterium". In Catholic theology, papal
infallibility is one of the channels of the infallibility of the Church. The
infallible teachings of the Pope must be based on, or at least not contradict,
Sacred Tradition or Sacred Scripture. The doctrine of infallibility relies on
one of the cornerstones of Catholic dogma: that of petrine supremacy of the
pope, and his authority to be the ruling agent in deciding what will be
accepted as formal beliefs in the Roman Catholic Church. The clearest example
(though not the only one) of the use of this power, referred to as speaking "ex
cathedra" expressed since the solemn declaration of papal infallibility by
Vatican I on July 18, 1870, took place in 1950 when Pope Pius XII defined the
Assumption of Mary as being an article of faith for Roman Catholics. This
authority is considered by Catholics to be apostolic and of divine origin.
Prior to the solemn definition of 1870, Pope Boniface VIII in the Bull Unam
Sanctam of 1302, Pope Eugene IV in the Bull Cantate Domino of 1441, and Pope
Pius IX in the Papal constitution Ineffabilis Deus of 1854 have all spoken "ex
cathedra". Conditions for teachings being declared infallible. Statements by a
pope which exercise papal infallibility are referred to as "solemn papal
definitions" or "ex cathedra" teachings. Also considered infallible are the
teachings of the whole body of bishops of the Church, especially but not only
in an ecumenical council (see Infallibility of the Church). For a teaching by a
pope or ecumenical council to be recognized as infallible, the teaching must be
a decision of the supreme teaching authority of the Church (pope or College of
Bishops); it must concern a doctrine of faith or morals; it must bind the
universal Church; and it must be proposed as something to be held firmly and
immutably. The terminology of a definitive decree will usually make clear that
this last condition is fulfilled, as through a formula such as "By the
authority of Our Lord Jesus Christ and of the Blessed Apostles Peter and Paul,
and by Our own authority, We declare, pronounce and define the doctrine . . .
to be revealed by God and as such to be firmly and immutably held by all the
faithful", or through an accompanying anathema stating that anyone who
deliberately dissents is outside the Catholic Church. In July 2005 Pope
Benedict XVI stated during an impromptu address to priests in Aosta that: "The
Pope is not an oracle; he is infallible in very rare situations, as we know".
His predecessor Pope John XXIII once remarked: "I am only infallible if I speak
infallibly but I shall never do that, so I am not infallible". A doctrine
proposed by a pope as his own opinion, not solemnly proclaimed as a doctrine of
the Church, may be rejected as false, even if it is on a matter of faith and
morals, and even more any view he expresses on other matters. A well-known
example of a personal opinion on a matter of faith and morals that was taught
by a pope but rejected by the Church is the view that Pope John XXII expressed
on when the dead can reach the beatific vision. The limitation on the pope's
infallibility "on other matters" is frequently illustrated by Cardinal James
Gibbons's recounting how the pope mistakenly called him Jibbons. In general,
Catholic theologians hold that the canonizations of saints by a pope are
infallible teaching that the persons canonized are definitely in heaven with
God. "Ex cathedra". In connection with papal infallibility, the Latin phrase
"ex cathedra" (literally, "from the chair") has been defined as meaning "when,
in the exercise of his office as shepherd and teacher of all Christians, in
virtue of his supreme apostolic authority, (the Bishop of Rome) defines a
doctrine concerning faith or morals to be held by the whole Church". The
"chair" referred to is not a literal chair, but refers metaphorically to the
pope's position, or office, as the official teacher of Catholic doctrine: the
chair was the symbol of the teacher in the ancient worldâ€”the post of
university professor is still referred to as "the chair"â€”and bishops to this
day have a "cathedra", a seat or throne, as a symbol of their teaching and
governing authority. The pope is said to occupy the "chair of Peter", as
Catholics hold that among the apostles Peter had a special role as the
preserver of unity, so the pope as successor of Peter holds the role of
spokesman for the whole church among the bishops, the successors as a group of
the apostles. (Also see Holy See and sede vacante: both terms evoke this seat
or throne.) The response demanded from believers has been characterized as
"assent" in the case of "ex cathedra" declarations of the popes and "due
respect" with regard to their other declarations. Scripture and primacy of
Peter. On the basis of , , and , the Catechism of the Catholic Church describes
Peter as holding first place among the apostles. It speaks of Peter as the rock
on which, because of Peter's faith, Christ said in he would build his Church,
which he declared would be victorious over the powers of death. In , Jesus gave
Peter the mission to keep his faith after every lapse and to strengthen his
brothers in it. The Catechism of the Catholic Church sees the power of the keys
that Jesus promised to Peter alone in as signifying authority to govern the
house of God, that is, the Church, an authority that Jesus after his
resurrection confirmed for Peter by instructing him in to feed Christ's sheep.
The power to bind and loose, conferred on all the apostles jointly and to Peter
in particular (Matthew 16:19) is seen in the Catechism of the Catholic Church
as authority to absolve sins, to pronounce judgments on doctrine and to make
decisions on Church discipline. Primacy of the Roman pontiff. Doctrine-based
religions evolve their theologies over time, and Catholicism is no exception:
its theology did not spring instantly and fully formed within the bosom of the
earliest Church. Pope St. Clement of Rome, c. 99, stated in a letter to the
Corinthians: "Indeed you will give joy and gladness to us, if having become
obedient to what we have written through the Holy Spirit, you will "cut out the
unlawful application of your zeal" according to the exhortation which we have
made in this epistle concerning peace and union" (Denziger Â§41, emphasis
added). St. Clement of Alexandria wrote on the primacy of Peter c. 200: "...the
blessed Peter, the chosen, the pre-eminent, the first among the disciples, for
whom alone with Himself the Savior paid the tribute"... (Jurgens Â§436). The
existence of an ecclesiastical hierarchy is emphasized by St. Stephan I, 251,
in a letter to the bishop of Antioch: "Therefore did not that famous defender
of the Gospel know that there ought to be one bishop in the Catholic Church [of
the city of Rome? It did not lie hidden from him"... (Denziger Â§45). St.
Julius I, in 341 wrote to the Antiochenes: "Or do you not know that it is the
custom to write to us first, and "that here what is just is decided"?"
(Denziger Â§57a, emphasis added). Catholicism holds that an understanding among
the apostles was written down in what became the scriptures, and rapidly became
the living custom of the Church, and that from there, a clearer theology could
unfold. St. Siricius wrote to Himerius in 385: "To your inquiry we do not deny
a legal reply, because we, upon whom greater zeal for the Christian religion is
incumbent than upon the whole body, out of consideration for our office do not
have the liberty to dissimulate, nor to remain silent. We carry the weight of
all who are burdened; nay rather the blessed apostle PETER bears these in us,
who, as we trust, protects us in all matters of his administration, and guards
his heirs" (Denziger Â§87, emphasis in original). Many of the Church Fathers
spoke of ecumenical councils and the Bishop of Rome as possessing a reliable
authority to teach the content of scripture and tradition, albeit without a
divine guarantee of protection from error. Theological history. Klaus Schatz
asserts that "it is impossible to fix a single author or era as the starting
point" for the doctrine of papal infallibility. Others such as Brian Tierney
have argued that the doctrine of papal infallibility was first proposed by
Peter Olivi in the Middle Ages. Schatz and others see the roots of the doctrine
as going much further back to the early days of Christianity. Brian Tierney
argued that the Franciscan priest Peter Olivi was the first person to attribute
infallibility to the pope. His idea was accepted by August Bernhard Hasler, and
by Gregory Lee Jackson, It was rejected by James Heft, and by John V. Kruse.
Klaus Schatz says Olivi by no means played the key role assigned to him by
Tierney, who failed to acknowledge the work of earlier canonists and
theologians, and that the crucial advance in the teaching came only in the 15th
century, two centuries after Olivi; and he declares that "it is impossible to
fix a single author or era as the starting point". Ulrich Horst criticized the
Tierney view for the same reasons. In his Protestant evaluation of the
ecumenical issue of papal infallibility, Mark E. Powell rejects Tierney's
theory about 13th-century Olivi, saying that the doctrine of papal
infallibility defined at Vatican I had its origins in the 14th centuryâ€”he
refers in particular to Bishop Guido Terreniâ€”and was itself part of a long
development of papal claims. Schatz points to "the special esteem given to the
Roman church community (that) was always associated with fidelity in the faith
and preservation of the paradosis (the faith as handed down)". Schatz
differentiates between the later doctrine of "infallibility of the papal
magisterium" and the Hormisdas formula in 519 which asserted that "the Roman
church has never erred (and will never err)". He emphasizes that Hormisdas
formula was not meant to apply so much to "individual dogmatic definitions but
to the whole of the faith as handed down and the tradition of Peter preserved
intact by the Roman Church". Specifically, Schatz argues that the Hormisdas
formula does not exclude the possibility of individual popes become heretics
because the formula refers "primarily to the Roman tradition as such and not
exclusively to the person of the pope". Ecumenical councils. The 12th-century
Decretum Gratiani contained the declaration by Pope Gregory I (590-604) that
the first four ecumenical councils were to be revered "like the four gospels",
because they had been "established by universal consent", and also Gratian's
assertion that "the holy Roman Church imparts authority to the sacred canons
but is not bound by them". Commentators on the Decretum, known as the
Decretists, generally concluded that a pope could change the disciplinary
decrees of the ecumenical councils but was bound by their pronouncements on
articles of faith, in which field the authority of a general council was higher
than that of an individual pope. Unlike those who propounded the 15th-century
conciliarist theories, they understood an ecumenical council as necessarily
involving the pope, and meant that the pope plus the other bishops was greater
than a pope acting alone. Middle Ages. Several medieval theologians discussed
the infallibility of the pope when defining matters of faith and morals,
including Thomas Aquinas. The Dictatus papae have been attributed to Pope
Gregory VII (1073-1085) in the year 1075, but some have argued that they are
later than 1087. They assert that no one can judge the pope (Proposition 19)
and that "the Roman church has never erred; nor will it err to all eternity,
the Scripture bearing witness" (Proposition 22). This is seen as a further step
in advancing the idea that "had been part of church history and debate as far
back as 519 when the notion of the Bishop of Rome as the preserver of apostolic
truth was set forth in the Formula of Hormisdas". In the early years of the
14th century, the Franciscan Order found itself in open conflict about the form
of poverty to be observed, with the Spirituals (so called because associated
with the Age of the Spirit that Joachim of Fiore had said would begin in 1260)
pitched against the Conventual Franciscans. The Spirituals, who in the 13th
century were led by the Joachimist Peter Olivi, adopted extremist positions
that eventually discredited the notion of apostolic poverty and led to its
condemnation by Pope John XXII. This pope determined to suppress what he
considered to be the excesses of the Spirituals, who contended eagerly for the
view that Christ and his apostles had possessed absolutely nothing, either
separately or jointly In March 1322, he commissioned experts to examine the
idea of poverty based on belief that Christ and the apostles owned nothing. The
experts disagreed among themselves, but the majority condemned the idea on the
grounds that it would condemn the Church's right to have possessions. The
Franciscan chapter held in Perugia in May 1322 declared on the contrary: "To
say or assert that Christ, in showing the way of perfection, and the Apostles,
in following that way and setting an example to others who wished to lead the
perfect life, possessed nothing either severally or in common, either by right
of ownership and "dominium" or by personal right, we corporately and
unanimously declare to be not heretical, but true and catholic". One argument
used by them was that John XXII's predecessors had declared the absolute
poverty of Christ to be an article of faith and that therefore no pope could
declare the contrary. Appeal was made in particular to the 14 August 1279 bull
"Exiit qui seminat", in which Pope Nicholas III stated that renunciation of
ownership of all things "both individually but also in common, for God's sake,
is meritorious and holy; Christ, also, showing the way of perfection, taught it
by word and confirmed it by example, and the first founders of the Church
militant, as they had drawn it from the fountainhead itself, distributed it
through the channels of their teaching and life to those wishing to live
perfectly". By the bull "Ad conditorem canonum" of 8 December of the same year,
John XXII, declaring it ridiculous to pretend that every scrap of food given to
the friars and eaten by them belonged to the pope, forced them to accept
ownership by ending the arrangement according to which all property given to
the Franciscans was vested in the Holy See, which granted the friars the mere
use of it. He thus demolished the fictitious structure that gave the appearance
of absolute poverty to the life of the Franciscan friars, a structure that
"absolved the Franciscans from the moral burden of legal ownership, and enabled
them to practise apostolic poverty without the inconvenience of actual
poverty". This document was concerned with disciplinary rather than doctrinal
matters, but leaders of the Franciscans reacted with insistence on the
irreformability of doctrinal papal decrees, with special reference to "Exiit".
A year later, John XXII issued the short 12 November 1323 bull "Cum inter
nonnullos", which declared "erroneous and heretical" the doctrine that Christ
and his apostles had no possessions whatever. The next year, the Pope responded
to continued criticisms with the bull "Quia quorundam" of 10 November 1324, He
denied the major premise of an argument of his adversaries, "What the Roman
pontiffs have once defined in faith and morals with the key of knowledge stands
so immutably that it is not permitted to a successor to revoke it". He declared
that there was no contradiction between his own statements and those of his
predecessors; that it could not be inferred from the words of the 1279 bull
that Christ and the apostles had nothing: "indeed, it can be inferred rather
that the Gospel life lived by Christ and the Apostles did not exclude some
possessions in common, since living 'without property' does not require that
those living thus should have nothing in common"; that there were many things
in the Franciscan rule "which Christ neither taught nor confirmed by his
example", and that there was neither merit nor truth in pretending Christ and
the apostles had no rights in law. In his book on the First Vatican Council,
August Hasler wrote: "John XXII didn't want to hear about his own
infallibility. He viewed it as an improper restriction of his rights as a
sovereign, and in the bull "Qui quorundam" (1324) condemned the Franciscan
doctrine of papal infallibility as the work of the devil". "Pope John XXII
strongly resented the imputation of infallibility to his officeÂ â€“ or at any
rate to his predecessors. The theory of irreformability proposed by his
adversaries was a 'pestiferous doctrine', he declared; and at first he seemed
inclined to dismiss the whole idea as 'pernicious audacity'. However, through
some uncharacteristic streak of caution or through sheer good luck (or bad
luck) the actual terms he used in condemning the Franciscan position left a way
open for later theologians to re-formulate the doctrine of infallibility in
different language". In 1330, the Carmelite bishop Guido Terreni described the
pope's charism of infallibility in terms very similar to those that the First
Vatican Council was to use in 1870. Dogmatic definition of 1870. According to
Catholic theology, this is an infallible dogmatic definition by an ecumenical
council. Because the 1870 definition is not seen by Catholics as a creation of
the Church, but as the dogmatic revelation of a truth about the papal
magisterium, papal teachings made prior to the 1870 proclamation can, if they
meet the criteria set out in the dogmatic definition, be considered infallible.
"Ineffabilis Deus" is an example of this. A British Prime Minister, William
Ewart Gladstone, publicly attacked Vatican I, stating that Roman Catholics had
"forfeited their moral and mental freedom". He published a pamphlet called "The
Vatican Decrees in their Bearing on Civil Allegiance" in which he described the
Catholic Church as "an Asian monarchy: nothing but one giddy height of
despotism, and one dead level of religious subservience". He further claimed
that the Pope wanted to destroy the rule of law and replace it with arbitrary
tyranny, and then to hide these "crimes against liberty beneath a suffocating
cloud of incense". Cardinal Newman famously responded with his "Letter to the
Duke of Norfolk". In the letter he argues that conscience, which is supreme, is
not in conflict with papal infallibilityâ€”though he toasts "I shall drink to
the Pope if you please--still, to conscience first and to the Pope afterwards".
He stated later that "the Vatican Council left the Pope just as it found him",
satisfied that the definition was very moderate, and specific in regards to
what specifically can be declared as infallible Instances of infallible
declarations. The Catholic Church does not teach that the pope is infallible in
everything he says; official invocation of papal infallibility is extremely
rare. Catholic theologians agree that both Pope Pius IX's 1854 definition of
the dogma of the Immaculate Conception of Mary and Pope Pius XII's 1950
definition of the dogma of the Assumption of Mary are instances of papal
infallibility, a fact which has been confirmed by the Church's magisterium.
However, theologians disagree about what other documents qualify. The Holy See
has given no complete list of papal statements considered to be infallible. A
1998 commentary on "Ad Tuendam Fidem" issued by the Congregation for the
Doctrine of the Faith published on "L'Osservatore Romano" in July 1998 listed a
number of instances of infallible pronouncements by popes and by ecumenical
councils, but explicitly stated (at no. 11) that this was not meant to be a
complete list. One of the documents mentioned is Pope John Paul II's apostolic
letter "Ordinatio Sacerdotalis" on reserving priestly ordination to men alone,
which the Congregation earlier stated to be infallible, although not taught "ex
cathedra" (i.e., although not a teaching of the extraordinary magisterium),
clarifying that the content of this letter has been taught infallibly by the
ordinary and universal magisterium. This was confirmed in a commentary by the
same Congregation and in commentaries by Cardinals Joseph Ratzinger and
Tarcisio Bertone. As well as popes, ecumenical councils have made
pronouncements that the Church considers infallible. Denial by Catholics. Ideas
of papal infallibility broader than that defined as dogma by the First Vatican
Council have been explicitly denied even by popes. Thus the claim of
infallibility advanced by Franciscan Spirituals in the 14th century, and which
has been attributed also to 13th-century Peter Olivi, with regard to a
statement by Pope Nicholas III was rejected by Pope John XXII. The terms in
which John XXII condemned the position of the Franciscan Spirituals "left a way
open for later theologians to re-formulate the doctrine of infallibility in
different language", as Guido Terreni, a member of Pope John XXII's court, did
in 1330 in terms "closer to the nineteenth century doctrine of papal
infallibility than any that had been developed earlier" and closely
anticipating the doctrine of the First Vatican Council. Examples of Catholics
who before the First Vatican Council disbelieved in papal infallibility are
French abbÃ© FranÃ§ois-Philippe Mesenguy (1677-1763), who wrote a catechism
denying the infallibility of the pope, and the German Felix Blau (1754-1798),
who as professor at the University of Mainz criticized infallibility. In 1822,
Bishop Baine declared: "In England and Ireland I do not believe that any
Catholic maintains the Infallibility of the Pope". A 1989-1992 survey of young
people of the 15 to 25 age group (81% of whom were Catholics, 84% were younger
than 19, and 62% were male) chiefly from the United States, but also from
Austria, Canada, Ecuador, France, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Peru, Spain and
Switzerland, found that 36.9% affirmed that "the Pope has the authority to
speak with infallibility", 36.9% (exactly the same proportion) denied it, and
26.2% said they didn't know. In addition, before 1870 belief in papal
infallibility was not a defined requirement of Catholic faith. The Church
therefore accepted the oath required of Catholics in Ireland from 1793 for
admittance to certain positions and which stated that "it is not an article of
the Catholic Faith, neither am I thereby required to believe or profess that
the Pope is infallible" The Irish bishops repeated their acceptance in a 25
January 1826 pastoral address to the Catholic clergy and laity in Ireland,
stating: "The Catholics of Ireland not only do not believe, but they declare
upon oath ... that it is not an article of the Catholic faith, neither are they
required to believe, that the Pope is infallible, and that they do not hold
themselves 'bound to obey any order in its own nature immoral', though the Pope
or any ecclesiastical power should issue or direct such an order; but, on the
contrary, that it would be sinful in them to pay any respect or obedience
thereto". Sparrow-Simpson remarked that "all works reprinted since 1870 have
been altered into conformity with Vatican ideas. In some cases the process of
reducing to conformity was begun at an earlier date. It is therefore with works
printed before 1870 that we are now concerned". He therefore cites editions
prior to that date. In his theological works published in 1829, Professor
Delahogue asserted that the doctrine that the Roman Pontiff, even when he
speaks "ex cathedra", is possessed of the gift of inerrancy or is superior to
General Councils may be denied without loss of faith or risk of heresy or
schism. In his 1829 study "On the Church", Delahogue stated: "Ultramontane
theologians attribute infallibility to the Bishop of Rome considered in this
aspect and when he speaks, as the saying is, "ex cathedra". This is denied by
others, in particular by Gallicans". The 1830 edition of Berrington and Kirk's
"Faith of Catholics" stated: "Papal definitions or decrees, in whatever form
pronounced, taken exclusively from a General Council or acceptance of the
Church, oblige no one under pain of heresy to an interior assent". In 1861,
Professor Murray of the major Irish Catholic seminary of Maynooth wrote that
those who genuinely deny the infallibility of the pope "are by no means or only
in the least degree (unless indeed some other ground be shown) to be considered
alien from the Catholic Faith". Critical works such as "Roman Catholic
Opposition to Papal Infallibility" (1909) by W. J. Sparrow-Simpson have thus
documented opposition to the definition of the dogma during the First Vatican
Council even by those who believed in its teaching but felt that defining it
was not opportune. Following the 1869-1870 First Vatican Council, dissent arose
among a few Catholics, almost exclusively German, Austrian, and Swiss, over the
definition of papal infallibility. The dissenters, while holding the General
Councils of the Church infallible, were unwilling to accept the dogma of papal
infallibility, and thus a schism arose between them and the Church, resulting
in the formation of communities in schism with Rome, which became known as the
Old Catholic Churches. The vast majority of Catholics accepted the definition.
Before the First Vatican Council, John Henry Newman, while personally
convinced, as a matter of theological opinion, of papal infallibility, opposed
its definition as dogma, fearing that the definition might be expressed in
over-broad terms open to misunderstanding. He was pleased with the moderate
tone of the actual definition, which "affirmed the pope's infallibility only
within a strictly limited province: the doctrine of faith and morals initially
given to the apostolic Church and handed down in Scripture and tradition". A
few present-day Catholics, such as Hans KÃ¼ng, author of "Infallible? An
Inquiry", and historian Garry Wills, author of "Papal Sin", refuse to accept
papal infallibility as a matter of faith. KÃ¼ng has been sanctioned by the
Church by being excluded from teaching Catholic theology. Brian Tierney agrees
with KÃ¼ng, whom he cites, and concludes: "There is no convincing evidence that
papal infallibility formed any part of the theological or canonical tradition
of the church before the thirteenth century; the doctrine was invented in the
first place by a few dissident Franciscans because it suited their convenience
to invent it; eventually, but only after much initial reluctance, it was
accepted by the papacy because it suited the convenience of the popes to accept
it". Garth Hallett, "drawing on a previous study of Wittgenstein's treatment of
word meaning", argued that the dogma of infallibility is neither true nor false
but meaningless; in practice, he claims, the dogma seems to have no practical
use and to have succumbed to the sense that it is irrelevant. Mark E. Powell,
in his examination of the topic from a Protestant point of view, writes:
"August Hasler portrays Pius IX as an uneducated, abusive megalomaniac, and
Vatican I as a council that was not free. Hasler, though, is engaged in heated
polemic and obviously exaggerates his picture of Pius IX. Accounts like
Hasler's, which paint Pius IX and Vatican I in the most negative terms, are
adequately refuted by the testimony of participants at Vatican I". Objections.
Those opposed to papal infallibility such as Geisler and MacKenzie say that it
is contrary to Scripture and to the teaching of the early Church. Positions of
some other churches. Eastern Orthodoxy. The dogma of papal infallibility is
rejected by Eastern Orthodoxy. Orthodox Christians hold that the Holy Spirit
will not allow the whole Body of Orthodox Christians to fall into error but
leave open the question of how this will be ensured in any specific case.
Eastern Orthodoxy considers that the first seven ecumenical councils were
infallible as accurate witnesses to the truth of the gospel, not so much on
account of their institutional structure as on account of their reception by
the Christian faithful. Furthermore, Orthodox Christians do not believe that
any individual bishop is infallible or that the idea of papal infallibility was
taught during the first centuries of Christianity. Orthodox historians often
point to the condemnation of Pope Honorius I as a heretic by the Sixth
Ecumenical council as a significant indication. However, it is debated whether
Honorius' letter to Sergius met (in retrospect) the criteria set forth at
Vatican I. Other Orthodox scholars argue that past papal statements that appear
to meet the conditions set forth at Vatican I for infallible status presented
teachings in faith and morals are now acknowledged as problematic. Evangelical
churches. Evangelical churches do not believe in papal infallibility for
reasons similar to Methodist and Reformed Christians. Evangelicals believe that
the Bible alone is infallible or inerrant. Most evangelical churches and
ministries have statements of doctrine that explicitly say that the Bible,
composed of the Hebrew Scriptures and the New Testament, is the sole rule for
faith and practice. Most of these statements, however, are articles of faith
that evangelicals affirm in a positive way, and contain no reference to the
papacy or other beliefs that are not part of evangelical doctrine. Claim that
Vatican I was to dogmatize papal temporal power. However, following the Austro-
Prussian War, Austria had recognized the Kingdom of Italy. Consequently,
because of this and other substantial political changes: "The "CiviltÃ 
Cattolica" suggested that the papal infallibility should be substituted for the
dogma of temporal power "... Moritz Busch's "Bismarck: Some secret pages of his
history", Vol. II, Macmillan (1898) contains the following entry for 3 March
1872 in pp.Â 43â€“44.
