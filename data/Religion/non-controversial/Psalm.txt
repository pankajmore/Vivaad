Psalms The Book of Psalms (Tiberian: "T…ôhill√Æm"; Modern: "Tehillim",
◊™÷∞◊î÷¥◊ú÷¥÷º◊ô◊ù, or "praises"), commonly referred to simply as Psalms, is a
book of the Hebrew Bible, the Christian Bible, and the Islamic Zabur. Taken
together, its 150 poems "express virtually the full range of Israel's religious
faith." Etymology. The word "psalms" is derived from the Greek "Œ®Œ±ŒªŒºŒøŒØ"
("Psalmoi"), perhaps originally meaning "music of the lyre" or "songs sung to a
harp" and then to any piece of music. From "psallein" "play upon a stringed
instrument" and then to "make music in any fashion". Composition and numbering.
The Book of Psalms in its current, most commonly used form consists of 150
songs and prayers referred to individually as psalms and referenced by chapter
and verse. They each have a poetic character with frequent use of parallelism.
In addition to the title of the collection, which translates as "song" or
"hymns" from both Hebrew and Greek, superscriptions (or headings) in many of
the Psalms provide musical references and some direction, in some cases even
references to melodies that, anciently, would have been well-known; however, no
musical notation has survived. Songs that can be identified as such in the
Psalms include songs of thanksgiving (e.g., Ps 30), hymns of praise (e.g., Ps
117) and royal psalms, which may have been used in coronations and weddings.
Identification of some psalms as prayers is also seen within the text, for
example in the conclusion to Psalm 72, "The prayers of David son of Jesse are
ended." The largest category of Psalms, though not grouped as such in the text,
is that of lament (expressions of complaint and pleas for help from God). There
appears to also have been an instructional function of the psalms as seen in
their references to the law (e.g., Ps 1 and 119). Dating of individual
compositions is difficult, and in some cases impossible. Many appear to have
been written early in the history of ancient Israel (first millennium BC or
even earlier), while others may have been written after the exile to Babylon,
which occurred in the sixth century BC. Biblical scholars note the early
organization into five collections, paralleling the Torah or Pentateuch (the
first 5 books of the Bible). However, other reasons for dividing the book in
this way are unclear. Authorship is also uncertain in spite of frequent
attributions to David. Numbering. "For the remainder of this article the Hebrew
numbering is used, unless otherwise noted." Other psalms. Most manuscripts of
the Septuagint also include a Psalm 151, present in Eastern Orthodox
translations; a Hebrew version of this poem was found in the "Psalms Scroll" of
the Dead Sea Scrolls. The Psalms Scroll presents the Psalms in an order
different from that found elsewhere, and also contains a number of non-
canonical poems and hymns in the same style as the canonical Psalms, suggesting
that the current collection of 150 may have been selected from a wider set.
Some versions of the Peshitta also include Psalms 152‚Äì155. There are also the
Psalms of Solomon, which are 18 psalms of Jewish origin ‚Äî likely originally
written in Hebrew, but only surviving in Greek and Syriac translation. They are
not accepted as canonical by any major contemporary Jewish or Christian group.
Authorship and ascriptions. In various biblical passages, David is referred to
as ‚Äúthe favorite of the songs of Israel,‚Äù the one who soothed Saul with
music, and the founder of Temple singing. A Psalms scroll from the Dead Sea
Scrolls (11QPsa) attributes 3600 tehilim (songs of praise) plus other
compositions to David. Seventy-three of the 150 Psalms in the Bible are
attributed to David. The supreme kingship of Yahweh is the most pervasive
theological concept in the book of Psalms, and many psalms attributed to David
are directed to Yahweh by name, whether in praise or petition, suggesting a
relationship. According to the Midrash Tehillim, King David was prompted to the
Psalms by the Holy Spirit that rested upon him. In addition to ascribing
authorship to David, several Psalms are identified with specific events in
David‚Äôs life. Psalm 34 is attributed to David on the occasion of his escape
from the Abimelech (king) Achish by pretending to be insane. According to the
narrative in 1 Samuel 21, instead of killing the man who had exacted so many
casualties from him, Abimelech allows David to depart, exclaiming, ‚ÄúAm I so
short of madmen that you have to bring this fellow here to carry on like this
in front of me? Must this man come into my house?" Psalm 34 is one of seven
acrostic Psalms in the original Hebrew; most English translations do not retain
the acrostic form. The first part of Psalm 34 is directed toward Yahweh in
complete and humble gratitude (David does not even mention his own royal
status); the second part confidently directs others to Yahweh. In contrast,
Psalm 18 is not related to a specific incident but rather to God‚Äôs faithful
deliverance from ‚Äúall of his enemies and from the hand of Saul.‚Äù The text
of this Psalm was thought to date to the 10th century BC even before the
discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls and is very similar to that of 2 Samuel 22.
In this Psalm, David recalls being in deadly situations: ‚ÄúThe cords of death
entangled me, the torrents of destruction overwhelmed me.‚Äù He cries out to
God for help, and God rescues David. The Scottish theologian Samuel Rutherford
(1600‚Äì1661) notes that crying out to God is mentioned in many Psalms
attributed to David. He comments, ‚ÄúFervour is a heavenly ingredient in
prayer. An arrow drawn with full strength hath a speedier issue.‚Äù The Midrash
Tehillim teaches from Psalm 4 ‚Äúthat the mere mechanical application to the
Throne of Mercy is not efficacious is plainly seen from the words of King
David, who says God is nigh to all that call upon Him, and ‚Ä¶ he adds the
important words, 'to those who call upon Him "in truth".'‚Äù Jewish tradition,
recorded in the Talmud, posits that the Psalms are the work of David (seventy-
three Psalms are with David's name), based on the writings of ten ancient
psalmists (including Adam and Moses). In the New Testament, six of the Psalms
(2, 16, 32, 69, 95, and 110) are specifically identified as the work of David
(in, respectively, Acts 4:25; Acts 2:31; Rom. 4:6; Rom. 11:9; Heb. 4:7; and
Matt. 22:43 and corresponding verses in the other Synoptic Gospels, as well as
Acts 2:34). Many modern scholars see them as the product of several authors or
groups of authors, many unknown. The majority of Psalms are prefixed with
introductory words‚Äî"superscriptions", which are frequently different in the
Masoretic and Septuagint traditions, or missing in one while present in the
other. In the Masoretic text, 101 bear in the headings the name of a specific
person or group; 73 of these refer to David. The ascription to David usually
takes the form ◊ú◊ì◊ï◊ì, with the preposition "le-" attached to David's name.
This can mean "of," "by," "for," or "concerning". Hence, while the traditional
interpretation is that these Psalms were written by David, Michael Goulder
argues that the psalms were written in David's lifetime, probably by one of his
sons, "in response to situations in which he found himself." Additionally,
thirteen Psalms have headings that refer to some event in the life of David.
These Psalms are 3, 7, 18, 34, 51, 52, 54, 56, 57, 59, 60, 63 and 142. Other
scholars think the Psalms is a post-Exilic collection of poems, the work of
several authors from differing dates. These scholars assert that many of the
Psalms could have been composed as early as the Monarchy, when they honored
successions of Davidic kings. The early poems may have been used in worship at
the temple. Psalms 39, 62, and 77 are linked with Jeduthun, to be sung after
his manner or in his choir. Psalms 50 and 73‚Äì83 are the Psalms of Asaph,
associated with Asaph, as the master of his choir, to be sung in the worship of
God. The ascriptions of Psalms 42, 44‚Äì49, 84, 85, 87, and 88 assert that the
"sons of Korah" were entrusted with arranging and singing them; suggests that
this group formed a leading part of the Korathite singers. Hebraist Joel M.
Hoffman suggests that Psalm 49 may be an anti-corruption Psalm, not "for Korah"
but "against Korah." Psalm 18 is also found, with minor variations, at , for
which reason, in accordance with the naming convention used elsewhere in the
historic parts of the Bible, it is known as the "Song of David". Portions of
Psalms 105, 96, and possibly 106 appear in under the ambiguous heading (in the
Douay translation), "In that day David made Asaph the chief to give praise to
the Lord with his brethren." Benjamin Urrutia wrote a brief article on the
Egyptian religious ritual of the Opening of the Mouth. In it, he traces common
themes between the Opening of the Mouth and Psalm 51, such as opening the mouth
(or of the lips, in Psalm 51), healing of broken bones, and washing the inner
organs with special cleansing spices. Muslim tradition maintains that the
Psalms, known as Zabur in the Quran, were revealed to David by God in the same
way that the Torah was revealed to Moses and the Quran to Muhammad. Sections of
the book. Psalm 136 is generally called "the great Hallel", but the Talmud also
includes Psalms 120‚Äì135. Psalms 113‚Äì118 constitute the Hallel, which is
recited on the three great feasts, (Passover, Weeks, and Tabernacles); at the
new moon; and on the eight days of Hanukkah. A version of Psalm 136 with
slightly different wording appears in the Dead Sea Scrolls. Psalms 120‚Äì134
are referred to as Songs of Ascents, and are thought to have been used as hymns
of approach by pilgrims to the Temple in Jerusalem. Psalm 119 is the longest
Psalm. It is composed of 176 verses, in sets of eight verses, each set
beginning with one of the 22 Hebrew letters. Several other Psalms also have
alphabetical arrangements. These psalms are believed to be written (rather than
oral) compositions from the first, and thus of a relatively late date. Psalm
117 is the shortest Psalm, containing only two verses. Psalm forms. Hymn genre.
Generally these psalms consist of praise and can be subdivided into 1)¬ Hymns
of Divine Kingship (e.g. Psalm 29), 2)¬ Creation Hymns (e.g. Psalm 104), and
3)¬ Hymns celebrating divine action in Israel's history (e.g. Psalm 105 and
106). These psalms describe the relationship between the Israelite people and
God and recognizes his power and majesty, a theme that is found in other wisdom
literature. Gunkel also described a special subset of Eschatological Hymns
which includes themes of future restoration (Psalm 126) or of judgment (Psalm
82). Lament genre. The Lament/Complaint Psalms can be subdivided into two
categories 1) the individual and 2) communal lament. Both types of laments
typically but did not always include the following elements nor is there a
systematic order in which they appear in body of the Lament Psalm; 1) an
address to God, 2) A description of suffering, 3) Cursing of the party
responsible for suffering, 4) Protestation of innocence or admission of guilt,
5) A petition for divine assistance, 6) Faith in God's receipt of prayer, 7)
Anticipation of divine response, and 8) A song of thanksgiving. In general, the
difference between the individual and communal subtypes can be distinguished by
the use of the singular "I" or the plural "we". However, the "I" could also be
characterizing an individual's personal experience that was reflective of the
entire community. Orientation, Disorientation, Reorientation. Parallelism. The
biblical poetry of Psalms uses parallelism as their primary poetic device.
Parallelism is a kind of rhyme, in which an idea is developed by the use of
repetition, synonyms, or opposites. Synonymous parallelism involves two lines
expressing essentially the same idea. An example of synonymous parallelism: Use
of the Psalms in Jewish ritual. In the Pentateuch (or Torah), Moses leads the
Jews in two songs of praise: upon the splitting of the Red Sea (Exodus 15),
with his sister Miriam, and before his death (Deuteronomy 32). Also, the Jews
sing upon miracles done for them with the well (Numbers 21). Other Jewish
figures would sing songs to celebrate miracles, including Joshua and Deborah.
It is David, though, who is known as the "sweet singer of Israel". In Jewish
tradition, the Psalms were actually sung in front of the Tabernacle, and then
later during the reign of King Solomon, when the Temple was completed, they
were sung from the steps of the Temple. The singers all came from the tribe of
Levi (Levites), and it was exclusively their privilege ‚Äì no non-Levites were
allowed to sing in that area of the Temple. Levites played musical
accompaniment on various instruments, some mentioned within the Psalms
themselves. While the Psalms are used extensively in worship and prayer, the
original intent was as a vehicle to teach, explain, encourage, and communicate
with the individual listener as well as the entire people, hence their public
performance. Today we have some knowledge as to which Psalms were sung on
specific days or occasions, but we do not know the entire schedule. Psalms are
used throughout traditional Jewish worship. Many complete Psalms and verses
from Psalms appear in the morning services ("Shacharit"). The "pesukei dezimra"
component incorporates Psalms 30, 100 and 145 - 150. Psalm 145 (commonly
referred to as "Ashrei", which is really the first word of 2 verses appended to
the beginning of the Psalm), is read three times every day: once in shacharit
as part of "pesukei dezimrah", as mentioned, once, along with Psalm 20, as part
of the morning's concluding prayers, and once at the start of the Afternoon
service. On Festival days and Sabbaths, instead of concluding the morning
service, it precedes the Mussaf service. Psalms 95‚Äì99, 29, 92, and 93, along
with some later readings, comprise the introduction ("Kabbalat Shabbat") to the
Friday night service. Traditionally, a different "Psalm for the Day" - "Shir
shel yom" - is read after the morning service each day of the week (starting
Sunday, Psalms: 24, 48, 82, 94, 81, 93, 92). This is described in the Mishnah
(the initial codification of the Jewish oral tradition) in the tractate
"Tamid". According to the Talmud, these daily Psalms were originally recited on
that day of the week by the Levites in the Temple in Jerusalem. From Rosh
Chodesh Elul until Hoshanah Rabbah, Psalm 27 is recited twice daily following
the morning and evening services. There is a "Minhag" (custom) to say Psalm 30
each morning of Chanukkah after Shacharit: some say this ‚Äúinstead‚Äù of the
regular "Psalm for the Day", others say this additionally. When a Jew dies, a
watch is kept over the body and Tehillim (Psalms) are recited constantly by sun
or candlelight, until the burial service. Historically, this watch would be
carried out by the immediate family ‚Äì usually in shifts ‚Äì but in
contemporary practice, this service is provided by an employee of the funeral
home or Chevra kadisha. Many Jews complete the Book of Psalms on a weekly or
monthly basis. Each week, some also say a Psalm connected to that week's events
or the Torah portion read during that week. In addition, many Jews (notably
Lubavitch, and other Chasidim) read the entire Book of Psalms prior to the
morning service, on the Sabbath preceding the calculated appearance of the new
moon. The reading of psalms is viewed in Jewish tradition as a vehicle for
gaining God's favor. They are thus often specially recited in times of trouble,
such as poverty, disease, or physical danger; in many synagogues, Psalms are
recited after services for the security of the State of Israel. Note that Sefer
ha-Chinuch states that this practice is designed not to achieve favor, as such,
but rather to inculcate belief in Divine Providence into one's consciousness
‚Äì as consistent with Maimonides' general view on Providence. (Relatedly, the
Hebrew verb for prayer ‚Äì "hitpalal" ◊î◊™◊§◊ú◊ú ‚Äì is in fact the reflexive
form of "palal" ◊§◊ú◊ú, to judge. Thus, "to pray" conveys the notion of
"judging oneself": ultimately, the purpose of prayer ‚Äì "tefilah" ◊™◊§◊ú◊î ‚Äì
is to transform ourselves; for the relationship between prayer and psalms ‚Äì
""tehillah" and "tefillah"" ‚Äì see S. R. Hirsch, "Horeb" ¬ß620. See also under
Jewish services.) Psalms may also be read by a group of people who divide up
the psalms between them to allow for a complete reading of the book. The 116
direct quotations from the Psalms in the New Testament show that they were
familiar to the Judean community in the first century of the Christian era.
Taken together, the Psalms express virtually the full range of Israel's faith.
The Psalms in Christian worship. New Testament references show that the
earliest Christians used the Psalms in worship, and the Psalms have remained an
important part of worship in most Christian Churches. The Eastern Orthodox,
Catholic, Presbyterian, Lutheran and Anglican Churches have always made
systematic use of the Psalms, with a cycle for the recitation of all or most of
them over the course of one or more weeks. In the early centuries of the
Church, it was expected that any candidate for bishop would be able to recite
the entire Psalter from memory, something they often learned automatically
during their time as monks. Paul the Apostle quotes psalms (specifically Psalms
14 and 53, which are nearly identical) as the basis for his theory of original
sin, and includes the scripture in the Epistle to the Romans, chapter 3.
Several conservative Protestant denominations sing only the Psalms (some
churches also sing the small number of hymns found elsewhere in the Bible) in
worship, and do not accept the use of any non-Biblical hymns; examples are the
Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America, the Westminster Presbyterian
Church in the United States and the Free Church of Scotland (Continuing). Some
Psalms are among the best-known and best-loved passages of Scripture, with a
popularity extending well beyond regular church-goers. New translations and
settings of the Psalms continue to be produced. An individually printed volume
of Psalms for use in Christian religious rituals is called a Psalter. In
Eastern Orthodox Christianity. Orthodox Christians and Greek-Catholics (Eastern
Catholics who follow the Byzantine rite), have long made the Psalms an integral
part of their corporate and private prayers. The official version of the
Psalter used by the Orthodox Church is the Septuagint. To facilitate its
reading, the 150 Psalms are divided into 20 "kathismata" (Greek:
Œ∫Œ±Œ∏ŒπœÉŒºŒ±œÑŒ±; Slavonic: –∫–∞—≥–∏—Å–º—ã, "kafismy"; lit. "sittings"), and
each "kathisma" (Greek: Œ∫Œ±Œ∏ŒπœÉŒºŒ±; Slavonic: –∫–∞—≥–∏—Å–º–∞, "kafisma") is
further subdivided into three "stases" (Greek: œÉœÑŒ±œÉŒµŒπœÇ, "staseis' lit.
"standings", sing. œÉœÑŒ±œÉŒπœÇ, "stasis"), so-called because the faithful
stand at the end of each "stasis" for the Glory to the Father... At Vespers and
Matins, different kathismata are read at different times of the liturgical year
and on different days of the week, according to the Church's calendar, so that
all 150 psalms (20 kathismata) are read in the course of a week. During Great
Lent the number of kathismata are increased so that the entire Psalter is read
twice a week. In the twentieth century, some lay Christians have adopted a
continuous reading of the Psalms on weekdays, praying the whole book in four
weeks. Aside from kathisma readings, Psalms occupy a prominent place in every
other Orthodox service including the services of the Hours and the Divine
Liturgy. In particular, the penitential Psalm 50 is very widely used. Fragments
of Psalms and individual verses are used as Prokimena (introductions to
Scriptural readings), and Stichera. The bulk of Vespers would still be composed
of Psalms even if the kathisma were to be disregarded; Psalm 119, "The Psalm of
the Law", is the centerpiece of Matins on Saturdays, some Sundays, and the
Funeral service. The entire book of Psalms is traditionally read out loud or
chanted at the side of the deceased during the time leading up to the funeral,
mirroring Jewish tradition. Oriental Christianity. Several branches of Oriental
Orthodox and those Eastern Catholics who follow one of the Oriental Rites will
chant the entire Psalter during the course of a day during the Daily Office.
This practice continues to be a requirement of monastics in the Oriental
churches. Roman Catholic usage. The Psalms have always been an important part
of Catholic liturgy. The Liturgy of the Hours is centered on chanting or
recitation of the Psalms, using fixed melodic formulas known as psalm tones.
Early Catholics employed the Psalms widely in their individual prayers also;
however, as knowledge of Latin (the language of the Latin Rite) became
uncommon, this practice ceased among the unlearned. However, until the end of
the Middle Ages it was not unknown for the laity to join in the singing of the
Little Office of Our Lady, which was a shortened version of the Liturgy of the
Hours providing a fixed daily cycle of twenty-five psalms to be recited, and
nine other psalms divided across Matins. The work of Bishop Richard Challoner
in providing devotional materials in English meant that many of the psalms were
familiar to English-speaking Catholics from the eighteenth century onwards.
Challoner translated the entire of the Lady Office into English, as well as
Sunday Vespers and daily Compline. He also provided other individual Psalms
such as 129/130 for prayer in his devotional books. Challoner is also noted for
revising the Douay-Rheims Bible, and the translations he used in his devotional
books are taken from this work. Until the Second Vatican Council the Psalms
were either recited on a one-week or, less frequently (as in the case of
Ambrosian rite), two-week cycle. Different one-week schemata were employed: all
secular clergy followed the Roman distribution, while Monastic Houses almost
universally followed that of St Benedict, with only a few congregations (such
as the Benedictines of St Maur) following individualistic arrangements. The
Breviary introduced in 1974 distributed the psalms over a four-week cycle.
Monastic usage varies widely. Some use the four week cycle of the secular
clergy, many retain a one week cycle, either following St Benedict's scheme or
another of their own devising, while others opt for some other arrangement.
Official approval was also given to other arrangements (see "Short" Breviaries
in the 20th and early 21st century America for an in-progress study) by which
the complete Psalter is recited in a one or two-week cycle. These arrangements
are used principally by Catholic contemplative religious orders, such as that
of the Trappists (see for example the Divine Office schedule at New Melleray
Abbey). Of these three the antiphonal mode is the most widely followed. Over
the centuries, the use of complete Psalms in the liturgy declined. After the
Second Vatican Council (which also permitted the use of vernacular languages in
the liturgy) longer psalm texts were reintroduced into the Mass, during the
readings. The revision of the Roman Missal after the Second Vatican Council
reintroduced the singing or recitation of a more substantial section of a
Psalm, in some cases an entire Psalm, after the first Reading from Scripture.
This Psalm, called the "Responsorial Psalm," is usually sung or recited
responsorially, although the "General Instruction of the Roman Missal", 61
permits direct recitation. Protestant usage. The Psalms are extremely popular
among those who follow the Reformed tradition. Following the Protestant
Reformation, verse paraphrases of many of the Psalms were set as hymns. These
were particularly popular in the Calvinist tradition, where in the past they
were typically sung to the exclusion of hymns. Calvin himself made some French
translations of the Psalms for church usage, but the completed Psalter
eventually used in church services consisted exclusively of translations by
Cl√©ment Marot and Th√©odore de B√®ze, on melodies by a number of composers,
including Louis Bourgeois and a certain Maistre Pierre. Martin Luther's A
Mighty Fortress is Our God is based on Psalm 46. Among famous hymn settings of
the Psalter were the Scottish Psalter and the settings by Isaac Watts. The
first book printed in North America was a collection of Psalm settings, the Bay
Psalm Book (1640). By the 20th century they were mostly replaced by hymns in
church services. However, the Psalms are popular for private devotion among
many Protestants and still used in many churches for traditional worship. There
exists in some circles a custom of reading one Psalm and one chapter of
Proverbs a day, corresponding to the day of the month. Metrical Psalms are
still very popular among many Reformed Churches. Anglican usage. Anglican chant
is a method of singing prose versions of the Psalms. In the early 17th century,
when the King James Bible was introduced, the metrical arrangements by Thomas
Sternhold and John Hopkins were also popular and were provided with printed
tunes. This version and the "New Version of the Psalms of David" by Tate and
Brady produced in the late seventeenth century (see article on Metrical
Psalter) remained the normal congregational way of singing psalms in the Church
of England until well into the nineteenth century. In Great Britain the
Coverdale psalter still lies at the heart of daily worship in Cathedrals and
many parish churches. The new Common Worship service book has a companion
psalter in modern English. The version of the Psalter in the American Book of
Common Prayer prior to the 1979 edition is a sixteenth century Coverdale
Psalter. The Psalter in the American Book of Common Prayer of 1979 is a new
translation, with some attempt to keep the rhythms of the Coverdale Psalter.
Psalms used today. According to Coogan, the Psalms do not mention any of the
Feast Days observed by the Israelites. As a result, they continue to attract
people of all faiths as they can be applied to a variety of contexts that imply
a relationship with God. As prayers that deal primarily with the state of human
beings, they continue to be relevant to people today. Psalms in the Rastafari
movement. The Psalms are one of the most popular parts of the Bible among
followers of the Rastafari movement. Rasta singer Prince Far I released an
atmospheric spoken version of the psalms, Psalms for I, set to a roots reggae
backdrop from The Aggrovators. Psalms set to music. Multiple psalms as a single
composition. Psalms have often been set as part of a larger work. The psalms
feature large in settings of Vespers, including those by Claudio Monteverdi,
Antonio Vivaldi, and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, who wrote such settings as part
of their responsibilities as church musicians. Psalms are inserted in Requiem
compositions, such as Psalm 126 in "A German Requiem" of Johannes Brahms and
Psalms 130 and 23 in John Rutter's "Requiem". Bach. Psalm 129 in Aus der Tiefe,
BWV 131 Contemporary popular music. There are also multiple contemporary
popular artists, such as Soul-Junk, Shane and Shane, and Enter the Worship
Circle, who have set multiple psalms to music on various albums.
