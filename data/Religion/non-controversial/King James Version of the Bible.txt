Authorized King James Version The Authorized Version, commonly known as the
King James Version, King James Bible, AV, KJB, or KJV, is an English
translation of the Christian Bible by the Church of England begun in 1604 and
completed in 1611. First printed by the King's Printer Robert Barker, this was
the third official translation into English. The first was the "Great Bible"
commissioned by the Church of England in the reign of King Henry VIII, and the
second was the "Bishops' Bible" of 1568. In January 1604, King James VI of
Scotland and I of England convened the Hampton Court Conference where a new
English version was conceived in response to the perceived problems of the
earlier translations as detected by the Puritans, a faction within the Church
of England. James gave the translators instructions intended to guarantee that
the new version would conform to the ecclesiology and reflect the episcopal
structure of the Church of England and its belief in an ordained clergy. The
translation was done by 47 scholars, all of whom were members of the Church of
England. In common with most other translations of the period, the New
Testament was translated from Greek, the Old Testament was translated from
Hebrew text, while the Apocrypha were translated from the Greek and Latin. In
the Book of Common Prayer (1662), the text of the "Authorized Version" replaced
the text of the "Great Bible" â€“ for Epistle and Gospel readings â€“ and as
such was authorized by Act of Parliament. By the first half of the 18th
century, the "Authorized Version" was effectively unchallenged as the English
translation used in Anglican and Protestant churches. Over the course of the
18th century, the "Authorized Version" supplanted the Latin Vulgate as the
standard version of scripture for English speaking scholars. Today, the most
used edition of the King James Bible, and often identified as plainly the "King
James Bible" or "King James Version", especially in the United States, remains
the standard text of 1769, edited by Benjamin Blayney and Francis Sawyer Parris
at Oxford. Name. The title of the first edition of the translation was "THE
HOLY BIBLE, Containing the Old Testament, AND THE NEW: Newly Translated out of
the Original tongues: & with the former Translations diligently compared and
revised, by his Majesties special Commandment". The titleâ€“page carries the
words 'Appointed to be read in Churches' and F.F. Bruce suggests it was
"probably authorized by order in council" but no record of the authorization
survives "because the Privy Council registers from 1600 to 1613 were destroyed
by fire in January 1618/19". For many years it was common not to give the
translation any specific name. In his "Leviathan" of 1651, Thomas Hobbes
referred to it as "the English Translation made in the beginning of the Reign
of King James". A 1761 "Brief Account of the various Translations of the Bible
into English" refers to the 1611 version merely as "a new, compleat, and more
accurate Translation", despite referring to the Great Bible by that name, and
despite using the name "Rhemish Testament" for the Douayâ€“Rheims Bible
version. Similarly, a "History of England", whose fifth edition was published
in 1775, writes merely that " new translation of the Bible, "viz.", that now in
Use, was begun in 1607, and published in 1611". King James's Bible is used as
the name for the 1611 translation (on a par with the "Genevan Bible" or the
"Rhemish Testament") in Charles Butler's "Horae Biblicae" (first published
1797). Other works from the early 19th century confirm the widespread use of
this name on both sides of the Atlantic: it is found both in a "Historical
sketch of the English translations of the Bible" published in Massachusetts in
1815, and in an English publication from 1818, which explicitly states that the
1611 version is "generally known by the name of King James's Bible". This name
was also found as King James' Bible (without the final "s"): for example in a
book review from 1811. The "phrase" "King James's Bible" is used as far back as
1715, although in this case it is not clear whether this is a name or merely a
description. The use of Authorized Version or Authorised Version, capitalized
and used as a name, is found as early as 1814. For some time before this
descriptive phrases such as "our present, and only publicly authorized version"
(1783), "our authorised version" (1792), and "the authorized version" (1801,
uncapitalized) are found. The Oxford English Dictionary records a usage in
1824. In Britain, the 1611 translation is generally known as the "Authorized
Version" today. As early as 1814, we find King James' version, evidently a
descriptive phrase, being used. "The King James Version" is found,
unequivocally used as a name, in a 1855 letter. The next year King James Bible,
with no possessive, appears as a name in a Scottish source. In the United
States, the "1611 translation" (actually the standard text of 1769, see below)
is generally known as the "King James Version" or "King James Bible" today.
History. Earlier English translations. The followers of John Wycliffe undertook
the first complete English translations of the Christian scriptures in the 15th
century. These translations were banned in 1409 due to their association with
the Lollards. The Wycliffe Bible pre-dated the printing press but was
circulated very widely in manuscript form, often inscribed with a date earlier
than 1409 to avoid the legal ban. As the text translated in the various
versions of the Wycliffe Bible was the Latin Vulgate, and as it contained no
heterodox readings, there was in practice no way by which the ecclesiastical
authorities could distinguish the banned version; consequently many Catholic
commentators of the 15th and 16th centuries (such as Thomas More) took these
manuscript English Bibles to represent an anonymous earlier orthodox
translation. In 1525, William Tyndale, an English contemporary of Martin
Luther, undertook a translation of the New Testament. Tyndale's translation was
the first "printed" Bible in English. Over the next ten years, Tyndale revised
his New Testament in the light of rapidly advancing biblical scholarship, and
embarked on a translation of the Old Testament. Despite some controversial
translation choices, the merits of Tyndale's work and prose style made his
translation the ultimate basis for all subsequent renditions into Early Modern
English. With these translations lightly edited and adapted by Myles Coverdale,
in 1539, Tyndale's New Testament and his incomplete work on the Old Testament
became the basis for the "Great Bible." This was the first "authorized version"
issued by the Church of England during the reign of King Henry VIII. When Mary
I succeeded to the throne in 1553, she returned the Church of England to the
communion of the Roman Catholic faith and many English religious reformers fled
the country, some establishing an English-speaking colony at Geneva. Under the
leadership of John Calvin, Geneva became the chief international centre of
Reformed Protestantism and Latin biblical scholarship. These English
expatriates undertook a translation that became known as the "Geneva Bible."
This translation, dated to 1560, was a revision of Tyndale's Bible and the
"Great Bible" on the basis of the original languages. Soon after Elizabeth I
took the throne in 1558, the flaws of both the "Great Bible" and the "Geneva
Bible" (namely, that the Geneva Bible did not "conform to the ecclesiology and
reflect the episcopal structure of the Church of England and its beliefs about
an ordained clergy") became painfully apparent. In 1568, the Church of England
responded with the "Bishops' Bible", a revision of the "Great Bible" in the
light of the Geneva version. While officially approved, this new version failed
to displace the Geneva translation as the most popular English Bible of the age
â€“ in part because the full Bible was only printed in lectern editions of
prodigious size and at a cost of several pounds. Accordingly, Elizabethan lay
people overwhelmingly read the Bible in the Geneva Version â€“ small editions
were available at a relatively low cost. At the same time, there was a
substantial clandestine importation of the rival" Douayâ€“Rheims" New Testament
of 1582, undertaken by exiled Roman Catholics. This translation, though still
derived from Tyndale, claimed to represent the text of the Latin Vulgate. In
May 1601, King James VI of Scotland attended the General Assembly of the Church
of Scotland at St Columba's Church in Burntisland, Fife, at which proposals
were put forward for a new translation of the Bible into English. Two years
later, he ascended to the throne of England as King James I of England.
Considerations for a new version. Instructions were given to the translators
that were intended to limit the Puritan influence on this new translation. The
Bishop of London added a qualification that the translators would add no
marginal notes (which had been an issue in the "Geneva Bible"). King James
cited two passages in the Geneva translation where he found the marginal notes
offensive: Exodus 1:19, where the "Geneva Bible" had commended the example of
civil disobedience showed by the Hebrew midwives, and also II Chronicles 15:16,
where the "Geneva Bible" had criticized King Asa for not having executed his
idolatrous grandmother, Queen Maachah. Further, the King gave the translators
instructions designed to guarantee that the new version would conform to the
ecclesiology of the Church of England. Certain Greek and Hebrew words were to
be translated in a manner that reflected the traditional usage of the church.
For example, old ecclesiastical words such as the word "church" were to be
retained and not to be translated as "congregation". The new translation would
reflect the episcopal structure of the Church of England and traditional
beliefs about ordained clergy. James' instructions included several
requirements that kept the new translation familiar to its listeners and
readers. The text of the "Bishops' Bible" would serve as the primary guide for
the translators, and the familiar proper names of the biblical characters would
all be retained. If the "Bishops' Bible" was deemed problematic in any
situation, the translators were permitted to consult other translations from a
pre-approved list: the "Tyndale Bible," the "Coverdale Bible," "Matthew's
Bible," the "Great Bible," and the "Geneva Bible." In addition, later scholars
have detected an influence on the "Authorized Version" from the translations of
"Taverner's Bible" and the New Testament of the "Douayâ€“Rheims Bible." It is
for this reason that the flyleaf of most printings of the "Authorized Version"
observes that the text had been "translated out of the original tongues, and
with the former translations diligently compared and revised, by His Majesty's
special command." The task of translation was undertaken by 47 scholars,
although 54 were originally approved. All were members of the Church of England
and all except Sir Henry Savile were clergy. The scholars worked in six
committees, two based in each of the University of Oxford, the University of
Cambridge, and Westminster. The committees included scholars with Puritan
sympathies, as well as High Churchmen. Forty unbound copies of the 1602 edition
of the "Bishops' Bible" were specially printed so that the agreed changes of
each committee could be recorded in the margins. The committees worked on
certain parts separately and the drafts produced by each committee were then
compared and revised for harmony with each other. The scholars were not paid
directly for their translation work, instead a circular letter was sent to
bishops encouraging them to consider the translators for appointment to well
paid livings as these fell vacant. Several were supported by the various
colleges at Oxford and Cambridge, while others were promoted to bishoprics,
deaneries and prebends through royal patronage. The committees started work
towards the end of 1604. King James I of England, on 22 July 1604, sent a
letter to Archbishop Bancroft asking him to contact all English churchmen
requesting that they make donations to his project. They had all completed
their sections by 1608, the Apocrypha committee finishing first. From January
1609, a General Committee of Review met at Stationers' Hall, London to review
the completed marked texts from each of the six committees. The General
Committee included John Bois, Andrew Downes and John Harmar, and others known
only by their initials, including "AL" (who may be Arthur Lake), and were paid
for their attendance by the Stationers' Company. John Bois prepared a note of
their deliberations (in Latin)Â â€“ which has partly survived in two later
transcripts. Also surviving is a bound-together set of marked-up corrections to
one of the forty "Bishops' Bibles" â€“ covering the Old Testament and Gospels,
and also a manuscript translation of the text of the Epistles, excepting those
verses where no change was being recommended to the readings in the "Bishops'
Bible". Archbishop Bancroft insisted on having a final say, making fourteen
changes, of which one was the term "bishopricke" at Acts 1:20. Printing. The
original printing of the "Authorized Version" was published by Robert Barker,
the King's Printer, in 1611 as a complete folio Bible. It was sold looseleaf
for ten shillings, or bound for twelve. Robert Barker's father, Christopher,
had, in 1589, been granted by Elizabeth I the title of royal Printer, with the
perpetual Royal Privilege to print Bibles in England. Robert Barker invested
very large sums in printing the new edition, and consequently ran into serious
debt, such that he was compelled to sub-lease the privilege to two rival London
printers, Bonham Norton and John Bill. It appears that it was initially
intended that each printer would print a portion of the text, share printed
sheets with the others, and split the proceeds. Bitter financial disputes broke
out, as Barker accused Norton and Bill of concealing their profits, while
Norton and Bill accused Barker of selling sheets properly due to them as
partial Bibles for ready money. There followed decades of continual litigation,
and consequent imprisonment for debt for members of the Barker and Norton
printing dynasties, while each issued rival editions of the whole Bible. In
1629 the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge successfully managed to assert
separate and prior royal licences for Bible printing, for their own university
presses â€“ and Cambridge University took the opportunity to print revised
editions of the "Authorized Version" in 1629, and 1638. The editors of these
editions included John Bois and John Ward from the original translators. This
did not, however, impede the commercial rivalries of the London printers,
especially as the Barker family refused to allow any other printers access to
the authoritative manuscript of the "Authorized Version". Two editions of the
whole Bible are recognized as having been produced in 1611, which may be
distinguished by their rendering of Ruth 3:15; the first edition reading "he
went into the city", where the second reads "she went into the city."; these
are known colloquially as the "He" and "She" Bibles. However, Bibles in all the
early editions were made up using sheets originating from several printers, and
consequently there is very considerable variation within any one edition. It is
only in 1613 that an edition is found, all of whose surviving representatives
have substantially the same text. The original printing was made before English
spelling was standardized, and when printers, as a matter of course, expanded
and contracted the spelling of the same words in different places, so as to
achieve an even column of text. They set v for initial u and v, and u for u and
v everywhere else. They used long Å¿ for non-final s. The glyph j occurs only
after i, as in the final letter in a Roman numeral. Punctuation was relatively
heavy, and differed from current practice. When space needed to be saved, the
printers sometimes used "ye" for "the", (replacing the Middle English thorn
with the continental y), set Ã£ for "an" or "am" (in the style of scribe's
shorthand), and set & for "and". On the contrary, on a few occasions, they
appear to have inserted these words when they thought a line needed to be
padded. Current printings remove most, but not all, of the variant spellings;
the punctuation has also been changed, but still varies from current usage
norms. The first printing used a black letter typeface instead of a roman
typeface, which itself made a political and a religious statement. Like the
Great Bible and the Bishops' Bible, the "Authorized Version" was "appointed to
be read in churches". It was a large folio volume meant for public use, not
private devotion; the weight of the type mirrored the weight of establishment
authority behind it. However, smaller editions and roman-type editions followed
rapidly, e.g. quarto roman-type editions of the Bible in 1612 (Herbert #313/
314). This contrasted with the Geneva Bible, which was the first English Bible
printed in a roman typeface (although black-letter editions, particularly in
folio format, were issued later). In contrast to the "Geneva Bible" and the
"Bishops' Bible", which had both been extensively illustrated, there were no
illustrations at all in the 1611 edition of the "Authorized Version", the main
form of decoration being the historiated initial letters provided for books and
chapters â€“ together with the decorative title pages to the Bible itself, and
to the New Testament. The original printing of the "Authorized Version" used
roman type to distinguish text supplied by translators, or thought needful for
English grammar but not present in the Greek or Hebrew. In the first printing,
the device of having different type faces to show supplied words was used
sparsely and inconsistently. This is perhaps the most significant difference
between the original text and the current text. When, from the later 17th
century onwards, the "Authorized Version" began to be printed in roman type,
the typeface for supplied words was changed to italics. The original printing
contained two prefatory texts; the first was a formal "" to "the most high and
mighty Prince" King James. Many British printings reproduce this, while a few
cheaper or smaller American printings fail to include it. The second preface
was called "The Translators to the Reader", a long and learned essay that
defends the undertaking of the new version. It observes that the translators'
goal was not to make a bad translation good, but a good translation better, and
says that "we do not deny, nay we affirm and avow, that the very meanest
translation of the Bible in English, set forth by men of our profession ...
containeth the word of God, nay, is the word of God" in English. The first
printing contained a number of other apparatus, including a table for the
reading of the Psalms at matins and evensong, and a calendar, an almanac, and a
table of holy days and observances. Much of this material became obsolete with
the adoption of the Gregorian Calendar by Britain and its colonies in 1752, and
thus modern editions invariably omit it. So as to make it easier to locate a
particular passage, each chapter was headed by a brief precis of its contents
with verse numbers. Later editors freely substituted their own chapter
summaries, or omit such material entirely. Pilcrow marks are used to indicate
the beginnings of paragraphs in the Gospels and Acts, but rarely elsewhere.
"Authorized Version". While the "Authorized Version" was meant to replace the
"Bishops' Bible" as the official version for readings in the Church of England,
it was apparently (unlike the "Great Bible") never specifically "authorized",
although it is commonly known as the "Authorized Version" in the United
Kingdom. However, the King's Printer issued no further editions of the
"Bishops' Bible", so necessarily the "Authorized Version" supplanted it as the
standard lectern Bible in parish church use in England. In the 1662 "Book Of
Common Prayer," the text of the "Authorized Version" finally supplanted that of
the "Great Bible" in the Epistle and Gospel readings â€“ though the Prayer Book
Psalter nevertheless continues in the Great Bible version. The case was
different in Scotland, where the Geneva Bible had long been the standard Church
Bible. It was not until 1633 that a Scottish edition of the "Authorized
Version" was printed â€“ in conjunction with the Scots coronation in that year
of Charles I. The inclusion of illustrations in the edition raised accusations
of Popery from opponents of the religious policies of Charles, and of William
Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury. However, official policy favoured the
"Authorized Version", and this favour returned during the Commonwealth â€“ as
London printers succeeded in re-asserting their monopoly of Bible printing with
support from Oliver Cromwell â€“ and the "New Translation" was the only edition
on the market. F.F. Bruce reports that the last recorded instance of a Scots
parish continuing to use the "Old Translation" (i.e. Geneva) as being in 1674.
The "Authorized Version's" acceptance by the general public took longer. The
"Geneva Bible" continued to be popular, and large numbers were imported from
Amsterdam, where printing continued up to 1644 in editions carrying a false
London imprint. However, few if any genuine Geneva editions appear to have been
printed in London after 1616, and in 1637 Archbishop Laud prohibited their
printing or importation. In the period of the English Civil War, soldiers of
the New Model Army were issued a book of Geneva selections called ""The
Soldiers' Bible"" (1643, Herbert #577). In the first half of the 17th century
the "Authorized Version" is most commonly referred to as "The Bible without
notes", thereby distinguishing it from the Geneva "Bible with notes". There
were several printings of the "Authorized Version" in Amsterdam â€“ one as late
as 1715 (Herbert #936)Â â€“ which combined the "Authorized Version" translation
text with the Geneva marginal notes; one such edition was printed in London in
1649. During the Commonwealth a commission was established by Parliament to
recommend a revision of the "Authorized Version" with acceptably Protestant
explanatory notes, but the project was abandoned when it became clear that
these would be nearly double the bulk of the Bible text. After the English
Restoration, the "Geneva Bible" was held to be politically suspect and a
reminder of the repudiated Puritan era. Furthermore, disputes over the
lucrative rights to print the "Authorized Version" dragged on through the 17th
century, so none of the printers involved saw any commercial advantage in
marketing a rival translation. The "Authorized Version" became the only current
version circulating among English speaking people. Slowest of all was
acceptance of the text by Biblical Scholars. Hugh Broughton, the most highly
regarded English Hebraist of his time (but who had been excluded from the panel
of translators because of his utterly uncongenial temperament), issued in 1611
a total condemnation of the new version, criticizing especially the
translators' rejection of word-for-word equivalence and stated that "he would
rather be torn in pieces by wild horses than that this abominable translation
(KJV) should ever be foisted upon the English people". Walton's London Polyglot
of 1657 disregards the "Authorized Version" (and indeed the English Language)
entirely. Walton's reference text throughout is the Vulgate. The Vulgate Latin
is also found as the standard text of scripture in Thomas Hobbes's "Leviathan"
of 1651, indeed Hobbes gives Vulgate chapter and verse numbers (e.g., Job 41:
24, not Job 41:33) for his head text. In Chapter 35: " 'The Signification in
Scripture of Kingdom of God' ", Hobbes discusses Exodus 19:5, first in his own
translation of the" 'Vulgar Latin' ", and then subsequently as found in the
versions he terms ""...the English translation made in the beginning of the
reign of King James"", and ""The Geneva French"" (i.e. OlivÃ©tan). Hobbes
advances detailed critical arguments why the Vulgate rendering is to be
preferred. For most of the 17th century the assumption remained that, while it
had been of vital importance to provide the scriptures in the vernacular for
ordinary people, nevertheless for those with sufficient education to do so,
Biblical study was best undertaken within the international common medium of
Latin. It was only in 1700 that modern bilingual Bibles appeared in which the
Authorized Version was compared with counterpart Dutch and French Protestant
vernacular Bibles. In consequence of the continual disputes over printing
privileges, successive printings of the "Authorized Version" were notably less
careful than the 1611 edition had been â€“ compositors freely varying spelling,
capitalization and punctuation â€“ and also, over the years, introducing about
1,500 misprints (some of which, like the omission of "not" from the commandment
"Thou shalt not commit adultery" in the "Wicked Bible" (1631, Herbert #444),
became notorious). The two Cambridge editions of 1629 and 1638 attempted to
restore the proper text â€“ while introducing over 200 revisions of the
original translators' work, chiefly by incorporating into the main text a more
literal reading originally presented as a marginal note. A more thoroughly
corrected edition was proposed following the Restoration, in conjunction with
the revised 1662 Book of Common Prayer, but Parliament then decided against it.
By the first half of the 18th century, the "Authorized Version" was effectively
unchallenged as the sole English translation in current use in Protestant
churches, and was so dominant that the Roman Catholic church in England issued
in 1750 a revision of the 1610 "Douayâ€“Rheims Bible" by Richard Challoner that
was very much closer to the "Authorized Version" than to the original. However,
general standards of spelling, punctuation, typesetting, capitalization and
grammar had changed radically in the 100 years since the first edition of the
"Authorized Version", and all printers in the market were introducing continual
piecemeal changes to their Bible texts to bring them into line with current
practice â€“ and with public expectations of standardized spelling and
grammatical construction. Over the course of the 18th century, the "Authorized
Version" supplanted the Latin Vulgate as the standard version of scripture for
English speaking scholars and divines, and indeed came to be regarded by some
as an inspired text in itself â€“ so much so that any challenge to its readings
or textual base came to be regarded by many as an assault on Holy Scripture.
Standard text of 1769. By the mid-18th century the wide variation in the
various modernized printed texts of the "Authorized Version", combined with the
notorious accumulation of misprints, had reached the proportion of a scandal,
and the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge both sought to produce an updated
standard text. First of the two was the Cambridge edition of 1760, the
culmination of twenty-years work by Francis Sawyer Parris, who died in May of
that year. This 1760 edition was reprinted without change in 1762 (Herbert
#1142) and in John Baskerville's fine folio edition of 1763. This was
effectively superseded by the 1769 Oxford edition, edited by Benjamin Blayney
(Herbert #1196), though with comparatively few changes from the 1760 edition,
which became the Oxford standard text, and is reproduced almost unchanged in
most current printings. Parris and Blayney sought consistently to remove those
elements of the 1611 and subsequent editions that they believed were due to the
vagaries of printers, while incorporating most of the revised readings of the
Cambridge editions of 1629 and 1638, and each also introducing a few improved
readings of their own. They undertook the mammoth task of standardizing the
wide variation in punctuation and spelling of the original, making many
thousands of minor changes to the text; although some of these updates do alter
the ostensible sense â€“ as when the original text of Genesis 2:21 "in stead"
("in that place") was updated to read "instead" ("as an alternative"). In
addition, Blayney and Parris thoroughly revised and greatly extended the
italicization of "supplied" words not found in the original languages by cross-
checking against the presumed source texts. Unfortunately, Blayney assumed that
the translators of the 1611 New Testament had worked from the 1550 Stephanus
edition of the Textus Receptus, rather than from the later editions of Beza;
accordingly the current standard text mistakenly "corrects" around a dozen
readings where Beza and Stephanus differ. Like the 1611 edition, the 1769
Oxford edition included the Apocrypha, although Blayney consistently removed
cross-references to the Books of the Apocrypha from the margins of their Old
and New Testaments wherever these had been provided by the original
translators. Altogether, Blayney's 1769 text differed from the 1611 text in
around 24,000 places. Since that date, only six further changes have been
introduced to the standard text â€“ although 30 of Blayney's proposed changes
have subsequently been reverted. The Oxford University Press paperback edition
of the ""Authorized King James Version"" provides the current standard text,
and also includes the prefatory section "The Translators to the Reader". The
1611 and 1760 texts of the first three verses from "I Corinthians 13" are given
below. 1. Though I speake with the tongues of men & of Angels, and have not
charity, I am become as sounding brasse or a tinkling cymbal. 2 And though I
have the gift of prophesie, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge: and
though I have all faith, so that I could remoove mountaines, and have no
charitie, I am nothing. 3 And though I bestowe all my goods to feede the poore,
and though I give my body to bee burned, and have not charitie, it profiteth me
nothing. 1. Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not
charity, I am become "as" sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. 2 And though I
have "the gift of" prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge;
and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not
charity, I am nothing. 3 And though I bestow all my goods to feed "the poor",
and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me
nothing. In these three verses, there are eleven changes of spelling, nine
changes of typesetting, three changes of punctuation, and one variant text â€“
where "no charity" is substituted for "not charity" in verse two, in the
erroneous belief that the original reading was a misprint. A particular verse
for which Blayney's 1769 text differs from Parris's 1760 version is Matthew 5:
13, where Parris (1760) has Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have
lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for
nothing but to be cast out, and to be troden under foot of men. Blayney (1769)
changes 'lost his savour' to 'lost its savour', and troden to trodden. For a
period, Cambridge continued to issue Bibles using the Parris text, but the
market demand for absolute standardization was now such that they eventually
fell into line. Since the beginning of the 19th century, almost all printings
of the "Authorized Version" have derived from the 1769 Oxford text â€“
generally without Blayney's variant notes and cross references, and commonly
excluding the Apocrypha. One exception to this was a scrupulous original-
spelling, page-for-page, and line-for-line reprint of the 1611 edition
(including all chapter headings, marginalia, and original italicization, but
with Roman type substituted for the black letter of the original), published by
Oxford in 1833. Another important exception was the 1873 Cambridge Paragraph
Bible, thoroughly revised, modernized and re-edited by F. H. A. Scrivener, who
for the first time consistently identified the source texts underlying the 1611
translation and its marginal notes. Scrivener, however â€“ as Blayney had done
â€“ did adopt revised readings where he considered the judgement of the 1611
translators had been faulty. In 2005, Cambridge University Press released its
New Cambridge Paragraph Bible with Apocrypha, edited by David Norton, which
modernized Scrivener's spelling again to present-day standards and introduced
quotation marks, while restoring the 1611 text, so far as possible, to the
wording intended by its translators, especially in the light of the rediscovery
of some of their working documents. This text has been issued in paperback by
Penguin books. From 1769, the text of the "Authorized Version" remained
unchanged â€“ and since, due to advances in printing technology, it could now
be produced in very large editions for mass sale, it established complete
dominance in public and ecclesiastical use in the English-speaking Protestant
world. Academic debate over the next hundred years, however, increasingly
reflected concerns about the "Authorized Version" shared by some scholars: (a)
that subsequent study in oriental languages suggested a need to revise the
translation of the Hebrew Bible â€“ both in terms of specific vocabulary, and
also in distinguishing descriptive terms from proper names; (b) that the
"Authorized Version" was unsatisfactory in translating the same Greek words and
phrases into different English, especially where parallel passages are found in
the synoptic gospels; and (c) in the light of subsequent ancient manuscript
discoveries, the New Testament translation base of the Greek Textus Receptus
could no longer be considered to be the best representation of the original
text. Responding to these concerns, the Convocation of Canterbury resolved in
1870 to undertake a revision of the text of the "Authorized Version", intending
to retain the original text "except where in the judgement of competent
scholars such a change is necessary". The resulting revision was issued as the
Revised Version in 1881 (New Testament), 1885 (Old Testament) and 1894
(Apocrypha); but, although it sold widely, the revision did not find popular
favour, and it was only reluctantly in 1899 that Convocation approved it for
reading in churches. The "Authorized Version" maintained its effective
dominance throughout the first half of the 20th century. New translations in
the second half of the 20th century displaced its 250 years of dominance
(roughly 1700 to 1950), but groups do exist â€“ sometimes termed the King James
Only movement â€“ that distrust anything not in agreement with ("that changes")
the "Authorized Version". Literary attributes. Translation. The English terms
"rejoice" and "glory" stand for the same word in the Greek original. In
Tyndale, "Geneva" and the "Bishops' Bibles", both instances are translated
"rejoice". In the "Douayâ€“Rheims" New Testament, both are translated "glory".
Only in the "Authorized Version" does the translation vary between the two
verses. In obedience to their instructions, the translators provided no
marginal interpretation of the text, but in some 8,500 places a marginal note
offers an alternative English wording. The majority of these notes offer a more
literal rendering of the original (introduced as "Heb", "Chal", "Gr" or "Lat"),
but others indicate a variant reading of the source text (introduced by "or").
Some of the annotated variants derive from alternative editions in the original
languages, or from variant forms quoted in the fathers. More commonly, though,
they indicate a difference between the original language reading and that in
the translators' preferred recent Latin versions: Tremellius for the Old
Testament, Junius for the Apocrypha, and Beza for the New Testament. A few more
extensive notes clarify Biblical names, units of measurement or currency, and
in a very few places (e.g. Luke 17:36) record that a verse is absent from most
Greek manuscripts. Modern reprintings rarely reproduce these annotated variants
â€“ although they are to be found in the New Cambridge Paragraph Bible. In
addition, there were originally some 9,000 scriptural cross-references, in
which one text was related to another. Such cross-references had long been
common in Latin Bibles, and most of those in the "Authorized Version" were
copied unaltered from this Latin tradition. Consequently the early editions of
the KJV retain many Vulgate verse references â€“ e.g. in the numbering of the
Psalms. At the head of each chapter, the translators provided a short prÃ©cis
of its contents, with verse numbers; these are rarely included in complete form
in modern editions. In the Old testament the translators render the
Tetragrammaton YHWH by "the LORD" (in later editions in small capitals as ), or
"the LORD God" (for "Adonai YHWH", "Lord YHWH"), and in four places by
"IEHOVAH" (Exod. 6:3, Psalm 83:18, Isaiah 12:2 and 26:4). Old Testament. For
their Old Testament, the translators used a text originating in the editions of
the Hebrew Rabbinic Bible by Daniel Bomberg (1524/5), but adjusted this to
conform to the Greek LXX or Latin Vulgate in passages to which Christian
tradition had attached a Christological interpretation. For example, the
Septuagint reading "They pierced my hands and my feet" was used in Psalm 22:16
(vs. the Masoretes' reading of the Hebrew "like lions my hands and feet").
Otherwise, however, the "Authorized Version" is closer to the Hebrew tradition
than any previous English translation â€“ especially in making use of the
rabbinic commentaries, such as Kimhi, in elucidating obscure passages in the
Masoretic Text; earlier versions had been more likely to adopt LXX or Vulgate
readings in such places. New Testament. For their New Testament, the
translators chiefly used the 1598 and 1588/89 Greek editions of Theodore Beza,
which also present Beza's Latin version of the Greek and Stephanus's edition of
the Latin Vulgate. Both of these versions were extensively referred to, as the
translators conducted all discussions amongst themselves in Latin. F.H.A.
Scrivener identifies 190 readings where the "Authorized Version" translators
depart from Beza's Greek text, generally in maintaining the wording of the
"Bishop's Bible" and other earlier English translations. In about half of these
instances, the "Authorized Version" translators appear to follow the earlier
1550 Greek Textus Receptus of Stephanus. For the other half, Scrivener was
usually able to find corresponding Greek readings in the editions of Erasmus,
or in the Complutensian Polyglot. However, in several dozen readings he notes
that no printed Greek text corresponds to the English of the "Authorized
Version", which in these places derives directly from the Vulgate. For example,
at John 10:16, the Authorized Version reads "one fold" (as did the "Bishops'
Bible", and the 16th century vernacular versions produced in Geneva), following
the Latin Vulgate "unum ovile", whereas Tyndale had agreed more closely with
the Greek, "one flocke" (Î¼Î¯Î± Ï€Î¿Î¯Î¼Î½Î·). The "Authorized Version" New
Testament owes much more to the Vulgate than does the Old Testament; still, at
least 80% of the text is unaltered from Tyndale's translation. Apocrypha.
Unlike the rest of the Bible, the translators of the Apocrypha identified their
source texts in their marginal notes. From these it can be determined that the
books of the Apocrypha were translated from the Septuagint â€“ primarily, from
the Greek Old Testament column in the "Antwerp Polyglot" â€“ but with extensive
reference to the counterpart Latin Vulgate text, and to Junius's Latin
translation. The translators record references to the Sixtine Septuagint of
1587, which is substantially a printing of the Old Testament text from the
Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209, and also to the 1518 Greek Septuagint edition of
Aldus Manutius. They had, however, no Greek texts for 2 Esdras, or for the
Prayer of Manasses, and Scrivener found that they here used an unidentified
Latin manuscript. Sources. The translators appear to have otherwise made no
first-hand study of ancient manuscript sources, even those that â€“ like the
Codex Bezae â€“ would have been readily available to them. In addition to all
previous English versions, including the" Douayâ€“Rheims Bible", they also
consulted contemporary vernacular translations in Spanish, French, Italian and
German. They also made wide and eclectic use of all printed editions in the
original languages then available, including the ancient Syriac New Testament
printed with an interlinear Latin gloss in the Antwerp Polyglot of 1573. The
translators took the Bishop's Bible as their source text, and where they
departed from that in favour of another translation, this was most commonly the
Geneva Bible. However, the degree to which readings from the Bishop's Bible
survived into final text of the King James Bible varies greatly from company to
company, as did the propensity of the King James translators to coin phrases of
their own. John Bois's notes of the General Committee of Review show that they
discussed readings derived from a wide variety of sources and versions,
including explicitly both Henry Savile's 1610 edition of the works of John
Chrysostom, and also the Rheims New Testament, which was the primary source for
many of the literal alternative readings provided for the marginal notes.
Variations from recent translations. A number of Bible verses in the King James
Version of the New Testament are not found in recent Bible translations based
on modern critical texts. In the early seventeenth century printed Greek texts
of the New Testament depended on manuscripts of the late Byzantine text-type
and with minor variations contained what is known as the Textus Receptus. With
the discovery of many early manuscripts, most modern textual scholars value the
evidence of manuscripts belonging to the Alexandrian family as better witnesses
to the original text of the biblical authors, without giving it, or any family,
automatic preference. Style and criticism. A primary concern of the translators
was to produce a Bible that would be appropriate, dignified and resonant in
public reading. Although the "Authorized Version"'s written style is an
important part of its influence on English, research has found only one
verseÂ â€“ Hebrews 13:8Â â€“ for which translators debated the wording's
literary merits. While they stated in the preface that they used stylistic
variation, finding multiple English words or verbal forms in places where the
original language employed repetition, in practice they also did the opposite;
for example, 14 different Hebrew words were translated into the single English
word "prince". In a period of rapid linguistic change the translators avoided
contemporary idioms, tending instead towards forms that were already slightly
archaic, like "verily" and "it came to pass". The pronouns "thou"/"thee" and
"you" are consistently used as singular and plural respectively, even though by
this time "you" was often found as the singular in general English usage,
especially when addressing a social superior (as is evidenced, for example, in
Shakespeare). For the possessive of the third person pronoun, the word "its",
first recorded in the "Oxford English Dictionary" in 1598, is avoided. The
older "his" is usually employed, as for example at Matthew 5:13: "if the salt
have lost "his" savour, wherewith shall it be salted?"; in other places "of
it", "thereof" or bare "it" are found. Another sign of linguistic
conservativism is the invariable use of "-eth" for the third person singular
present form of the verb, as at Matthew 2:13: "the Angel of the Lord
appear"eth" to Joseph in a dreame". The rival ending "-(e)s", as found in
present-day English, was already widely used by this time (for example, it
predominates over "-eth" in the plays of Shakespeare and Marlowe). Furthermore,
the translators preferred "which" to "who" or "whom" as the relative pronoun
for persons, as in Genesis 13:5: "And Lot also "which" went with Abram, had
flocks and heards, & tents" although "who(m)" is also found. The "Authorized
Version" is notably more Latinate than previous English versions, especially
the Geneva Bible. This results in part from the academic stylistic preferences
of a number of the translatorsÂ â€“ several of whom admitted to being more
comfortable writing in Latin than in EnglishÂ â€“ but was also, in part, a
consequence of the royal proscription against explanatory notes. Hence, where
the Geneva Bible might use a common English wordÂ â€“ and gloss its particular
application in a marginal noteÂ â€“ the "Authorized Version" tends rather to
prefer a technical term, frequently in Anglicized Latin. Consequently, although
the King had instructed the translators to use the Bishops' Bible as a base
text, the New Testament in particular owes much stylistically to the Catholic
Rheims New Testament, whose translators had also been concerned to find English
equivalents for Latin terminology. In addition, the translators of the New
Testament books habitually quote Old Testament names in the renderings familiar
from the Vulgate Latin, rather than in their Hebrew forms (e.g. "Elias",
"Jeremias" for "Elijah", "Jeremiah"). While the "Authorized Version" remains
among the most widely sold, modern critical New Testament translations differ
substantially from it in a number of passages, primarily because they rely on
source manuscripts not then accessible to (or not then highly regarded by)
early 17th-century Biblical scholarship. In the Old Testament, there are also
many differences from modern translations that are based not on manuscript
differences, but on a different understanding of Ancient Hebrew vocabulary or
grammar by the translators. For example, in modern translations it is clear
that Job 28: 1â€“11 is referring throughout to mining operations, which is not
at all apparent from the text of the "Authorized Version". Influence. Despite
royal patronage and encouragement, there was never any overt mandate to use the
new translation. It was not until 1661 that the "Authorized Version" replaced
the "Bishops Bible" in the Epistle and Gospel lessons of the Book of Common
Prayer, and it never did replace the older translation in the Psalter. In 1763
"The Critical Review" complained that "many false interpretations, ambiguous
phrases, obsolete words and indelicate expressions...excite the derision of the
scorner". Blayney's 1769 version, with its revised spelling and punctuation,
helped to change the public perception of the "Authorized Version" to a
masterpiece of the English language. By the 19th century, F. W. Faber could say
of the translation, "It lives on the ear, like music that can never be
forgotten, like the sound of church bells, which the convert hardly knows how
he can forego." The "Authorized Version" has been called "the most influential
version of the most influential book in the world, in what is now its most
influential language", "the most important book in English religion and
culture", and "the most celebrated book in the English-speaking world". It has
contributed 257 idioms to English, more than any other single source, including
Shakespeare; examples include feet of clay and . Although the "Authorized
Version"'s former monopoly in the English-speaking world has diminishedÂ â€“
for example, the Church of England recommends six other versions in addition to
itÂ â€“ it is still the most popular translation in the United States,
especially among Evangelicals. Copyright status. The "Authorized Version" is in
the public domain in most of the world. However, in the United Kingdom, the
right to print, publish and distribute it is a Royal prerogative and the Crown
licenses publishers to reproduce it under letters patent. In England, Wales and
Northern Ireland the letters patent are held by the Queen's Printer, and in
Scotland by the Scottish Bible Board. The office of Queen's Printer has been
associated with the right to reproduce the Bible for centuries, the earliest
known reference coming in 1577. In the 18th century all surviving interests in
the monopoly were bought out by John Baskett. The Baskett rights descended
through a number of printers and, in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the
Queen's Printer is now Cambridge University Press, who inherited the right when
they took over the firm of Eyre & Spottiswoode in 1990. Other royal charters of
similar antiquity grant Cambridge University Press and Oxford University Press
the right to produce the "Authorized Version" independently of the Queen's
Printer. In Scotland the "Authorized Version" is published by Collins under
licence from the Scottish Bible Board. The terms of the letters patent prohibit
any other than the holders, or those authorized by the holders, from printing,
publishing or importing the "Authorized Version" into the United Kingdom. The
protection that the "Authorized Version", and also the "Book of Common Prayer,"
enjoy is the last remnant of the time when the Crown held a monopoly over all
printing and publishing in the United Kingdom. Apocrypha. English-language
Protestant Bibles in the 16th century included the books of the "Apocrypha" â€“
generally in a separate section between the Old and New Testaments â€“ and
there is evidence that these were widely read as popular literature, especially
in Puritan circles. However, starting in 1630, volumes of the "Geneva Bible"
were occasionally bound with the pages of the Apocrypha section excluded. In
1644 the Long Parliament forbade the reading of the Apocrypha in Church and in
1666 the first editions of the King James Bible without Apocrypha were bound.
The standardization of the text of the "Authorized Version" after 1769 together
with the technological development of Stereotype printing made it possible to
produce Bibles in large-print runs at very low unit prices. For commercial and
charitable publishers, editions of the "Authorized Version" without the
Apocrypha reduced the cost, while having increased market appeal to non-
Anglican Protestant readers. With the rise of the Bible societies, most
editions have omitted the whole section of Apocryphal books. Further reading.
