Monotheism Monotheism (from Greek , "monos", "single", and , "theos", "god") is
the belief in the existence of one god or in the oneness of God. Monotheism is
characteristic of Atenism, Bah√°'√≠ Faith, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam,
Ravidassia, Judaism, Sabianism, Sikhism and Zoroastrianism. Origin and
development. The word "monotheism" is derived from the Greek ("monos") meaning
"single" and ("theos") meaning "god". The English term was first used by Henry
More (1614‚Äì1687). Some writers such as Karen Armstrong believe that the
concept of monotheism sees a gradual development out of notions of henotheism
(worshiping a single god while accepting the existence or possible existence of
other deities) and monolatrism (the recognition of the existence of many gods,
but with the consistent worship of only one deity). However, the historical
incidences of monotheism are so rare, that it's difficult to support any theory
of the natural progression of religions from polytheism to henotheism to
monotheism. Two examples of monolatrism developing from polytheism are the Aten
cult in the reign of the Egyptian pharaoh Akhenaten, as well as the rise of
Marduk from the tutelary of Babylon to the claim of universal supremacy. In
Iran, Zoroastrianism, Ahura Mazda appears as a supreme and transcendental
deity. Depending on the date of Zoroaster (usually placed in the early Iron
Age), this may be one of the earliest documented instances of the emergence of
monism in an Indo-European religion. In the ancient Near East, each city had a
local patron deity, such as Shamash at Larsa or Sin at Ur. The first claims of
global supremacy of a specific god date to the Late Bronze Age, with
Akhenaten's "Great Hymn to the Aten" (speculatively connected to Judaism by
Sigmund Freud in his "Moses and Monotheism"). However the date of the Exodus is
disputed, and it is not definitive whether the setting of the biblical Exodus
event is prior to or following Akhenaten's reign. Furthermore it is not clear
to what extent Akhenaten's Atenism was monotheistic rather than henotheistic
with Akhenaten himself identified with the god Aten. Currents of monism or
monotheism emerge in Vedic India earlier, with e.g. the Nasadiya Sukta. In the
Indo-Iranian tradition, the Rigveda exhibits notions of monism, in particular
in the comparatively late tenth book, also dated to the early Iron Age, e.g. in
the Nasadiya sukta. Ethical monotheism and the associated concept of absolute
good and evil emerge in Zoroastrianism and Judaism, later culminating in the
doctrines of Christology in early Christianity and later (by the 7th century)
in the "tawhid" in Islam. In Islamic theology, a person who spontaneously
"discovers" monotheism is called a "·∏•anƒ´f", the original "·∏•anƒ´f" being
Abraham. Austrian anthropologist Wilhelm Schmidt in the 1910s postulated an
"Urmonotheismus", "original" or "primitive monotheism." Definitions. Monotheism
is the belief in a singular God, in contrast to polytheism, the belief in
several deities. Polytheism can, however, be reconcilable with inclusive
monotheism (monolatrism) or other forms of monism. The distinction between
inclusive monotheism and polytheism is not clear or objective in light of that.
Atenism. Amenhotep IV initially introduced Atenism in Year 5 of his reign
(1348/1346 BC), raising the Aten to the status of Supreme God, after initially
permitting the continued worship of the traditional gods. To emphasise the
change, Aten's name was written in the cartouche form normally reserved for
Pharaohs, an innovation of Atenism. This religious reformation appears to
coincide with the proclamation of a Sed festival, a sort of royal jubilee
intended to reinforce the Pharaoh's divine powers of kingship. Traditionally
held in the thirtieth year of the Pharaoh's reign, this possibly was a festival
in honour of Amenhotep III, whom some Egyptologists think had a coregency with
his son Amenhotep IV of two to twelve years. Year 5 is believed to mark the
beginning of Amenhotep IV's construction of a new capital, Akhetaten ("Horizon
of the Aten"), at the site known today as Amarna. Evidence of this appears on
three of the boundary stelae used to mark the boundaries of this new capital.
At this time, Amenhotep IV officially changed his name to Akhenaten ("Agreeable
to Aten") as evidence of his new worship. The date given for the event has been
estimated to fall around January 2 of that year. In Year 7 of his reign (1346/
1344 BCE) the capital was moved from Thebes to Akhetaten (near modern Amarna),
though construction of the city seems to have continued for two more years. In
shifting his court from the traditional ceremonial centres Akhenaten was
signalling a dramatic transformation in the focus of religious and political
power. The move separated the Pharaoh and his court from the influence of the
priesthood and from the traditional centres of worship, but his decree had
deeper religious significance too‚Äîtaken in conjunction with his name change,
it is possible that the move to Amarna was also meant as a signal of
Akhenaten's symbolic death and rebirth. It may also have coincided with the
death of his father and the end of the coregency. In addition to constructing a
new capital in honor of Aten, Akhenaten also oversaw the construction of some
of the most massive temple complexes in ancient Egypt, including one at Karnak
and one at Thebes, close to the old temple of Amun. In Year 9 (1344/1342 BCE),
Akhenaten strengthened the Atenist regime, declaring the Aten to be not merely
the supreme god, but the "only" god, a universal deity, and forbidding worship
of all others, including the veneration of idols, even privately in people's
homes‚Äîan arena the Egyptian state had previously not touched in religious
terms. Aten was addressed by Akhenaten in prayers, such as the "Great Hymn to
the Aten": "O Sole God beside whom there is none". The Egyptian people were to
worship Akhenaten; only Akhenaten and Nefertiti could worship Aten. Indigenous
American tradition. Traditional Native Americans believe in a creator,
variously referred to as Great Spirit, Great Creator or Great One, who is the
originator of creation. Indo-European religions. Proto-Indo-European religion.
In the Proto-Indo-European religion, the supreme god is Dyeus, as the word
"Dyeus" is literally used in many Indo-European language cognates to denote a
supreme god. In western Eurasia, the ancient traditions of the Slavic religion
had elements of monotheism, of a supreme deity known by many names worshiped by
some tribes. The most common name of the supreme deity is Perun and was
identified with the Christian God after Christianization. In speaking of
Henotheism, Indo-European religions have had shifting tendencies regarding
their supreme god. Consider the ruler of lightning: the supreme god Zeus,
Perun, Jupiter controlled lightning himself; while in Norse mythology Odin
delegated the power of lightning to his son Thor. In this vein, phenomena
controlled by any single henotheistic god differ widely among various Indo-
European religions. Indo-Iranian religions. Indian religions. Hinduism. As an
old religion, Hinduism inherits religious concepts spanning monotheism,
polytheism, panentheism, pantheism, monism, and atheism among others; and its
concept of God is complex and depends upon each individual and the tradition
and philosophy followed. Hindu views are broad and range from monism, through
pantheism and panentheism (alternatively called monistic theism by some
scholars) to monotheism and even atheism. Hinduism cannot be said to be purely
polytheistic, as all great Hindu religious leaders have repeatedly stressed
that while God's forms are many and the ways to communicate with him are many,
God is one. The "puja" of the "murti" is a way to communicate with the abstract
one God ("Brahman") which creates, sustains and dissolves creation. Rig Veda
1.164.46, Traditions of Gaudiya Vaishnavas, the Nimbarka Sampradaya and
followers of Swaminarayan and Vallabha consider Krishna to be the source of all
avatars, and the source of Vishnu himself, or to be the same as Narayana. As
such, he is therefore regarded as "Svayam Bhagavan". When Krishna is recognized
to be "Svayam Bhagavan", it can be understood that this is the belief of
Gaudiya Vaishnavism, the Vallabha Sampradaya, and the Nimbarka Sampradaya,
where Krishna is accepted to be the source of all other avatars, and the source
of Vishnu himself. This belief is drawn primarily "from the famous statement of
the Bhagavatam" (1.3.28). A different viewpoint differing from this theological
concept is the concept of Krishna as an "avatar" of Narayana or Vishnu. It
should be however noted that although it is usual to speak of Vishnu as the
source of the avataras, this is only one of the names of the God of
Vaishnavism, who is also known as Narayana, Vasudeva and Krishna and behind
each of those names there is a divine figure with attributed supremacy in
Vaishnavism. "Devas are always looking to the supreme abode of Vishnu" ("tad
vi·π£·πáo·∏• parama·πÅ pada·πÅ sadƒÅ pa≈õyanti s·πªraya·∏•" Rig Veda 1.22.20)
"The One Truth, sages know by many names" (Rig Veda 1.164.46) "When at first
the unborn sprung into being, He won His own dominion beyond which nothing
higher has been in existence" (Atharva Veda 10.7.31) "There is none to compare
with Him. There is no parallel to Him, whose glory, verily, is great." (Yajur
Veda 32.3) In the Shaivite tradition, the "Shri Rudram" (Sanskrit ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø
‡§∞‡•Å‡§¶‡•ç‡§∞‡§Æ‡•ç), to which the Chamakam (‡§ö‡§Æ‡§ï‡§Æ‡•ç) is added by
scriptural tradition, is a Hindu "stotra" dedicated to Rudra (an epithet of
Shiva), taken from the Yajurveda (TS 4.5, 4.7). Shri Rudram is also known as
"Sri Rudraprasna", "", and "Rudradhyaya". The text is important in Vedanta
where Shiva is equated to the Universal supreme God. The hymn is an early
example of enumerating the names of a deity, a tradition developed extensively
in the sahasranama literature of Hinduism. they assume such omniscient beings,
those endowed with the various superhuman faculties of assuming infinitesimal
size, and so on, and capable of creating everything, then we reply that the
"law of parsimony" bids us assume only one such, namely Him, the adorable Lord.
There can be no confidence in a non-eternal and non-omniscient being, and hence
it follows that according to the system which rejects God, the tradition of the
Veda is simultaneously overthrown; there is no other way open. In other words,
Nyaya says that the polytheist would have to give elaborate proofs for the
existence and origin of his several celestial spirits, none of which would be
logical, and that it is more logical to assume one eternal, omniscient god.
Sikhism. Sikhi is a monotheistic and a revealed religion. God in Sikhi is
called "VƒÅhigur≈´", and is shapeless, timeless, and sightless: "", "akaal",
and "alakh". God is present ("sarav viƒÅpak") in all of creation. God must be
seen from "the inward eye", or the "heart". Sikhi devotees must meditate to
progress towards enlightenment, as its rigorous application permits the
existence of communication between God and human beings. The word "‡©¥" ("Ik
≈ça·πÖkƒÅr") has two components. The first is ‡©ß, the digit "1" in Gurmukhi
signifying the singularity of the creator. Together the word means: "There is
only one god". It is often said that the 1430 pages of the Guru Granth Sahib
are all expansions on the Mul Mantra. Although the Sikhs have many names for
God, some derived from Islam and Hinduism, they all refer to the same Supreme
Being. Sikhs believe that God has been given many names, but they all refer to
the One God, VƒÅhiGur≈´. Sikhs believe that members of other religions such as
Islam, Hinduism and Christianity all worship the same God, and the names Allah,
Rahim, Karim, Hari, Raam and Paarbrahm are frequently mentioned in the Sikh
holy scriptures. Although there is no set reference to God in Sikhism, the most
commonly used Sikh reference to God is Akal Purakh (which means "the true
immortal") or Waheguru, the Primal Being. Iranian religions. Zoroastrianism.
Zoroastrianism idiosyncratically combines cosmogonic dualism and escathological
monotheism which makes it unique among the religions of the world.
Zoroastrianism proclaims an evolution through time from dualism to monotheism.
Zoroastrianism is a monotheistic religion (although early Zoroastrianism is
often regarded as dualist) which was once one of the largest religions on
Earth. Zoroastrianism is generally believed to have been founded around the 1st
millennium BCE. By some scholars, the Zoroastrians ("Parsis" or "Zartoshtis")
are credited with being the first monotheists and having had significant
influence in the formation of currently larger world religions. Figures put the
number of adherents at up to 3.5 million, ranging from regions in South Asia
and spread across the globe. Bah√°'√≠ Faith. God in the Bah√°'√≠ Faith is too
great for humans to fully comprehend and human primitive understanding of God
is achieved through his revelations via his divine intermediary Manifestations.
In the Bah√°'√≠ faith, such Christian doctrines as the Trinity are seen as
compromising the Bah√°'√≠ view that God is single and has no equal. And the
very existence of the Bah√°'√≠ Faith is a challenge to the Islamic doctrine of
the finality of Muhammad's revelation. God in the Bah√°'√≠ Faith communicates
to humanity through divine intermediaries, known as Manifestations of God.
These Manifestations establish religion in the world. It is through these
divine intermediaries that humans can approach God, and through them God brings
divine revelation and law. The Bah√°'√≠ view of God is monotheistic. God is the
imperishable, uncreated being who is the source of all existence. He is
described as "a personal God, unknowable, inaccessible, the source of all
Revelation, eternal, omniscient, omnipresent and almighty". Although
transcendent and inaccessible directly, his image is reflected in his creation.
The purpose of creation is for the created to have the capacity to know and
love its creator. God communicates his will and purpose to humanity through
intermediaries, known as Manifestations of God, who are the prophets and
messengers that have founded religions from prehistoric times up to the present
day. The Oneness of God is one of the core teachings of the Bah√°'√≠ Faith.
Bah√°'√≠s believe that there is one supernatural being, God, who has created
all existence. God is described as "a personal God, unknowable, inaccessible,
the source of all rvievelation, eternal, omniscient, omnipresent and almighty."
God is taught to be a personal god, too great for humans to fully understand
him. The obligatory prayers in the Bah√°'√≠ Faith involve explicit monotheistic
testimony. European religions. Hellenistic religion. "The One" (Œ§·Ω∏ ·ºùŒΩ) is
a concept that arises in Platonism, although the writings of Plato himself are
still cast in polytheistic terminology. The Euthyphro dilemma, for example, is
formulated as "Is the pious loved by the gods because it is pious, or is it
pious because it is loved by the gods?" But Plato prefigures monotheism by
looking for the absolute Truth, as in the allegory of the cave, and the
absolute Good, as in the Form of the Good. Later, Hellenistic religion,
including Hellenistic Judaism, and especially Neoplatonism, formulate
monotheism explicitly. The development of pure (philosophical) monotheism is a
product of the Late Antiquity. During the 2nd to 3rd centuries, early
Christianity was just one of several competing religious movements advocating
monotheism. A number of oracles of Apollo from Didyma and Clarus, the so-called
"theological oracles", dated to the 2nd and 3rd century CE, proclaim that there
is only one highest god, of whom the gods of polytheistic religions are mere
manifestations or servants. Similarly, the cult of Dionysus as practiced in
Cyprus seems to have developed into strict monotheism by the 4th century;
together with Mithraism and other sects the cult formed an instance of "pagan
monotheism" in direct competition with Early Christianity during Late
Antiquity. Aristotle's concept of the "Uncaused Cause" - never incorporated
into the polytheistic ancient Greek religion - has been used by many exponents
of Abrahamic religions to justify their arguments for the existence of the
Judeo-Christian-Islamic God of the Abrahamic religions. The Hypsistarians were
a religious group who believed in a most high god, according to Greek
documents. Later revisions of this Hellenic religion were adjusted towards
Monotheism as it gained consideration among a wider populace. The worship of
Zeus as the head-god signaled a trend in the direction of monotheism, with less
honour paid to the fragmented powers of the lesser gods. Abrahamic religions.
The major source of monotheism in the modern Western World is the narrative of
the Hebrew Bible, the scripture of Judaism. The text of the Bible states that
Judaism began with divine revelations from "God most high" to Abraham 14-15 and
to the people of Israel at mount Sinai 20. The understanding of the
transmitters of the biblical text was that the Bible uniformly presents one God
as creator of the world and the only power controlling history. In their
understanding, references to other "gods" are to non-existent entities or
angelic servants of God, to whom humans mistakenly ascribe reality and power.
e.g. Babylonian Talmud, Megilla 7b-17a. Early Christianity, originally one of
many sects within Judaism, emerged as a distinctive faith around the beginning
of the second century when some believe followers of Christ refused to join the
Bar Kokhba revolt. There are strong indications that the difference between the
new testament that Christians believe and Jewish covenant is one of spiritual
Life within the believer rather than ones of religious traditional difference
or historic separation. Christ's leaving of the physical temple in Jerusalem
and to establishing of God's dwelling in the spirit of man is an example of
this. Most Jews believe that Jehovah's presence dwelt in the physical temple
whereas most Christians maintain that Christ (the second of the Holy Trinity)
makes his dwelling in believers through the Holy Spirit (the third of the Holy
Trinity). Christianity's form of monotheism was distinctive from that of
Judaism in that there was a concept that the Godhead was revealed to be three
"persons" known today as the Holy Trinity. Islam emerged in the 7th century CE
as a reaction to both Christianity and Judaism, drawing from thematic elements
of Gnosticism and stating that the Christian and Jewish scriptures were
corrupted, but with a version of monotheism based on that of Judaism. Jewish
and Islamic scholars each recognize the other faith as being pure monotheists
as opposed to the rest of the world's religions having corrupt monotheism or
polytheism. Since they share a common theology, their differences are in that
Judaism sees Islam as a non-related monotheistic faith and Islam seems Judaism
as incomplete due to a lack of recognition of Jesus as the messiah and the
prophethood of Muhammad. As they traditionally profess a concept of monotheism
with a singular person as God, Judaism and Islam reject the Christian idea of
monotheism. Judaism uses the term Shituf to refer to ways of worshiping God
that Jews don't think is monotheistic. Muslims deny the Christian doctrine of
the Trinity and divinity of Jesus, considering it to be polytheism. Judaism.
The Hebrew Bible commands the Israelites not to worship other gods, but only
the God of Israel who brought them out of Egypt (Ex. 20:1-4; Deut. 5:6-7). The
concept of Yahweh enlarged through the exile of Babylon and Yahweh was
responsible for what happened to Israel. All the events and enemies around
Israel were instruments in the divine hand because Yahweh is the only God and
no other gods existed. The ancient roots of monotheistic Judaism lie in the
Bronze Age polytheistic Ancient Semitic religions, specifically Canaanite
religion, a syncretization with elements of Zoroastrianism and of the worship
of Yahweh reflected in the early prophetic books of the Hebrew Bible.¬ Both
archaeological evidence and the Biblical texts document tensions between groups
comfortable with the worship of Yahweh alongside local deities such as Asherah
and Baal and those insistent on the worship of Yahweh alone during the
monarchal period. According to the Hebrew Bible, Jerusalem was a Jebusite
fortress, conquered by the Israelites and made into their capital around 1000
BCE (Edwin R. Thiele dates David's conquest of Jerusalem to 1003 BCE).¬ As a
result, the Jebusite cult exerted considerable influence on Israelite religion.
The Jebusites observed an astral cult involving "Shalem", an astral deity
identified with the Evening star in Ugaritic mythology, besides Tzedek
"righteousness" and El Elyon, the "most high God". During the 8th century BCE,
worship of Yahweh in Israel was in competition with many other cults, described
by the Yahwist faction collectively as Baals. The oldest books of the Hebrew
Bible, written in the 8th century BCE reflect this competition, as in the books
of Hosea and Nahum, whose authors lament the "apostasy" of the people of
Israel, threatening them with the wrath of God if they do not give up their
polytheistic cults. The oldest writings of Judaism that survive directly date
from the Hellenistic period. This includes Hebrew and Aramaic papyri with
biblical fragments such as the Dead Sea Scrolls, and Greek documents such as
the Septuagint. Scholars contend that the development of a strict monotheism
was the result of cultural diffusion between Persians and Hebrews, or as a
result of the contact of Israelite and Greek cultures. The Shema. When Moses
returned with the Ten Commandments, the second of those stated that "you shall
have no other gods before me" (Exodus 20:3), right after the first, which
affirmed the existence of God. Furthermore, Israelites recite the Shema Yisrael
("Hear, O Israel") which partly says, "Hear, O Israel: YHWH is our God, YHWH is
one," meaning that Israel was to worship none of the gods of other peoples.
Monotheism was and is the central tenet of the Israelite and the Jewish
religion. In this case, "Elohim" is used in the plural as a form of respect and
not polytheism. "Gen.1:26" And Elohim said, Let "us" make man in "our" image,
after "our" likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and
over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over
every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. Elohim is morphologically
plural in form in Hebrew, but generally takes singular agreement when it refers
to the God of Israel (so the verb meaning "said" in this verse is "vayyomer"
◊ï◊ô◊ê◊û◊® with singular inflection, and not "vayyomru" ◊ï◊ô◊ê◊û◊®◊ï with
plural inflection), and yet in this case the "our" and "us" seems to create a
presumption of plurality, though it may just be God talking to angels and not
another god. Judaism, however, insists that the "Lord is One," as in the Shema,
and at least two interpretations exist to explain the Torah's use of the plural
form. The first is that the plural form "Elohim" is analogous to the royal
plural as used in English. The second is that, in order to set an example for
human kings, Elohim consulted with his court (the angels, just created) before
making a major decision (creating man). An alternative explanation by Mark S.
Smith is that the notion of divinity underwent radical changes throughout the
period of early Israelite identity. Smith has said that the ambiguity of the
term "Elohim" is the result of such changes, cast in terms of "vertical
translatability" by Smith (2008); i.e. the re-interpretation of the gods of the
earliest recalled period as the national god of the monolatrism as it emerged
in the 7th to 6th century BCE in the Kingdom of Judah and during the Babylonian
captivity, and further in terms of monotheism by the emergence of Rabbinical
Judaism in the 2nd century CE.Smith, Mark S. (2002), "The Early History of God:
Yahweh and the Other Deities in Ancient Israel" (Biblical Resource Series)
Christianity. From earlier than the times of the Nicene Creed, 325¬ CE,
Christianity advocated the triune mystery-nature of God as a normative
profession of faith. Christians have held that in scriptural references to 'God
the Father' (Philippians , 1_Peter ) 'God the Son' (John, , Hebrews ,
Colossians ) and 'God the Holy Spirit' (Acts ) are referring to or describing
the different divine persons. But they also still believe that passages of the
New Testament, such as 1 Corinthians 8:4 "... and that is none other God but
one.", and the Old Testament, such as Isaiah 45:5 "I the , and [there is none
else, is no God beside me", reveal God as being 'one'. A 2012 article in "Free
Inquiry" magazine revealed how ancient Hebrews attempted to remove polytheistic
notions from the original Hebrew scriptures, yet many remain in the Christian
Bible. The Christian notion of a triune Godhead and the doctrine of a man-god
Christ Jesus as God incarnate is rejected by adherents of Judaism and Islam.
Modern Christians, though, believe their God is triune meaning that the three
persons of the Trinity are in one union in which each person is also wholly
God. Christians also do not believe that one of the three divine figures is God
alone and the other two are not but that all three are mysteriously God and
one. Thus all three are in union as one God of one essence, and different from
many gods just as God may materialized himself in water, 'one in element' but
may be ice, water, or gas without changing its element. This analogy itself
however is not descriptive of the Holy Trinity but of Sabellianism which is one
God with different modes or "masks." Other sects like Jehovah's Witnesses and
Mormonism do not share those views on the Trinity. Historically, most Christian
churches have taught that the nature of God is a "mystery", in the original,
technical meaning; something that must be revealed by special revelation rather
than deduced through general revelation. Among early Christians there was
considerable debate over the nature of Godhead, with some denying the
incarnation but not the deity of Jesus (Docetism) and others later calling for
an Arian conception of God. Despite at least one earlier local synod rejecting
the claim of Arius, this Christological issue was to be one of the items
addressed at the First Council of Nicaea. However, some Christian faiths such
as Mormonism argue that the Godhead is in-fact three separate individuals which
include; God the Father, God the Son (Jesus Christ), and God the Holy Ghost.
Each individual having a distinct purpose in the grand existence of human kind.
Furthermore, Mormons believe that before the "Council of Nicaea," the
predominant belief among many early Christians was that the Godhead was three
separate individuals. Mormons look to the New Testament for proof of this
doctrinal belief such as in John 17:3, "And this is life eternal, that they
might know Thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent."
Later on Christ prays in John 17:21, "That they all may be one; as thou,
Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the
world may believe that thou hast sent me." Clarifying that Jesus Christ is not
in God physically but that they are one in purpose; which purpose is to bring
to pass the immortality and eternal life of man. Finally, in the last moments
of Jesus Christ's mortal existence, Jesus prays to the Father, "Father, why
hast Thou forsaken me?" This statement reflecting the supposed reality that
Christ is a distinct separate individual who sought for help from His Father in
Heaven in Christ greatest hour of need. The First Council of Nicaea, held in
Nicaea in Nicaea (in present-day Turkey), convoked by the Roman Emperor
Constantine I in 325, was the first ecumenical council of bishops of the Roman
Empire, and most significantly resulted in the first uniform Christian
doctrine, called the Nicene Creed. With the creation of the creed, a precedent
was established for subsequent 'general (ecumenical) councils of bishops'
(synods) to create statements of belief and canons of doctrinal orthodoxy‚Äî
the intent being to define unity of beliefs for the Church and addressheresies
ideas. One purpose of the council was to resolve disagreements in Alexandria
over the nature of Jesus in relationship to the Father; in particular, whether
Jesus was of the same substance as God the Father or merely of similar
substance. All but two bishops took the first position; while Arius' argument
failed. Christian orthodox traditions (Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox,
Roman Catholic, and most Protestants) follow this decision, which was
reaffirmed in 381 at the First Council of Constantinople and reached its full
development through the work of the Cappadocian Fathers. They consider God to
be a triune entity, called the Trinity, comprising the three "persons" God the
Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit, the three of this unity are
described as being "of the same substance" (). Christians overwhelmingly assert
that monotheism is central to the Christian faith, as the Nicene Creed (and
others), which gives the orthodox Christian definition of the Trinity, begins:
"I believe in one God". Deism is a philosophy of religion which arises in the
Christian tradition during the Early Modern period. It postulates that there is
a God who however does not intervene in human affairs. Unitarianism is a
Christological doctrine in contrast with Trinitarian Christianity, postulating
that Jesus was completely human messiah. Islam. In Islam, AllƒÅh (God) is all-
powerful and all-knowing, the creator, sustainer, ordainer and judge of the
universe. God in Islam is strictly singular ("tawhid") unique ("wahid") and
inherently One ("ahad"), all-merciful and omnipotent. AllƒÅh exists without
place and the Qur'an states that "No vision can grasp Him, but His grasp is
over all vision. God is above all comprehension, yet is acquainted with all
things" (Qur'an 6:103) AllƒÅh is the only God and the same God worshiped in
Christianity and Judaism. (). The Qur'an asserts the existence of a single and
absolute truth that transcends the world; a unique and indivisible being who is
independent of the creation. The Qur'an rejects binary modes of thinking such
as the idea of a duality of God by arguing that both good and evil generate
from God's creative act. God is a universal god rather than a local, tribal or
parochial one; an absolute who integrates all affirmative values and brooks no
evil. "Tawhid" constitutes the foremost article of the Muslim profession of
faith, "There is no god but God, Muhammad is the messenger of God. To attribute
divinity to a created entity is the only unpardonable sin mentioned in the
Qur'an. Muslims believe that the entirety of the Islamic teaching rests on the
principle of "tawhid". As they traditionally profess a concept of monotheism
with a singular person as God, Judaism and Islam reject the Christian idea of
monotheism. Judaism uses the term Shituf to refer to ways of worshiping God
that Jews don't think is monotheistic. Muslims deny the Christian doctrine of
the Trinity and divinity of Jesus, construing it to be "shirk". Sabianism.
According to the Qur'an, the Sabians were an Abrahamic religious group. The
Hadith accounts them as converts to Islam, while their identity in later
Islamic literature became a matter of discussion and investigation. Chinese
view. Worship of "Shangdi" and Heaven in ancient China includes the erection of
shrines, the last and greatest being the Temple of Heaven in Beijing, and the
offering of prayers. The ruler of China in every Chinese dynasty would perform
annual sacrificial rituals to "Shangdi", usually by slaughtering a completely
healthy bull as sacrifice. Although its popularity gradually diminished after
the advent of Taoism and Buddhism, among other religions, its concepts remained
in use throughout the pre-modern period and have been incorporated in later
religions in China, including terminology used by early Christians in China.
Despite the rising of non-theistic and pantheistic spirituality contributed by
Taoism and Buddhism, Shangdi was still praised up until the end of the Qing
Dynasty, surprisingly as the last ruler of Qing declared himself son of heaven,
literally son of God. Islam and Christianity became the forerunners of
Monotheism in China there on. The 100-word eulogy written by the founder of the
Ming dynasty states his comment on Islam. Tengriism. Originally shamanistic
practices that have over time may once have been monotheistic later once since
deification of an Earth Mother to the Sky father as a Duality, also including
ancestor worship and an addition for a "sun deity", polytheizing the religion
and more deities were incorporated after-wards. Tengri may have been synonymous
with "Tian" in Chinese traditions as well as a possible fore-runner to pre-
Buddhist Tibetan B√∂n, also having their tradition root from Siberia, once sect
ranging from monotheism, again branches off into animism, causing an ill-
defined complex systematized religion. At its monotheistic state, it was the
major religion among the Nomadic Empires of Eurasia. Until the rise of
Christianity, Islam and Tibetan Buddhism, the religion largely ceased,
especially Buddhism which the rejection of a creator god, Tengri has been
heavily diminished or clove in such communities. It is relatively unsure what
sect of Tengriism was practiced by the Nomadic Empires as some would worship a
single sky god while others would worship partners with the god such as the
additional deities. It has been noted that Atilla the Hun of the Hunnic Empire
was a pagan according to Roman records, however it is also thought that
monotheistic Tengriism was practiced by the Mongolian Empire before the advent
of Buddhism which explicitly rejected a creator god. In Sino-Tibetan and Turco-
Mongol traditions, the Supreme God is commonly referred to as the ruler of
Heaven, or the Sky Lord granted with omnipotent powers, but it has largely
diminished in those regions due to ancestor worship, Taoism's pantheistic views
and Buddhism's rejection of a creator God, although Mahayana Buddhism does seem
to keep a sense of divinity. On some occasions in the mythology, the Sky Lord
as identified as a male has been associated to mate with an Earth Mother, while
some traditions kept the omnipotence of the Sky Lord unshared. New religious
movements. Various New religious movements, such as Cao ƒê√ i, Tenrikyo, and
Cheondoism, are monotheistic.
