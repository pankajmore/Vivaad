Religion and homosexuality The relationship between religion and homosexuality
can vary greatly across time and place, within and between different religions
and sects, and regarding different forms of homosexuality and bisexuality.
Present day doctrines of the world's major religions vary vastly generally and
by denomination on attitudes toward these sexual orientations. Among those
sects that generally are negative towards these orientations, there are many
different types of actions they may take: this can range from quietly
discouraging homosexual activity, explicitly forbidding same-sex sexual
practices among adherents and actively opposing social acceptance of
homosexuality, to execution. Many argue that it is homosexual actions which are
sinful, rather than the state of being homosexual itself. Several organizations
exist that assert that conversion therapy can help diminish same-sex
attraction. However within many religions there are also people who view the
two sexual orientations positively, and many religious denominations may bless
same-sex marriages and support LGBT rights, and the amount of those that do are
continuously increasing around the world as much of the developed world enacts
laws supporting LGBT rights. Historically, some cultures and religions
accommodated, institutionalized, or revered, same-sex love and sexuality; such
mythologies and traditions can be found around the world. For example, Hinduism
does not view homosexuality as a religious sin. In 2009, The United Kingdom
Hindu Council became one of the first major religious organizations to support
LGBT rights when they issued a statement ""Hinduism does not condemn
homosexuality"". Regardless of their position on homosexuality, many people of
faith look to both sacred texts and tradition for guidance on this issue.
However, the authority of various traditions or scriptural passages and the
correctness of translations and interpretations are continually disputed. Views
of specific religious groups. Abrahamic religions. The Abrahamic religions of
Judaism, Christianity and Islam, have traditionally forbidden sodomy, believing
and teaching that such behavior is sinful. Today some denominations within
these religions are accepting of homosexuality and inclusive of homosexual
people, such as Reform Judaism, the United Church of Christ and the
Metropolitan Community Church. Some Presbyterian and Anglican churches welcome
members regardless of same-sex sexual practices, with some provinces allowing
for the ordination and inclusion of gay and lesbian clerics, and affirmation of
same-sex unions. Reform Judaism incorporates lesbian and gay rabbis and same-
sex marriage liturgies, while Reconstructionist Judaism and Conservative
Judaism in the USA allows for lesbian and gay rabbis and same-sex unions.
Judaism. The Torah (first five books of the Hebrew Bible) is the primary source
for Jewish views on homosexuality. It states that: "man shall not lie with
another man as would with a woman, it is a ×ª×•×¢×‘×” "toeba" ("abomination")"
(Leviticus 18:22). (Like many similar commandments, the stated punishment for
willful violation is the death penalty, although in practice rabbinic Judaism
no longer believes it has the authority to implement death penalties.) Orthodox
Judaism views homosexual acts as sinful. Conservative Judaism has engaged in an
in-depth study of homosexuality since the 1990s with various rabbis presenting
a wide array of responsa (papers with legal arguments) for communal
consideration. The official position of the movement is to welcome homosexual
Jews into their synagogues, and also campaign against any discrimination in
civil law and public society, but also to uphold a ban on homosexual sex as a
religious requirement. Reform Judaism and Reconstructionist Judaism in North
America and Liberal Judaism in the United Kingdom view homosexuality to be
acceptable on the same basis as heterosexuality. Progressive Jewish authorities
believe either that traditional laws against homosexuality are no longer
binding or that they are subject to changes that reflect a new understanding of
human sexuality. Some of these authorities rely on modern biblical scholarship
suggesting that the prohibition in the Torah was intended to ban coercive or
ritualized homosexual sex, such as those practices ascribed to Egyptian and
Canaanite fertility cults and temple prostitution. Christianity. Christian
denominations hold a variety of views on the issue of homosexual activity,
ranging from outright condemnation to complete acceptance. Most Christian
denominations welcome people attracted to the same sex, but teach that
homosexual acts are sinful. These denominations include the Roman Catholic
Church, the Eastern Orthodox church, the Methodist Church, and some other
mainline denominations, such as the Reformed Church in America and the American
Baptist Church, as well as Conservative Evangelical organizations and churches,
such as the Evangelical Alliance, and fundamentalist groups and churches, such
as the Southern Baptist Convention. Pentecostal churches such as the Assemblies
of God, as well as Restorationist churches, like Jehovah's Witnesses and
Mormons, also take the position that homosexual sexual activity is sinful. Some
liberal Christians are supportive of homosexuals. Other Christian denominations
do not view monogamous same sex relationships as bad or evil. These include the
United Church of Canada, the United Church of Christ, the Episcopal Church, the
Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and
the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada. In particular, the Metropolitan
Community Church, a denomination of 40,000 members, was founded specifically to
serve the Christian LGBT community, and is devoted to being open and affirming
to LGBT people. The United Church of Christ and the Alliance of Baptists also
condone gay marriage, and some parts of the Anglican and Lutheran churches
allow for the blessing of gay unions. Within the Anglican communion there are
openly gay clergy; for example, Gene Robinson and Mary Glasspool are openly
homosexual bishops in the US Episcopal Church and Eva Brunne in Lutheran Church
of Sweden. The Episcopal Church's recent actions vis-a-vis homosexuality have
brought about increased ethical debate and tension within the Church of England
and worldwide Anglican churches. Passages from the Old Testament have been
interpreted to argue that homosexuals should be punished with death, and AIDS
has been portrayed by some fundamentalist sects such as Fred Phelps and Jerry
Falwell as a punishment by God against homosexuals. In the 20th century,
theologians like Karl Barth, JÃ¼rgen Moltmann, Hans KÃ¼ng, John Robinson,
Bishop David Jenkins, Don Cupitt, Bishop Jack Spong challenged traditional
theological positions and understandings of the Bible; following these
developments some have suggested that passages have been mistranslated, are
taken out of context, or that they do not refer to what we understand as
"homosexuality." Some Protestant churches condemn same-sex sexual relations,
based on scripture texts such as describing a man lying with another man as
sinful acts. Where the Catholic view is founded on a natural law argument
informed by scripture and proposed by Thomas Aquinas, the traditional
conservative Protestant view is based on an interpretation of scripture alone.
Protestant conservatives also see homosexual relationships as an impediment to
heterosexual relationships. They interpret some Biblical passages to be
commandments to be heterosexually married. Catholics, on the other hand, have
accommodated unmarried people as priests, monks, nuns and single lay people for
over a thousand years. A number of self-described gay and ex-gay Christians
have reported satisfaction in mixed-orientation marriages. Catholic Church. The
Catholic Church insists that those who are attracted to people of the same sex
as well as anyone who is not married practice chastity. The Catholic Church
does not regard homosexual activity as a perfect expression of the marital act
which it teaches is only possible within a lifelong commitment of a marriage
between a man and a woman. According to the Church's sexual ethics, homosexual
activity falls short in the areas complementarity (male and female organs
complement each other) and fecundity (openness to new life) of the sexual act.
This is not to be seen as a fault of people with homosexual attraction, but
rather Catholic church officials puport that this is a statement of fact about
reality. Mormonism. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints teaches
that no one should arouse sexual feelings outside of marriage, including those
towards that same sex, and that these feelings should be overcome through self-
control and reliance on the atonement of Jesus Christ. The church teaches that
marriage is between a man and a woman, and is essential to God's eternal plan.
Islam. All major Islamic schools disapprove of homosexuality, Islam views same-
sex desires as a natural temptation; but, sexual relations are seen as a
transgression of the natural role and aim of sexual activity. Islamic teachings
(in the "hadith" tradition) presume same-sex attraction, extol abstention and
(in the Qur'an) condemn consummation. The discourse on homosexuality in Islam
is primarily concerned with activities between men. There are, however, a few
hadith mentioning homosexual behavior in women; The fuqahaâ€™ are agreed that
there is no hadd punishment for lesbianism, because it is not zina. Rather a
taâ€™zeer punishment must be imposed, because it is a sin..'". Relations
between women, if they are regarded as problems, are treated akin to adultery,
and al-Tabari records an execution of a harem couple under Caliph al-Hadi.
Islam allows and promotes filial love between siblings of the same sex.
However, sexual activities between them are totally prohibited. Ibn Hazm, Ibn
Daud, Al-Mutamid, Abu Nuwas and many others used this edict to write
extensively and openly of brotherly love between men while proclaiming to be
chaste. BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith. BahÃ¡'Ã­ law limits permissible sexual relations to
those between a man and a woman in marriage. Believers are expected to abstain
from sex outside matrimony. BahÃ¡'Ã­s do not, however, attempt to impose their
moral standards on those who have not accepted the Revelation of
BahÃ¡â€™uâ€™llÃ¡h. While requiring uprightness in all matters of morality,
whether sexual or otherwise, the BahÃ¡â€™Ã­ teachings also take account of
human frailty and call for tolerance and understanding in regard to human
failings. In this context, to regard homosexuals with prejudice would be
contrary to the spirit of the BahÃ¡â€™Ã­ teachings. Indian religions. Among the
religions that originated in India, including Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and
Sikhism, teachings regarding homosexuality are less clear than among the
Abrahamic traditions, and religious authorities voice diverse opinions. In
2005, an authority figure of Sikhism condemned same-sex marriage and the
practice of homosexuality. However many people in Sikhism aren't against gay
marriage. Hinduism is diverse, with no supreme governing body, but the majority
of swamis opposed same-sex relationships in a 2004 survey, and a minority
supported them. Ancient religious texts such as the Vedas often refer to people
of a third gender known as hijra, who are neither female nor male. Some see
this third gender as an ancient parallel to modern western lesbian, gay,
bisexual, transgender and/or intersex identities. However, this third sex is
usually negatively valued as a pariah class in ancient texts. Ancient Hindu law
books, from the first century onward, categorize non-vaginal sex ("ayoni") as
impure. Hinduism. Hinduism has taken various positions, ranging from positive
to neutral or discouraging. Homosexuality is regarded as one of the possible
expressions of human desire and Hindu mythic stories have portrayed homosexual
experience as natural and joyful. There are several Hindu temples which have
carvings that depict both men and women indulging in homosexual sex. Rigveda,
one of the four canonical sacred texts of Hinduism says 'Vikruti Evam Prakriti'
(diversity is what nature is all about, or, what seems un-natural is also
natural), which some scholars believe recognizes homosexuality as natural, if
not an approval of homosexuality. Moreover, Rigveda recognizes the cyclical
constancy of homosexual/transsexual dimensions of human life, like all forms of
universal diversities. However, sexuality is rarely discussed openly in Hindu
society today, and homosexuality is largely a taboo subjectÂ â€” especially
among the strongly religious. In a 2004 survey, most swamis said they opposed
the concept of a Hindu-sanctified gay marriage. Some of the law codes, such as
that of Manu Smriti assert that a woman "polluting" a virgin is a crime.
Punishments include ritual baths, fines, public humiliation and having fingers
cut off. However, the bulk of sexual matters dealt with by the law books are
heterosexual in nature. A "third gender" has been acknowledged within Hinduism
since Vedic times. Several Hindu texts, such as Manu Smriti and Sushruta
Samhita, assert that some people are born with either mixed male and female
natures, or sexually neuter, as a matter of natural biology. They worked as
hairdressers, flower-sellers, servants, masseurs and prostitutes. Today, many
people of a "third gender" (hijras) live throughout India, mostly on the
margins of society, and many still work in prostitution, or make a livelihood
as beggars. The Indian Kama Sutra, written in the 4th century AD, contains
passages describing eunuchs or "third-sex" males performing oral sex on men.
However, the author was "not a fan of homosexual activities" and treated such
individuals with disdain, according to historian Devdutt Pattanaik. Similarly,
some medieval Hindu temples and artifacts openly depict male homosexuality,
lesbianism, and bisexuality within their carvings, such as the temple walls at
Khajuraho. Some infer from these images that Hindu society and religion were
previously more open to variations in human sexuality than they are at present.
Hindu scriptures contain several stories that metaphorically have homosexual,
bisexual, transgender, or other kinds of queer overtones, often involving the
most prominent Hindu deities. There are Hindu deities who are intersex (both
male and female), e.g., Ardhanari, who is the unified form of Shiva and
Parvati; who switch from male to female or from female to male, e.g., Mohini,
who is the only female Avatar of Vishnu; male deities with female moods and
female deities with male moods, e.g., Krishna turning into Mohini to fulfil
Iravan's boon; deities born from two males or from two females, e.g., Ayyappan,
who is considered to be "Harihara Putra", the son of Shiva and Vishnu, in his
Mohini Avatar, and so on. Jainism. Chastity is one of the five virtues in the
fundamental ethical code of Jainism. For laypersons, the only appropriate
avenue for sexuality is within marriage, and homosexuality is believed to lead
to negative karma because the sexual act is outside marriage. Jain author Duli
Chandra Jain wrote in 2004 that homosexuality and transvestism "stain one's
thoughts and feelings" because they involve sexual passion. Some texts in
Jainism have depicted of Eunuchs are born with genetic defects or due to social
pressure. There is also a mention of correction and lead normal life. It is a
mental imbalance which can be cured in few of the cases. (Brhatkalpa bhasya V,
517374.) The liberal humanitarian attitude of the Jaina society in the
formulation of rules and their exceptions is evidenced in the case of the
enunuch (who is considered to be female) who was raped by unknown man. Such a
eunuch was kept in the monastery was well looked after, was fed by nuns and
when well advanced in pregnancy was handed over to a devoted physician. All her
duties as a person were suspended till her child sucked her; even her child
could be initiated. One particularly remarkable aspect was that those who
teased or condemned her were compelled to undergo expiatory punishment. (Brh.
kalp. Bha., 4129-46). Buddhism. The most common formulation of Buddhist ethics
are the Five Precepts and the Eightfold Path, one should neither be attached to
nor crave sensual pleasure. The third of the Five Precepts is "To refrain from
committing sexual misconduct. However, the "sexual misconduct" is such a broad
term, and is subjected to interpretation relative to the social norms of the
followers. In fact, Buddhism in its fundamental form does not define what is
right and what is wrong in absolute terms for lay followers. Therefore the
determination of whether or not homosexuality is acceptable for a layperson is
not a religious matter as far as fundamental Buddhism is concerned. Buddhism is
often characterized as distrustful of sensual enjoyment and sexuality in
general. Traditionally, homosexual conduct and gender variance are seen as
obstacles to spiritual progress in most schools of Buddhism; as such monks are
expected to refrain from all sexual activity, and the Vinaya (the first book of
the Tripitaka) specifically prohibits sexual intercourse, then further explain
that both anal, oral as well as vaginal intercourse amount to sexual
intercourse, which will result in permanent exclusion from Sangha. A notable
exception in the history of Buddhism occurred in Japan during the Edo period,
in which male homosexuality, or more specifically, love between young novices
and older monks, was celebrated. References to "pandaka", a deviant sex/gender
category that is usually interpreted to include homosexual males, can be found
throughout the Pali canon as well as other Sanskrit scriptures. Leonard
Zwilling refers extensively to Buddhaghosa's Samantapasadika, where "pandaka"
are described as being filled with defiled passions and insatiable lusts, and
are dominated by their libido. The Abhidharma states that a "pandaka" cannot
achieve enlightenment in their own lifetime, but must wait for rebirth as a
"normal" man or woman. According to one scriptural story, Anandaâ€”Buddha's
cousin and discipleâ€”was a "pandaka" in one of his many previous lives. The
third of the Five Precepts of Buddhism states that one is to refrain from
sexual misconduct; this precept has sometimes been interpreted to include
homosexuality. The Dalai Lama of Tibetan Buddhism interprets sexual misconduct
to include lesbian and gay sex, and indeed any sex other than penis-vagina
intercourse, including oral sex, anal sex, and masturbation or other sexual
activity with the hand; the only time sex is acceptable is when it performed
for its natural purpose of procreation. However, the Dalai Lama supports human
rights for all, "regardless of sexual orientation." In Thailand, traditional
accounts propose that "homosexuality arises as a karmic consequence of
violating Buddhist proscriptions against heterosexual misconduct. These karmic
accounts describe homosexuality as a congenital condition which cannot be
altered, at least in a homosexual person's current lifetime, and have been
linked with calls for compassion and understanding from the non-homosexual
populace." However, Buddhist leaders in Thailand have also condemned
homosexuality, ousted monks accused of homosexual acts, and banned kathoey from
ordination. As per BBC article April 27, 2009, Senior monk Phra Maha Wudhijaya
Vajiramedh is very concerned by flamboyant behavior of gay and transgender
novices such as the wearing of make-up and tight or revealingly tight robes,
carrying pink purses and having effeminately-shaped eyebrows. Phra Vajiramedhi
acknowledged that it was difficult to exclude them from the monkhood - so he
introduced Thailand's & Buddhism's "good manners" curriculum - the country's
first. Within Japanese traditions, there is a widespread forklore that
homosexuality was "invented" by the Bodhisattva Manjusri of wisdom and the sage
KÅ«kai, the founder of Buddhism in Japan. Japanese Buddhist scholar and author
of "Wild Azaleas" Kitamura Kigin said that heterosexuality was to be avoided
for priests and homosexuality encouraged. Sikhism. Sikhism has no written view
on the matter, but in 2005, a Sikh religious authority described homosexuality
as "against the Sikh religion and the Sikh code of conduct and totally against
the laws of nature," and called on Sikhs to support laws against gay marriage.
Many Sikhs are against this view, however, and state that the Sikh Scriptures
promote equality and do not condemn homosexuality. Zoroastrianism. The
Vendidad, one of the later Zoroastrian texts composed in the Artificial Young
Avestan language, has not been dated precisely. It is thought that some
concepts of law, uncleanliness, dualism, and salvation were shared between the
religions, and subsequent interactions between the religions are documented by
events such as the release of the Jews from the Babylonian captivity by
Zoroastrian Cyrus the Great in 537 BC, and the Biblical account of the Magi
visiting the infant Jesus. The Vendidad generally promotes procreation: "the
man who has a wife is far above him who lives in continence; he who keeps a
house is far above him who has none; he who has children is far above the
childless man; he who has riches is far above him who has none." It details the
penance for a worshipper who submits to sodomy under force as "Eight hundred
stripes with the Aspahe-astra, eight hundred stripes with the Sraosho-charana."
(equal to the penalty for breaking a contract with the value of an ox), and
declares that for those participating voluntarily "For that deed there is
nothing that can pay, nothing that can atone, nothing that can cleanse from it;
it is a trespass for which there is no atonement, for ever and ever". However,
those not practicing the Religion of Mazda were pardoned for past actions upon
conversion. Chinese religions. Among the Taoic religions of East Asia, such as
Taoism, passionate homosexual expression is usually discouraged because it is
believed to not lead to human fulfillment. Confucianism. Confucianism, being
primarily a social and political philosophy, focused little on sexuality,
whether homosexual or heterosexual. However, the ideology did emphasize male
friendships, and Louis Crompton has argued that the "closeness of the master-
disciple bond it fostered may have subtly facilitated homosexuality".
Homosexuality is not mentioned in the Analects of Confucius. "Biting the bitter
peel", a euphemism for homosexual relations, generally taken to mean anal sex,
is mentioned as having been practiced by several individuals in the Classic of
History as well as the Spring and Autumn Annals, both texts belonging to the
Five Classics. Taoism. There is no single official position on homosexuality in
Taoism, as the term Taoism is used to describe a number of disparate religious
traditions. Homosexuality is not unknown in Taoist history, such as during the
Tang dynasty when Taoist nuns exchanged love poems. Attitudes to homosexuality
within Taoism often reflect the values and sexual norms of broader Chinese
society (see Homosexuality in China.) Neopagan religion. Wicca. The Wiccan
"Charge of the Goddess", one of the most famous texts in Neopaganism, states in
the words of the Goddess, "all acts of love and pleasure are my rituals". In
traditional forms of Wicca, such as Gardnerian and Alexandrian Wicca, magic is
often performed between a man and a woman, and the "Great Rite" is a sex ritual
performed between a Priest and Priestess representing the God and Goddess;
however, this is not generally seen as excluding homosexuals or magic between
same-sex couples. Most groups still insist, however, that initiations be
conferred from man to woman or woman to man. Any ritual sexual acts, whether
actual or symbolic, take place between two consenting adults, normally a couple
who are already lovers. See also LGBT topics and Wicca. Satanism. Satanism, in
the LaVey tradition, is open to all forms of sexual expression, and does not
preclude homosexuality. Satanism, in Spiritual traditions are also open to all
forms of sexual expression. Unitarian Universalism. The Unitarian Universalist
Association supports the freedom to marry and compares resistance to it to the
resistance to abolition of slavery, women's suffrage, and the end of anti-
miscegenation laws. Several congregations have undertaken a series of
organizational, procedural and practical steps to become acknowledged as a
"Welcoming Congregation": a congregation which has taken specific steps to
welcome and integrate gay, lesbian, bisexual & transgender (GLBT) members. UU
ministers perform same-sex unions and now same-sex marriages where legal (and
sometimes when not, as a form of civil protest). On June 29, 1984, the
Unitarian Universalists became the first major church "to approve religious
blessings on homosexual unions." Unitarian Universalists have been in the
forefront of the work to make same-sex marriages legal in their local states
and provinces, as well as on the national level. Gay men and lesbians are also
regularly ordained as ministers, and a number of gay and lesbian ministers
have, themselves, now become legally married to their partners. In May 2004,
Arlington Street Church was the site of the first state-sanctioned same-sex
marriage in the United States. The official stance of the UUA is for the
legalization of same-sex marriageâ€”"Standing on the Side of Love." In 2004 UU
Minister Rev. Debra Haffner of The Religious Institute on Sexual Morality,
Justice, and Healing published An Open Letter on Religious Leaders on Marriage
Equality to affirm same-sex marriage from a multi-faith perspective. Queer
religions. Radical Faeries. The Radical Faeries are a worldwide queer spiritual
movement, founded in 1979 in the United States. Religious groups and public
policy. Opposition to same-sex marriage and LGBT rights is often associated
with conservative religious views. The American Family Association and other
religious groups have promoted boycotts of corporations whose policies support
the LGBT community. In conservative Islamic nations, laws generally prohibit
same-sex sexual behaviour, and interpretation of Sharia Law on male
homosexuality carries the death penalty. This has been condemned as a violation
of human rights by human rights organisation Amnesty International and by the
writers of the Yogyakarta principles. With the signature of the USA in 2009,
the proposed UN declaration on LGBT rights has now been signed by every
European secular state and all western nations, as well as other countriesâ€”67
members of the UN in total. An opposing statement put forward by Muslim nations
was signed by 57 member states, mostly in Africa and Asia. 68 out of the total
192 countries have not yet signed either statement. In 2011 the United Nations
Human Rights Council passed a landmark resolution initiated by South Africa
supporting LBGT rights ("See Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity at the
United Nations")
