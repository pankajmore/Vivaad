Holy Living and Holy Dying Holy Living and Holy Dying is the collective title
of two books of Christian devotion by Jeremy Taylor. They were originally
published as "The Rules and Exercises of Holy Living", 1650 and "The Rules and
Exercises of Holy Dying", 1651. The two books represent one of the high points
of English prose during the period of the early Stuarts. According to historian
Nancy Lee Beaty (1970, "The Craft of Dying: A Study in the Literary Tradition
of the Ars Moriendi in England"), "Holy Dying" was the "artistic climax" of a
consolatory death literature tradition that had begun with "Ars moriendi" in
the 15th century. Other works in this tradition include "The Waye of Dying
Well" and "The Sick Mannes Salve". "Holy Living" is designed to instruct the
reader in living a virtuous life, increasing personal piety, and avoiding
temptations. "Holy Dying" is meant to instruct the reader in the "means and
instruments" of preparing for a blessed death. Each book contains discussions
of theology, moral instruction, often prefaced as "The Consideration reduc'd to
practise," and model prayers requesting divine assistance in achieving them.
Taylor's work was much admired by John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, for
its devotional quality; and by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Thomas de Quincey, and
Edmund Gosse for its literary qualities.
