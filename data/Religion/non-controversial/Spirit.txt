Spirit The English word spirit (from Latin "spiritus" "breath") has many
differing meanings and connotations, most of them relating to a non-corporeal
substance contrasted with the material body. The word spirit is often used
metaphysically to refer to the consciousness or personality. The notions of a
person's "spirit" and "soul" often also overlap, as both contrast with body and
both are understood as surviving the bodily death in religion and occultism,
and "spirit" can also have the sense of "ghost", i.e. a manifestation of the
spirit of a deceased person. The term may also refer to any incorporeal or
immaterial being, such as demons or deities, in Christianity specifically the
Holy Spirit (though with a capital "S") experienced by the disciples at
Pentecost. Etymology. The English word spirit comes from the Latin "spiritus",
meaning "breath", but also "spirit, soul, courage, vigor", ultimately from a
Proto-Indo-European "*(s)peis". It is distinguished from Latin "anima", "soul"
(which nonetheless also derives from an Indo-European root meaning "to
breathe", earliest form "*h2enh1-" ). In Greek, this distinction exists between
"pneuma" (Ï€Î½ÎµÏ…Î¼Î±), "breath, motile air, spirit," and "psykhÄ“"
(ÏˆÏ…Ï‡Î·), "soul" (even though the latter term, Ïˆá¿¡Ï‡Î® = "psykhÄ“/
psÅ«khÄ“", is also from an Indo-European root meaning "to breathe": *bhes-,
zero grade *bhs- devoicing in proto-Greek to *phs-, resulting in historical-
period Greek ps- in psÅ«khein, "to breathe", whence psÅ«khÄ“, "spirit",
"soul"). The word "spirit" came into Middle English via Old French. The
distinction between soul and spirit also developed in the Abrahamic religions:
Arabic "nafs" (Ù†ÙØ³) opposite "rÃºÄ§" (Ø±ÙˆØ­); Hebrew "neshama"
(× Ö°×©Ö¸××Ö¸×” "nÉ™Å¡Ã¢mÃ¢h") or "nephesh" (in Hebrew "neshama" comes from
the root "NÅ M" or "breath") opposite "ruach" (×¨×•Ö¼×—Ö· "rÃ»aÄ§"). (Note,
however, that in Semitic just as in Indo-European, this dichotomy has not
"always" been as neat historically as it has come to be taken over a long
period of development: Both × Ö¶Ö«×¤Ö¶×©× (root × ×¤×©×) and ×¨×•Ö¼×—Ö· (root
×¨×•×—), as well as cognate words in various Semitic languages, including
Arabic, also preserve meanings involving misc. air phenomena: "breath", "wind",
and even "odour".) Metaphysical and metaphorical uses. English-speakers use the
word "spirit" in two related contexts, one metaphysical and the other
metaphorical. Metaphorical usage. "See" soul "and" ghost "and" spiritual "for
related discussions". Related concepts in other languages. Similar concepts in
other languages include Greek "pneuma" and Sanskrit "akasha/atman"; "see also"
Prana. Some languages use a word for "spirit" often closely related (if not
synonymous) to "mind". Examples include the German, "Geist" (related to the
English word "ghost") or the French, 'l'esprit'. English versions of the
Judaeo-Christian Bible most commonly translate the Hebrew word "ruach" (×¨×•×—;
"wind") as "the spirit", whose essence is divine (see Holy Spirit and "ruach
hakodesh"). Alternatively, Hebrew texts commonly use the word "nephesh".
Kabbalists regard "nephesh" as one of the five parts of the Jewish soul, where
"nephesh" (animal) refers to the physical being and its animal instincts.
Similarly, Scandinavian languages, Baltic languages, Slavic languages and the
Chinese language ("qi") use the words for "breath" to express concepts similar
to "the spirit".
