Economics of religion The economics of religion or, especially in sociology,
religious economy applies socio-economic theory and methods to explain the
religious behavioral patterns of individuals, groups or cultures and the social
consequences of such behavior. An example of the first is Adam Smith's analysis
of the effect of competition and government regulation (or support) for
religious denominations on the quantity and quality of religious services.Â Â

field applies rational choice theory to the theory of religion such that supply
and demand are used to model the development and success of organized
religions. Major proponents of the theory include William Sims Bainbridge,
Roger Finke, Laurence Iannaccone, Rodney Stark and R. Stephen Warner. Religious
economy may also refer to religious persons and organizations interacting
within a market framework of competing groups and ideologies. An economy makes
it possible for religious suppliers to meet the demands of different religious
consumers. By offering an array of religions and religious products, a
competitive religious economy stimulates such activity in a market-type
setting. Religious (or theological) economics is a related subject sometimes
overlapping or conflated with the economics of religion. It uses religious
principles to evaluate economic perspectives or vice versa.Â Â  â€¢ Paul

"theory of religious economy" arises from the application of fundamental
principles of economics to the analysis of religious organizations. Just as
commercial economies consist of a market in which different firms compete,
religious economies consist of a market (the aggregate demand for religion) and
firms (different religious organizations) seeking to attract and hold clients.
The theory of religious economy was developed to explain why and how religions
change. Market situation. According to the theory, religious pluralism gives
the population a wide variety of choices in religion and leads to a religious
economy in which different religious organizations compete for followers, much
the way businesses compete for consumers in a commercial economy. The Theory of
Religious Economy takes into account a wide spectrum of issues (e.g., the
differences between competitive religious markets and religious monopolies),
making this theory one of the most significant developments in the social
scientific study of religion during the past thirty years. The theory focuses
attention on religious suppliers and whether religious firms have the ability
to increase the demand for religion. In a free market, or pluralistic religious
market, many religious organizations exist and seek to appeal to certain
segments of the market. Organizations in a free market cannot rely on the state
for resources so they must compete for participation of the religious consumer.
Contest among religious firms results in the specialization of products so that
consumers are able to distinguish different organization from others(Chesnut).
Pluralistic religions operate on a personal scale, marketing more to individual
demands as opposed to public. As the majority of the consumer market,
organizations market more to women than men. Pluralism is only possible through
lack of favoritism by the state.(Chesnut) A competitive and pluralistic
religious economy has a positive effect on levels of participation. A
microeconomic theory of the household production function and time allocation
is associated with the work of Chicago economist Gary Becker.Â Â  â€¢ _____,
1973. "A Theory of Marriage: Part I." "Journal of Political Economy", 81(4),
pp. 813-846. An influential approach dating from the 1970s adapts that theory
to explain religious participation and a resulting formation of norms. It
postulates stable preferences and rational choice constrained by limited human
and social capital to explain behavior.Â Â  â€¢ Ronald G. Ehrenberg, 1977.

47-67. As in economics, the market situation can be described with concepts
about monopoly, prohibition, and pluralism. Monopolies in religion are only
made possible through state enforcement and often function on a public scale.
When the government establishes a set religion and all other competition is
drowned out then "believers are culturally connected but not necessarily
spiritually"(Andrew Chesnut) to the religion enforced by the state. Since
participation in a religious monopoly is not as important because the church
does not have to rely on members for resources they are not forced to provide
adequate or marketable "religious products"(Chesnut), due to lack of
competition. The ability of a religious organization to monopolize a religious
economy is entirely dependent on the extent to which the state governs the
religious economy. A monopolized religious economy tends to have lower levels
of participation. Some states may categorically ban religious observances, and
attempt to sanction those who persist in displaying religious conviction.
Disestablishmentarianism results from state withdrawal from an organization
that was originally established under the state. Theorists argue that, much as
a grocery store sells food, religious groups attempt to "sell" beliefs and
ideas. They attempt to influence the religious 'consumer' to choose their
product. Two important ways to influence believers are morals and fear. Morals
are the concepts of right and wrong. Moral communities are groups within the
religious communities in which there is a very high agreement on norms and
strong bonds of attachment among members. Moral behaviors of individuals are
influenced by their religious commitments only in societies where the dominant
organizations give clear and consistent expression to divine moral imperatives.
Religious markets are similar to other markets in that they are social
creations. The exchanges that take place in a religious market are regulated by
social factors. Elements of social interactions such as norms and morals
influence the individual choices and preferences of the religious consumer.
Therefore, elements of social interactions influence the types of religious
goods offered to consumers in the marketplace and the changes in consumer
demands over a span of time. According to W. Robertson Smith, "The fear of the
gods was a motive to enforce the laws of society which were also the laws of
morality". People are taught that those who believe will gain rewards or avoid
punishment in the afterlife, and non-believers will miss out on the rewards or
receive punishment. Major debates. The idea of religious economy frames
religion as a product and as those who practice or identify with any particular
religion as a consumer. But when the idea of belief is brought in to the
equation, this definition expands, and ideology affects the "product" and who
"consumes" it. When examining depictions of religious identity in a global
world, it is easy to see how ideology affects religious economy. Carl L.
Bankston III refers to religions and religious groups as "â€¦competing firms
vie for customers who make rational choices among available productsâ€¦" (311).
Using a liberal economic (see Economic liberalism) framework for analysis,
Bankston is claiming that religions and religious groupsâ€™ popularity is
dependent on the laws of supply and demand. As a marketplace, religious
consumers are subject to things such as marketing, availability of product,
resources, brand recognition, etc. But unlike some actual commodity such as a
computer, these commodities speak to an individualâ€™s beliefs. Bankston poses
the idea that belief deals with ideology and extends beyond what one would
typically define as a market good by stating "â€¦belief is produced and resides
in communicated thoughts, (and) the consumers of goods of faith can only become
consumers by becoming producers, by participating in interactions of beliefâ€¦"
(322). Secularization and religious economy. Prior to the emergence of the
theory of religious economy some scholars of religion, such as Steve Bruce,
believed that modernization would lead inevitably to the erosion of
religiosity. These sociologists have predicted the disappearance of religion
from Earth, based on the decline in religious belief and observance in Western
Europe. According to the theory of religious economy, societies that restrict
supply of religion, either through an imposed state religious monopoly or
through state sponsored secularization, are the main causes of drops in
religiosity. Correspondingly, the more religions a society has, the more likely
the population is to be religious. This is refuted in the orthodox view by
stating that if a liberal religious community is tolerant of a wide array of
belief, then they are less likely to hold certain beliefs in common, so nothing
can be shared and reified in a community context. If nothing is shared, then
nothing is shunned, and there is thus a loss in observance of modern liberal
traditions. Revival. According to Rodney Stark, revival is another aspect of
religious change which coincides with secularization. Over time established
religious groups will spawn smaller and less worldly sub groups of the faith.
This trend of revival provides a plausible explanation why religion never seems
to fade away and to why previously prominent religious organizations have
dissipated. Revival produces a shift in which religious groups a population
will follow and proves effective against the demise of religion. Cults. Unlike
a sect which follows traditions from its parent religion a cult presents
completely new religious traditions. Cult is simply another word for a new
religion and all current religions at one point could have been considered cult
movements. The negative connotations on the word cult have led to hostility
between these movements and their social environments. Rodney Stark defines the
two reactions from secularization being revival and cult formation. As old
faiths eventually weaken the rise of different religious sects and cults will
prevail. Growth of strict religions. A set of famous papers in religious
economy have spurred debate on how and why new religious groups might be
differentially growing depending on the strictness of the doctrine to which
adherents are obligated. Why are strict groups growing in popularity in US and
around the world? Are less strict groups in decline, or are they simply later
in their organizational and demographic life cycles? Strict regulations to
enforce strong ties. Strict Churches are prevalent in the US and around the
world and while people still question and debate their ascent, their ties are
characteristically defined as being strong within the group with few weak ties
branching outside to other groups. Strict churches arise from strict doctrines
and can be in many forms such as large churches, sects, or cults but are not
limited to these. Churches are most often known for their â€œcosmopolitan
networks, while sects tend to consist of intense local networks,â€ while this
may be true for â€œunstrictâ€ doctrines this is not always the case for strict
doctrines. Strong doctrines can arise from certain sects as various religions
have done such as Orthodox Judaism, Islam, certain denominations of
Christianity, or can include rather smaller cults or small sects. What all
strong doctrines employ though, are formal controls to discourage free riding
within the group and to keep the church strong and together. These controls can
vary from church to church but all serve the same purpose of keeping group
solidarity. As commonly seen strict churches employ various means of keeping
their ties in their church strong while limiting excessive access to other
groups such as dress code, eating habits, and rituals that prevent mixing with
other groups. The implication of these, â€œstrict demands â€˜strengthenâ€™ a
church in three ways; they raise overall levels of commitment, they increase
average rates of participation, and they enhance the net benefits of
membership.â€ Complying with these demands prevent the members of a church
from free loading within the group and promote group solidarity. The strict
rules that govern and regulate a church actually help and promote the strength
of the ties within the group. Those who donâ€™t comply with these strictures
are screened out leaving only those who do comply and comply earnestly.â€
These strict doctrines and regulations serve to keep the church strong and
together while screening out members that may actually harm the church
unintentionally by be free loaders within the group. Church-sect theory.
Originally proposed by H. Richard Niebuhr in his book "The Social Sources of
Denominationalism", the theory discusses the difference between churches and
sects. Niebuhr proposed that there is a cycle which sects and churches follow.
Religions originate as sects designed to serve the needs of the deprived. If
they flourish, they increasingly serve the interests of the middle and upper
classes and are transformed into churches. Once the sects have become churches
they become less effective in satisfying the needs of the lower class and the
formation of a sect is re-created. In 1963 Benton Johnson revised the church-
sect theory into its current state. Church and sect form opposite poles on an
axis representing the amount of "tension" between religious organizations and
their social environments. Tension, as defined by Benton Johnson, is "a
manifestation of deviance." The tension is described to be between the groups
members and the outside world. Churches are described as religious bodies
having low tension, whereas, sects have high tension. Religion in the U.S.
compared to other nations. Different nations vary in religious makeup and
fervency. Most people in the world are religious. People don't consider
themselves as religious if they are not fully involved in the church by
contributing money or attending service every Sunday. On the other hand, it is
more rare to claim to be an atheist. A country in which atheism is common is
China. About 24 percent of the Chinese population claim to be â€œconvinced
atheists.â€ Atheism in China is researched to be a result from Communism which
stresses atheism. But, one can not put a title on China as the â€œatheist
country.â€ Moral behaviors of individuals are suggested by religious loyalties
only in societies where the dominant religious congregations give clear rules
to follow moral actions. In US and Europe, the gods are conceived as powerful
and judgmental whereas in Japan and China, they are conceived as many, small,
and not particularly interested in moral behavior. Therefore, in Japan and
China, religion is unrelated to moral actions. The United States is extremely
diverse with high levels of religious participation. The United States
maintains a high degree of religious pluralism. Americans tend to contribute
more money to their churches compared to other countries. There are an
estimated 15,000 denominations in the United Statesâ€”an extremely free
religious economy. Church membership and attendance in the Western United
States is lower than the other states. The United States is much more
religiously diverse than other countries, though comparable to Canada. Church
membership is relatively high in both countries. Canada is estimated about 61
percent and the United States reported 63 percent. Canada does not have as much
religious pluralism as the United States with only a little over 200
denominations existing compared to the 15,000 in the United States. The United
States continues to grow at a faster rate than Canada. Compared to the U.S.,
church attendance in Europe is far lower. For example, in Iceland and Denmark
weekly church turnout is less than 4 percent of the population and only 6
percent in Sweden. Latin America is becoming increasingly more Protestant. 22
percent of the population belongs to Protestant congregations in Chile, 20
percent in Guatemala, and 16 percent in Brazil. With this rapid growth, it is
estimated that Protestantism will be the majority in Latin America within the
next twenty years. Governments has not been moving against non-Catholics
anymore which leaves an open door for religious pluralism to build in Latin
America. Ex-Communist countries. Russia and Eastern European countries have
collectively been moving towards atheism. The cause of this may be the collapse
of the Soviet Union as well as the communist government imposed by the Russian
army at the end of WWII. The communists tried to wipe out all traces of
religions in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. As a result of this effort,
there are only about 5,000 religious congregations of all faiths still in the
Soviet Union. This is roughly the same number as currently exist in the state
of Kentucky. Even though the communist government thought they had succeeded in
destroying religion in their nation, research and data have concluded that
atheists are few and far in between in Russia and Eastern Europe. Research
conducted by Paul Froese at Baylor University, examines the prevalence and
dynamics of religious beliefs and monopolies post-communism in the former
Soviet Union. This study is one area of research of interest to sociologists
researching religious economic theory because it observes governmental
influence on religious beliefs and affiliations. Prior to the 1980s, the Soviet
government imposed religious restrictions on its citizens in hopes that they
would come to hold the beliefs of Atheism. The government's intentions were to
free its people from the psychological bondage of religion, encouraging the
formation of a fully industrialized society. The Soviet Union remained fairly
intact until the 1990s, however, religious restrictions gradually loosened and
the people of the Soviet Union began to abandon Atheism in large numbers.
According to this study, since the 1970s, 100 million people living in the
former Soviet Union have come to affiliate themselves with some religious group
for the first time in their lives. Ex Soviet states have widely divergent
levels of religious affiliation. For example, irreligion in Lithuania is 19.4%,
while for Estonia this is 75.7%.
