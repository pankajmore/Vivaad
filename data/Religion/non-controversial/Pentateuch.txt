Torah The Torah (; , "Instruction", "Teaching") is the Jewish name for the
first five books of the Jewish Bible. In Hebrew the five books are named by the
first phrase in the text: "Bereshit" ("In beginning", Genesis), "Shemot"
("Names", Exodus), "Vayikra" ("He called", Leviticus), "Bamidbar" ("In the
desert", Numbers) and "Devarim" ("Words", Deuteronomy). In rabbinic literature
the word Torah denotes both these five books, "Torah Shebichtav" (×ª×•×¨×”
×©×‘×›×ª×‘, "Torah that is written"), and an Oral Torah, "Torah Shebe'al Peh"
(×ª×•×¨×” ×©×‘×¢×œ ×¤×”, "Torah that is spoken"). The Oral Torah consists of
the traditional interpretations and amplifications handed down by word of mouth
from generation to generation and now embodied in the Talmud
(×ªÖ·Ö¼×œÖ°××•Ö¼×“) and Midrash (××“×¨×©). The words of the Torah are written
on a scroll by a "sofer" on parchment in Hebrew. A Torah portion must be read
publicly at least once every three days, in the halachically prescribed tune,
in the presence of a congregation, which is the basis for Jewish communal life.
According to religious tradition, all of the laws found in the Torah, both
written and oral, were given by God to Moses, some of them at Mount Sinai and
others at the Tabernacle, and all the teachings were written down by Moses,
which resulted in the Torah we have today. According to a Midrash, the Torah
was created prior to the creation of the world, and was used as the blueprint
for Creation. Most modern biblical scholars believe that the written books were
a product of the Babylonian exilic period (c. 600Â BCE) and that it was
completed by the Persian period (c. 400Â BCE). Meaning and names. The word
"Torah" in Hebrew is derived from the root ×™×¨×”, which in the "hifil"
conjugation means "to guide/teach" (cf. Lev. 10:11). The meaning of the word is
therefore "teaching", "doctrine", or "instruction"; the commonly accepted "law"
gives a wrong impression. Other translational contexts in the English language
include custom, theory, guidance, or system. The term "Torah" is used in the
general sense to include both rabbinic Judaism's written law and oral law,
serving to encompass the entire spectrum of authoritative Jewish religious
teachings throughout history, including the Mishnah, the Talmud, the Midrash
and more, and the inaccurate rendering of "Torah" as "Law" may be an obstacle
to understanding the ideal that is summed up in the term "talmud torah"
(×ª×œ××•×“ ×ª×•×¨×”, "study of Torah"). The earliest name for the first part
of the Bible seems to have been "The Torah of Moses". This title, however, is
found neither in the Torah itself, nor in the works of the pre-Exilic literary
prophets. It appears in Joshua (8:31â€“32; 23:6) and Kings (I Kings 2:3; II
Kings 14:6; 23:25), but it cannot be said to refer there to the entire corpus.
In contrast, there is every likelihood that its use in the post-Exilic works
(Mal. 3:22; Dan. 9:11, 13; Ezra 3:2; 7:6; Neh. 8:1; II Chron. 23:18; 30:16) was
intended to be comprehensive. Other early titles were "The Book of Moses" (Ezra
6:18; Neh. 13:1; II Chron. 35:12; 25:4; cf. II Kings 14:6) and "The Book of the
Torah" (Neh. 8:3), which seems to be a contraction of a fuller name, "The Book
of the Torah of God" (Neh. 8:8, 18; 10:29â€“30; cf. 9:3). Scholars usually
refer to the first five books of the Hebrew Bible as the "Pentateuch", a term
first used in the Hellenistic Judaism of Alexandria, meaning five books, or as
the Law, or Law of Moses. Muslims refer to the Torah as "Tawrat" (, "Law"), an
Arabic word for the revelations given to the Islamic prophet "Musa" (, Moses in
Arabic). Composition. According to Jewish tradition (later adopted by
Christianity) the Torah was dictated to Moses by God, with the exception of the
last eight verses of Deuteronomy, which describe the death and burial of Moses.
This belief is based on the Mishnah (100 BCE â€“ 100 CE), the Mishnah being the
first time that traditions that were transmitted orally from the time of Moses
were put in writing. It is also based on the Hebrew Torah that states in
Deuteronomy 31:24â€“26; after Moses finished writing the words of this Torah in
a book from beginning to end. He gave this command to the Levites who carried
the ark of the covenant of the Lord: "Take this Book of the Torah and place it
beside the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God. There it will remain as a
witness upon you". The Torah refers to this book of the Torah that was
entrusted to the Levites in regard to rules pertaining to a king. Deuteronomy
17:18 states; When he takes the throne of his kingdom, he is to write for
himself on a scroll a copy of this Torah, taken from that of the Levitical
priests. Today the majority of academic scholars accept that the Torah does not
have a single author, and that its composition took place over centuries. From
the late 19th century there was a general consensus around the documentary
hypothesis, which suggests that the five books were created c. 450Â BCE by
combining four originally independent sources, known as the Jahwist, or J (c.
900Â BCE), the Elohist, or E (c. 800Â BCE), the Deuteronomist, or D, (c.
600Â BCE), and the Priestly source, or P (c. 500Â BCE). This general agreement
began to break down in the late 1970s, and today there are many theories but no
consensus, or even majority viewpoint. Variations of the documentary hypothesis
remain popular especially in America and Israel, and the identification of
distinctive Deuteronomistic and Priestly theologies and vocabularies remains
widespread, but they are used to form new approaches suggesting that the books
were combined gradually over time by the slow accumulation of "fragments" of
text, or that a basic text was "supplemented" by later authors/editors. At the
same time there has been a tendency to bring the origins of the Pentateuch
further forward in time, and the most recent proposals place it in 5th century
Judah under the Persian empire. Deuteronomy is often treated separately from
Genesis, Exodus, Numbers, Leviticus. The process of its formation probably took
several hundred years, from the 8th century to the 6th, and its authors have
been variously identified as prophetic circles (because the concerns of
Deuteronomy mirror those of the prophets, especially Hosea), Levitical priestly
circles (because it stresses the role of the Levites), and wisdom and scribal
circles (because it esteems wisdom, and because the treaty-form in which it is
written would be best known to scribes). According to the theory of the
Deuteronomistic history proposed by Martin Noth and widely accepted,
Deuteronomy was a product of the court of Josiah (late 7th century) before
being used as the introduction to a comprehensive history of Israel written in
the early part of the 6th century; later still it was detached from the history
and used to round off the Pentateuch. Many Jews, including a majority of
Israeli Jews, believe that the Torah was revealed to Moses by God, implicitly
rejecting a theory that holds that the Torah was complied by an unknown editor
from multiple sources. Reasons for this belief can be that it is supported by
what they view as the historical narrative, that the Hebrew Torah in
Deuteronomy 31:24â€“26, as well as the Talmud (Gittin 60a, Bava Basra 14b),
state that Moses wrote the Torah, and that the Mishnah asserts the divine
origin of the Torah as one of the essential tenets of Judaism. Many Jews also
accept the 13 Principles of Faith that were established by Maimonides, one of
which that states; The Torah that we have today is the one dictated to Moses by
God. Structure. According to the Oral tradition, the prose in the Torah is not
always in chronological order. Sometimes it is ordered by concept according to
the rule: "There is not 'earlier' and 'later' in the Torah" (××™×Ÿ ××•×§×“×
×•×××•×—×¨ ×‘×ª×•×¨×”, "Ein mukdam u'meuchar baTorah"). This position is
accepted by Orthodox Judaism. Non-Orthodox Jews generally understand the same
texts as signs that the current text of the Torah was redacted from earlier
sources. Contents. Bereshit (Genesis) begins with the so-called "primeval
history" (Genesis 1â€“11), the story of the world's beginnings and the descent
of Abraham. This is followed by the story of the three patriarchs (Abraham,
Isaac and Jacob), Joseph (Genesis 12â€“50) and the four matriarchs (Sarah,
Rebekah, Leah and Rachel). God gives to the patriarchs a promise of the land of
Canaan, but at the end of Genesis the sons of Jacob end up leaving Canaan for
Egypt due to a regional famine. They had heard that there was a grain storage
and distribution facility in Egypt. Shemot (Exodus) begins the story of God's
revelation to his people Israel through Moses, who leads them out of Egypt
(Exodus 1â€“18) to Mount Sinai. There the people accept a covenant with God,
agreeing to be his people in return for agreeing to abide by his Law. Moses
receives the Torah from God, and mediates His laws and Covenant (Exodus
19â€“24) to the people of Israel. Exodus also deals with the first violation of
the covenant when the Golden Calf was constructed (Exodus 32â€“34). Exodus
concludes with the instructions on building the Tabernacle (Exodus 25â€“31;
35â€“40). Vayikra (Leviticus) begins with instructions to the Israelites on how
to use the Tabernacle, which they had just built (Leviticus 1â€“10). This is
followed by rules of clean and unclean (Leviticus 11â€“15), which includes the
laws of slaughter and animals permissible to eat (see also: Kashrut), the Day
of Atonement (Leviticus 16), and various moral and ritual laws sometimes called
the Holiness Code (Leviticus 17â€“26). Bamidbar (Numbers) tells how Israel
consolidated itself as a community at Sinai (Numbers 1â€“9), set out from Sinai
to move towards Canaan and spied out the land (Numbers 10â€“13). Because of
unbelief at various points, but especially at Kadesh Barnea (Numbers 14), the
Israelites were condemned to wander for forty years in the desert in the
vicinity of Kadesh instead of immediately entering the Promised Land. Even
Moses sins and is told he would not live to enter the land (Numbers 20). At the
end of Numbers (Numbers 26â€“35) Israel moves from Kadesh to the plains of Moab
opposite Jericho, ready to enter the Promised Land. Devarim (Deuteronomy) is a
series of speeches by Moses on the plains of Moab opposite Jericho. Moses
proclaims the Law (Deuteronomy 12â€“26), gives instruction concerning covenant
renewal at Shechem (Deuteronomy 27â€“28) and gives Israel new laws (the
"Deuteronomic Code)". At the end of the book (Deuteronomy 34) Moses is allowed
to see the promised land from a mountain, but it is not known what happened to
Moses on the mountain. He was never seen again. Knowing that he is nearing the
end of his life, Moses appoints Joshua his successor, bequeathing to him the
mantle of leadership. Soon afterwards Israel begins the conquest of Canaan.
Torah and Judaism. Rabbinic writings offer various ideas on when the Torah was
composed. The revelation to Moses at Mount Sinai is considered by most to be
the revelatory event. According to dating of the text by Orthodox rabbis, this
occurred in 1312Â BCE; another date given for this event is 1280Â BCE. The
Talmud (Gittin 60a), brings two opinions as to when the Torah was written by
Moses. One opinion holds that it was written by Moses gradually over many years
as it was dictated to him, and finished close to his death, and the other
opinion holds that Moses wrote the complete Torah in one writing close to his
death, based on what was dictated to him over the years. The Talmud (Minachot
30a) says that the last eight verses of the Torah that discuss the death and
burial of Moses could not have been written by Moses, as writing it would have
been a lie, and that they were written after his death by Joshua. Abraham ibn
Ezra and Joseph Bonfils observed that phrases in those verses present
information that people should only have known after the time of Moses. Ibn
Ezra hinted, and Bonfils explicitly stated, that Joshua wrote these verses many
years after the death of Moses. Other commentators do not accept this position
and maintain that although Moses did not write those eight verses it was
nonetheless dictated to him and that Joshua wrote it based on instructions left
by Moses, and that the Torah often describes future events, some of which have
yet to occur. The Talmud (tractate Sabb. 115b) states that a peculiar section
in the Book of Numbers (10:35â€“36, surrounded by inverted Hebrew letter nuns)
in fact forms a separate book. On this verse a midrash on the book of "Mishle"
(English Proverbs) states that "These two verses stem from an independent book
which existed, but was suppressed!" Another (possibly earlier) midrash, Ta'ame
Haserot Viyterot, states that this section actually comes from the book of
prophecy of Eldad and Medad. The Talmud says that God dictated four books of
the Torah, but that Moses wrote Deuteronomy in his own words (Talmud Bavli,
Meg. 31b). All classical rabbinic views hold that the Torah was entirely or
almost entirely Mosaic and of divine origin. Ritual use. Torah reading () is a
Jewish religious ritual that involves the public reading of a set of passages
from a Torah scroll. The term often refers to the entire ceremony of removing
the Torah scroll (or scrolls) from the ark, chanting the appropriate excerpt
with special cantillation, and returning the scroll(s) to the ark. It is
distinct from academic Torah study. As a part of the morning or afternoon
prayer services on certain days of the week or holidays, a section of the
Pentateuch is read from a Torah scroll. On Shabbat (Saturday) mornings, a
weekly section (""parasha"") is read, selected so that the entire Pentateuch is
read consecutively each year. On Saturday afternoons, Mondays, and Thursdays,
the beginning of the following Saturday's portion is read. On Jewish holidays,
the beginnings of each month, and fast days, special sections connected to the
day are read. Jews observe an annual holiday, Simchat Torah, to celebrate the
completion and new start of the year's cycle of readings. Torah scrolls are
often dressed with a sash, a special Torah cover, various ornaments and a Keter
(crown), although such customs vary among synagogues. Congregants traditionally
stand when the Torah is brought out of the ark to be read, while it is being
carried, and lifted, and likewise while it is returned to the ark, although
they sit during the reading itself. Biblical law. The Torah contains
narratives, statements of law, and statements of ethics. Collectively these
laws, usually called biblical law or commandments, are sometimes referred to as
the Law of Moses ("Torat Moshe" ), Mosaic Law, or Sinaitic Law. The Torah and
Judaism's oral law. According to classical rabbinic texts this parallel set of
material was originally transmitted to Moses at Sinai, and then from Moses to
Israel. At that time it was forbidden to write and publish the oral law, as any
writing would be incomplete and subject to misinterpretation and abuse.
However, after exile, dispersion and persecution, this tradition was lifted
when it became apparent that in writing was the only way to ensure that the
Oral Law could be preserved. After many years of effort by a great number of
tannaim, the oral tradition was written down around 200Â CE by Rabbi Judah
haNasi, who took up the compilation of a nominally written version of the Oral
Law, the Mishnah (Hebrew: ××©× ×”). Other oral traditions from the same time
period not entered into the Mishnah were recorded as "Baraitot" (external
teaching), and the Tosefta. Other traditions were written down as Midrashim.
After continued persecution more of the oral law was committed to writing. A
great many more lessons, lectures and traditions only alluded to in the few
hundred pages of Mishnah, became the thousands of pages now called the
"Gemara". Gemara is written in Aramaic, having been compiled in Babylon. The
Mishnah and Gemara together are called the Talmud. The Rabbis in Israel also
collected their traditions and compiled them into the Jerusalem Talmud. Since
the greater number of Rabbis lived in Babylon, the Babylonian Talmud has
precedence should the two be in conflict. Orthodox and Conservative branches of
Judaism accept these texts as the basis for all subsequent halakha and codes of
Jewish law, which are held to be normative. Reform and Reconstructionist
Judaism deny that these texts may be used for determining normative law (laws
accepted as binding) but accept them as the authentic and only Jewish version
for understanding the Torah and its development throughout history. Humanistic
Judaism holds that the Torah is a historical, political, and sociological text,
but does not believe that every word of the Torah is true, or even morally
correct. Humanistic Judaism is willing to question the Torah and to disagree
with it, believing that the entire Jewish experience, not just the Torah,
should be the source for Jewish behavior and ethics. Divine significance of
letters, Jewish mysticism. Kabbalists hold that not only are the words giving a
divine message, but indicate a far greater message that extends beyond them.
Thus they hold that even as small a mark as a "kotzo shel yod" (×§×•×¦×• ×©×œ
×™×•×“), the serif of the Hebrew letter "yod" (×™), the smallest letter, or
decorative markings, or repeated words, were put there by God to teach scores
of lessons. This is regardless of whether that yod appears in the phrase "I am
the Lord thy God" (, Exodus 20:2) or whether it appears in "And God spoke unto
Moses saying" ( Exodus 6:2). In a similar vein, Rabbi Akiva (c. 50 â€“ c. 135
CE), is said to have learned a new law from every "et" (××ª) in the Torah
(Talmud, tractate Pesachim 22b); the word "et" is meaningless by itself, and
serves only to mark the direct object. In other words, the Orthodox belief is
that even apparently contextual text "And God spoke unto Moses sayingÂ ..." is
no less important than the actual statement. One kabbalistic interpretation is
that the Torah constitutes one long name of God, and that it was broken up into
words so that human minds can understand it. While this is effective since it
accords with our human reason, it is not the only way that the text can be
broken up. Production and use of a Torah scroll. Manuscript Torah scrolls are
still used, and still scribed, for ritual purposes (i.e., religious services);
this is called a "Sefer Torah" ("Book Torah"). They are written using a
painstakingly careful methodology by highly qualified scribes. This has
resulted in modern copies of the text that are unchanged from millennia-old
copies. It is believed that every word, or marking, has divine meaning, and
that not one part may be inadvertently changed lest it lead to error. The
fidelity of the Hebrew text of the Tanakh, and the Torah in particular, is
considered paramount, down to the last letter: translations or transcriptions
are frowned upon for formal service use, and transcribing is done with
painstaking care. An error of a single letter, ornamentation, or symbol of the
304,805 stylized letters that make up the Hebrew Torah text renders a Torah
scroll unfit for use, hence a special skill is required and a scroll takes
considerable time to write and check. According to Jewish law, a "sefer Torah"
(plural: "Sifrei Torah") is a copy of the formal Hebrew text of hand-written on
"gevil" or "qlaf" (forms of parchment) by using a quill (or other permitted
writing utensil) dipped in ink. Written entirely in Hebrew, a "sefer Torah"
contains 304,805 letters, all of which must be duplicated precisely by a
trained "sofer" ("scribe"), an effort that may take as long as approximately
one and a half years. Most modern Sifrei Torah are written with forty-two lines
of text per column (Yemenite Jews use fifty), and very strict rules about the
position and appearance of the Hebrew letters are observed. See for example the
Mishna Berura on the subject. Any of several Hebrew scripts may be used, most
of which are fairly ornate and exacting. The completion of the sefer Torah is a
cause for great celebration, and it is a Mitzvah for every Jew to either write
or have written for him a Sefer Torah. Torah scrolls are stored in the holiest
part of the synagogue in the Ark known as the "Holy Ark" ( "aron hakodesh" in
Hebrew.) "Aron" in Hebrew means "cupboard" or "closet", and kodesh is derived
from "kadosh", or "holy". In other religions. While Christianity includes the
five books of Moses (the "Pentateuch") among their sacred texts in its Old
Testament, Islam believes that only the original Torah was sent by the One true
God. In both religions they lack the religious legal significance that they
have in Orthodox Judaism. Among early centers of Christianity a Koine Greek
version of the Hebrew Bible was used by Greek speakers (Aramaic Targums were
used by Aramaic speakers such as the Syriac Orthodox Church). The Greek
version's name in Latin is the Septuagint: L. "septem" meaning seven, plus "-
gintÄ" meaning "times ten". It was named "Septuagint" from the traditional
number of its translators. This Greek version of the Hebrew Scriptures dates
from the 3rd century B.C., originally associated with Hellenistic Judaism. It
contains both a translation of the Hebrew and additional and variant material.
It was regarded as the standard form of the Old Testament in the early Greek
Christian Church and is still considered canonical in the Eastern Orthodox
Church. Though different Christian denominations have slightly different
versions of the Old Testament in their Bibles, the Torah as the "Five Books of
Moses" (or "the Mosaic Law") is common among them all. The Quran refers heavily
to Moses to outline the truth of his existence and the religious guidelines
that God had revealed to the Children of Israel. God says in the Qur'an, "It is
He Who has sent down the Book (the Qur'an) to you with truth, confirming what
came before it. And He sent down the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)."
[3:1] Muslims call the Torah the "Tawrat" and consider it the word of God given
to Moses. However, Muslims also believe that this original revelation was
corrupted ("tahrif") over time by Jewish scribes and hence do not revere the
present "Jewish version" Torah as much. The Torah in the Qur'an is always
mentioned with respect in Islam. The Muslims' belief in the Torah, as well as
the prophethood of Moses, is one of the fundamental tenets of Islam.
