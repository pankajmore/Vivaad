Prayer for the dead Wherever there is a belief in the continued existence of
man's personality through and after death, religion naturally concerns itself
with the relations between the living and the dead. And where the idea of a
future judgment or a Resurrection of the Dead or of Purgatory obtains, prayers
are often offered on behalf of the dead to God. Judaism. Prayers for the dead
form part of the Jewish services. The prayers offered on behalf of the deceased
consist of: Recitation of Psalms; Reciting a thrice daily communal prayer in
Aramaic which is known as ""Kaddish"". Kaddish actually means "Sanctification"
(or "Prayer of Making Holy") which is a prayer "In Praise of God"; or other
special remembrances known as Yizkor; and also a Hazkara which is said either
on the annual commemoration known as the Yahrzeit as well on Jewish holidays.
The form in use in England contains the following passage: "Have mercy upon
him; pardon all his transgressions . . . Shelter his soul in the shadow of Thy
wings. Make known to him the path of life." Christianity. New Testament. As
with the verses from 2 Maccabees, these verses refer to prayers that will help
the deceased "on that day" (perhaps Judgement Day, see also end times). It is
not stated that Onesiphorus, for whom Saint Paul prayed, was dead, though some
scholars infer this, based on the way Paul only refers to him in the past
tense, and prays for present blessings on his household, but for him only "on
that day". And towards the end of the same letter, in , Paul sends greetings to
"Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus", distinguishing the situation
of Onesiphorus from that of the still living Prisca and Aquila. Tradition.
Prayer for the dead is well documented within early Christianity, both among
prominent Church Fathers and the Christian community in general. In Eastern
Orthodoxy Christians pray for "such souls as have departed with faith, but
without having had time to bring forth fruits worthy of repentance". In the
Catholic Church the assistance that the dead receive by prayer on their behalf
is linked with the process of purification known as purgatory. While prayer for
the dead continues in both these traditions and in those of Oriental Orthodoxy
and of the Assyrian Church of the East, many Protestant groups reject the
practice. The tomb of the Christian Abercius of Hieropolis in Phrygia (latter
part of the 2nd century) bears the inscription: "Let every friend who observes
this pray for me", i.e. Abercius, who throughout speaks in the first person.
Among Church writers Tertullian (‚Ä  230) is the first to mention prayers for
the dead, and not as a concession to natural sentiment, but as a duty: "The
widow who does not pray for her dead husband has as good as divorced him". This
passage occurs in one of his later Montanist writings, dating from the
beginning of the 3rd century. Subsequent writers similarly make incidental
mention of the practice as prevalent, but not as unlawful or even disputed
(until Arius challenged it towards the end of the 4th century). The most famous
instance is Saint Augustine's prayer for his mother, Monica, at the end of the
9th book of his "Confessions", written around 398. An important element in the
Christian liturgies both East and West consisted of the diptychs, or lists of
names of living and dead commemorated at the Eucharist. To be inserted in these
lists was a confirmation of one's orthodoxy, and out of the practice grew the
official canonization of saints; on the other hand, removal of a name was a
condemnation. In the middle of the 3rd century we find St. Cyprian enjoining
that there should be no oblation or public prayer made for a deceased layman
who had broken the Church's rule by appointing a cleric trustee under his will:
"He ought not to be named in the priests prayer who has done his best to detain
the clergy from the altar." "Remember, O Lord, the God of Spirits and of all
Flesh, those whom we have remembered and those whom we have not remembered, men
of the true faith, from righteous Abel unto to-day; do thou thyself give them
rest there in the land of the living, in thy kingdom, in the delight of
Paradise, in the bosom of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, our holy fathers, from
whence pain and sorrow and sighing have fled away, where the light of thy
countenance visiteth them and always shineth upon them." Public prayers were
only offered for those who were believed to have died as faithful members of
the Church. But Saint Perpetua, who was martyred in 202, believed herself to
have been encouraged in a vision to pray for her brother, who had died in his
eighth year, almost certainly unbaptized; and a later vision assured her that
her prayer was answered and he had been translated from punishment. St.
Augustine thought it needful to point out that the narrative was not canonical
Scripture, and contended that the child had perhaps been baptized. Eastern
Christianity. Theology. Among the Eastern and Oriental Orthodox, while there is
no doctrine of purgatory, prayer for the dead is encouraged in the belief that
it is helpful for them. Specifically "how" the prayers of the faithful help the
departed is not elucidated; Eastern Orthodox simply believe that tradition
teaches "that" prayers should be made for the dead. Saint Basil the Great (‚Ä 
379), a saint of undivided Christianity, writes in his Third Kneeling Prayer at
Pentecost "O Christ our God...(who) on this all-perfect and saving Feast, art
graciously pleased to accept propitiatory prayers for those who are imprisoned
in hades, promising unto us who are held in bondage great hope of release from
the vilenes that doth hinder us and did hinder them ... send down Thy
consolation... and establish their souls in the mansions of the Just; and
graciously vouchsafe unto them peace and pardon; for not the dead shall praise
thee, O Lord, neither shall they who are in Hell make bold to offer unto thee
confession. But we who are living will bless thee, and will pray, and offer
unto thee propitiatory prayers and sacrifices for their souls." Saint Gregory
Dialogus (‚Ä  604) in his famous "Dialogues" (written in 593) teaches that,
"The Holy Sacrifice (Eucharist) of Christ, our saving Victim, brings great
benefits to souls even after death, provided their sins (are such as) can be
pardoned in the life to come." However, St. Gregory goes on to say, the
Church's practice of prayer for the dead must not be an excuse for not living a
godly life on earth. "The safer course, naturally, is to do for ourselves
during life what we hope others will do for us after death." Father Seraphim
Rose (‚Ä  1982) says, "the Church's prayer cannot save anyone who does not wish
salvation, or who never offered any struggle (podvig) for it himself during his
lifetime." Eastern Orthodox Praxis. The various prayers for the departed have
as their purpose to pray for the repose of the departed, to comfort the living,
and to remind those who remain of their own mortality. For this reason,
memorial services have an air of penitence about them. The Church's prayers for
the dead begin at the moment of death, when the priest leads the "Prayers at
the Departure of the Soul ", consisting of a special Canon and prayers for the
release of the soul. Then the body is washed, clothed and laid in the coffin,
after which the priest begins the "First Panikhida" (prayer service for the
departed). After the First Panikhida, the family and friends begin reading the
Psalter aloud beside the casket. This reading continues until the funeral
begins (usually on the third day after death), being interrupted only by more
Panikhidas (at least one per day). The most important form of prayer for the
dead occurs in the Divine Liturgy. Particles are cut from the prosphoron during
the Proskomedie at the beginning of the Liturgy. These particles are placed
beneath the Lamb (Host) on the diskos, where they remain throughout the
Liturgy. After the Communion of the faithful, the deacon brushes these
particles into the chalice, saying, "Wash away, O Lord, the sins of all those
here commemorated, by Thy Precious Blood, through the prayers of all thy
saints." Of this action, Saint Mark of Ephesus says, "We can do nothing better
or greater for the dead than to pray for them, offering commemoration for them
at the Liturgy. Of this they are always in need... The body feels nothing then:
it does not see its close ones who have assembled, does not smell the fragrance
of the flowers, does not hear the funeral orations. But the soul senses the
prayers offered for it and is grateful to those who make them and is
spiritually close to them." Normally, candidates for sainthood, prior to their
Glorification (Canonization) as a saint, will be commemorated by serving
Panikhidas. Then, on the eve of their Glorification will be served an
especially solemn Requiem, known as the "Last Panikhida." Roman Catholic
Church. In the West there is ample evidence of the custom of praying for the
dead in the inscriptions of the catacombs, with their constant prayers for the
peace and refreshment of the souls of the departed and in the early liturgies,
which commonly contain commemorations of the dead; and Tertullian, Cyprian and
other early Western Fathers witness to the regular practice of praying for the
dead. The West felt that it was inappropriate to pray "for" the martyrs, since
they were believed to be in no need of such prayers. Theoretically, too, prayer
for those in hell (understood as the abode of the eternally lost) would be
useless, but since there is no certainty that any particular person is in hell
understood in that sense, prayers were and are offered for all the dead, except
for those believed to be in heaven. These are prayed to, not for. Thus, prayers
were and are offered for all those in Hades, a word that refers to the abode of
the dead who are not known to be in heaven, but that is sometimes rendered as
"hell". With the development of the doctrine of purgatory, the dead prayed for
were spoken of as being in purgatory and, in view of the certainty that by the
process of purification and with the help of the prayers of the faithful they
were destined for heaven, they were referred to as the "holy souls". Limits
were placed on public offering of Mass for the unbaptised and notorious
sinners, but prayers and even Mass in private could be said for them. The
present Code of Canon Law states that, unless the person concerned gave some
signs of repentance before death, no form of funeral Mass may be offered for
notorious apostates, heretics and schismatics; those who for anti-Christian
motives chose that their bodies be cremated; and other manifest sinners to whom
a Church funeral could not be granted without public scandal to the faithful.
On the other hand, "provided their own minister is not available, baptised
persons belonging to a non-catholic Church or ecclesial community may, in
accordance with the prudent judgement of the local Ordinary, be allowed Church
funeral rites, unless it is established that they did not wish this." During
the slaughter of the First World War, Pope Benedict XV on 10 August 1915,
allowed all priests everywhere to say three Masses on All Souls' Day. The two
extra Masses were in no way to benefit the priest himself: one was to be
offered for all the faithful departed, the other for the Pope's intentions,
which at that time were presumed to be for all the victims of that war. The
permission remains. Each Eucharistic Prayer of the Order of Mass has a prayer
for the departed. Anglicanism. The Church of England's 1549 Book of the Common
Prayer still had prayer for the dead, as (in the Communion Service): "We
commend into thy mercy all other thy servants, which are departed hence from us
with the sign of faith and now do rest in the sleep of peace: grant unto them,
we beseech thee, thy mercy and everlasting peace." But since 1552 the Book of
Common Prayer has no express prayers for the dead, and the practice is
denounced in the Homily "On Prayer" (part 3). Nonjurors included prayers for
the dead, a practice that spread within the Church of England in the mid-
nineteenth century, and was authorized in 1900 for forces serving in South
Africa and since then in other forms of service. Many jurisdictions and
parishes of the Anglo-Catholic tradition continue to practice prayer for the
dead, including offering the Sunday liturgy for the peace of named departed
Christians and the keeping of All Soul's Day. Protestant churches. The
sixteenth-century Protestant Reformation continued at first the traditional
custom of praying for the dead, but before long came to denounce it, partly
because they believed it to be without biblical foundation, partly through
their rejection of the doctrine of purgatory and the practices associated with
it. Prayer for the dead is still avoided by those of marked Evangelical belief.
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). The LDS church
has a number of sacred ordinances and rituals that are performed for the dead.
The chief amongst these are baptism for the dead and the sealing of the dead to
families. These practices are based upon multiple New Testament scriptures,
some of which are 1-Corinthians 15:29-32, Matthew 16:19 Islam. In Islam,
Muslims of their community gather to their collective prayers for the
forgiveness of the dead, a prayer is recited and this prayer is known as the
Salat al-Janazah (Janazah prayer). like Eid prayer, the Janazah prayer
incorporates an additional (four) Takbirs, the Arabic name for the phrase
Allahu Akbar, but there is no Ruku' (bowing) and Sujud (prostrating).
Supplication for the deceased and mankind is recited. In extraordinary
circumstances, the prayer can be postponed and prayed at a later time as was
done in the Battle of Uhud. Dogma states it is obligatory for every Muslim
adult male to perform the funeral prayer upon the death of any Muslim, but the
dogma embraces the practical in that it qualifies, when Janazah is performed by
the few it alleviates that obligation for all. In addition, "Peace be upon him"
(sometimes abbreviated in writing as PBUH) is a constantly repeated prayer for
dead people such as Mohammed. Hinduism. In Hinduism there are funeral speeches
with prayers for the dead. Many of these Funeral speeches are read out from the
Mahabharata, usually in Sanskrit. Family members will pray around the body as
soon as possible after Death. People try to avoid touching the corpse as it is
considered polluting. Here is an example of a funeral speech that may be read
out during a Hindu Funeral. Many of these speeches are a collection of
scriptural texts about Life and Death. Buddhism. Along reading Buddhist sutras
such as Sutra of The Great Vows of Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva, Amitabha Sutra or
Diamond Sutra, Ritsu offer refuge, Pure Land Buddhists nianfo and Tibetan
Buddhists chant Om mani padme hum repeatedly. Taoism. Taoists chant Qinghuahao
(ÈùíËèØË™•) or Jiukujing (ÊïëËã¶Á∂ì). Other religions. Zoroastrians chant
prayers in funeral ceremonies. In Bah√°'√≠ Faith a prayer is required only when
the deceased is over the age of fifteen. There are prayers in other religions.
