2011 TÅhoku earthquake and tsunami The , often referred to in Japan as and
also known as the 2011 Tohoku earthquake, the Great East Japan Earthquake, and
the 3.11 Earthquake, was a magnitude 9.03 (Mw) undersea megathrust earthquake
off the coast of Japan that occurred at 14:46 JST (05:46 UTC) on Friday, 11
March 2011, with the epicenter approximately east of the Oshika Peninsula of
TÅhoku and the hypocenter at an underwater depth of approximately . It was the
most powerful known earthquake ever to have hit Japan, and one of the five most
powerful earthquakes in the world since modern record-keeping began in 1900.
The earthquake triggered powerful tsunami waves that reached heights of up to
in Miyako in TÅhoku's Iwate Prefecture, and which, in the Sendai area,
travelled up to inland. The earthquake moved Honshu (the main island of Japan)
east and shifted the Earth on its axis by estimates of between and . On 12
September 2012, a Japanese National Police Agency report confirmed and across
twenty prefectures, as well as 129,225 buildings totally collapsed, with a
further 254,204 buildings 'half collapsed', and another 691,766 buildings
partially damaged. The earthquake and tsunami also caused extensive and severe
structural damage in north-eastern Japan, including heavy damage to roads and
railways as well as fires in many areas, and a dam collapse. Japanese Prime
Minister Naoto Kan said, "In the 65 years after the end of World War II, this
is the toughest and the most difficult crisis for Japan." Around 4.4Â million
households in northeastern Japan were left without electricity and 1.5Â million
without water. The tsunami caused a number of nuclear accidents, primarily the
level 7 meltdowns at three reactors in the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power
Plant complex, and the associated evacuation zones affecting hundreds of
thousands of residents. Many electrical generators were taken down, and at
least three nuclear reactors suffered explosions due to hydrogen gas that had
built up within their outer containment buildings after cooling system failure.
Residents within a radius of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant and a
radius of the Fukushima Daini Nuclear Power Plant were evacuated. In addition,
the U.S. recommended that its citizens evacuate up to of the plant. Early
estimates placed insured losses from the earthquake alone at US$14.5 to
$34.6Â billion. The Bank of Japan offered Â¥15Â trillion (US$183Â billion) to
the banking system on 14 March in an effort to normalize market conditions. The
World Bank's estimated economic cost was US$235Â billion, making it the most
expensive natural disaster in world history. Earthquake. The 9.0 magnitude (MW)
undersea megathrust earthquake occurred on 11 March 2011 at 14:46 JST (05:46
UTC) in the north-western Pacific Ocean at a relatively shallow depth of 32Â km
(19.9Â mi), with its epicenter approximately 72Â km (45Â mi) east of the Oshika
Peninsula of TÅhoku, Japan, lasting approximately six minutes. The earthquake
was initially reported as 7.9Â MW by the USGS before it was quickly upgraded to
8.8 Â MW, then to 8.9 Â MW, and then finally to 9.0 Â MW. Sendai was the
nearest major city to the earthquake, 130Â km (81Â mi) from the epicenter; the
earthquake occurred 373Â km (232Â mi) from Tokyo. The main earthquake was
preceded by a number of large foreshocks, with hundreds of aftershocks
reported. The first major foreshock was a 7.2Â MW event on 9 March,
approximately 40Â km (25Â mi) from the epicenter of the 11 March earthquake,
with another three on the same day in excess of 6.0Â MW. Following the main
earthquake on 11 March, a 7.0Â MW aftershock was reported at 15:06 JST (6:06
UTC), succeeded by a 7.4 Â MW at 15:15 JST (6:16 UTC) and a 7.2 Â MW at 15:26
JST (6:26 UTC). Over eight hundred aftershocks of magnitude 4.5 Â MW or greater
have occurred since the initial quake. Aftershocks follow Omori's Law, which
states that the rate of aftershocks declines with the reciprocal of the time
since the main quake. The aftershocks will thus taper off in time, but could
continue for years. One minute before the earthquake was felt in Tokyo, the
Earthquake Early Warning system, which includes more than 1,000 seismometers in
Japan, sent out warnings of impending strong shaking to millions. It is
believed that the early warning by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) saved
many lives. The warning for the general public was delivered about 8 seconds
after the first P wave was detected, or about 31 seconds after the earthquake
occurred. However, the estimated intensities were smaller than the actual ones
in some places in Kanto and Tohoku regions. This was thought to be because of
smaller estimated earthquake magnitude, smaller estimated fault plane, shorter
estimated fault length, not having considered the shape of the fault, etc.
There were also cases where large differences between estimated intensities by
the Earthquake Early Warning system and the actual intensities occurred in the
aftershocks and triggered earthquakes. Geology. This earthquake occurred where
the Pacific Plate is subducting under the plate beneath northern Honshu; which
plate is a matter of debate amongst scientists. The Pacific plate, which moves
at a rate of 8 to 9Â cm (3.1 to 3.5 in) per year, dips under Honshu's
underlying plate releasing large amounts of energy. This motion pulls the upper
plate down until the stress builds up enough to cause a seismic event. The
break caused the sea floor to rise by several meters. A quake of this magnitude
usually has a rupture length of at least 480Â km (300Â mi) and generally
requires a long, relatively straight fault surface. Because the plate boundary
and subduction zone in the area of the rupture is not very straight, it is
unusual for the magnitude of an earthquake to exceed 8.5; the magnitude of this
earthquake was a surprise to some seismologists. The hypocentral region of this
earthquake extended from offshore Iwate Prefecture to offshore Ibaraki
Prefecture. The Japanese Meteorological Agency said that the earthquake may
have ruptured the fault zone from Iwate to Ibaraki with a length of 500Â km
(310Â mi) and a width of 200Â km (120Â mi). Analysis showed that this
earthquake consisted of a set of three events. The earthquake may have had a
mechanism similar to that of another large earthquake in 869 with an estimated
surface wave magnitude (Ms) of 8.6, which also created a large tsunami. Other
major earthquakes with tsunamis struck the Sanriku Coast region in 1896 and in
1933. In a study of N. Uchida and T. Matsuzawa, it was pointed out that the
source area of this earthquake has a relatively high coupling coefficient
surrounded by areas of relatively low coupling coefficients in the west, north,
and south. From the averaged coupling coefficient of 0.5~0.8 in the source area
and the seismic moment, it was estimated that the slip deficit of this
earthquake was accumulated over a period of 260~880 years, which is consistent
with the recurrence interval of such great earthquakes estimated from the
tsunami deposit data. The seismic moment of this earthquake accounts for about
93% of the estimated cumulative moment from 1926 to March 2011. Hence,
earthquakes with magnitudes about 7 since 1926 in this area only had released
part of the accumulated energy. In the area near the trench, the coupling
coefficient is high, which could act as the source of the large tsunami. Most
of the foreshocks are interplate earthquakes with thrust-type focal mechanisms.
Both interplate and intraplate earthquakes appeared in the aftershocks offshore
Sanriku coast with considerable proportions. The strong ground motion
registered at the maximum of 7 on the Japan Meteorological Agency seismic
intensity scale in Kurihara, Miyagi Prefecture. Three other
prefecturesâ€”Fukushima, Ibaraki and Tochigiâ€”recorded an upper 6 on the JMA
scale. Seismic stations in Iwate, Gunma, Saitama and Chiba Prefecture measured
a lower 6, recording an upper 5 in Tokyo. In Russia, the main shock could be
felt in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk (MSK 4) and Kurilsk (MSK 4). The aftershock at 06:25
UTC could be felt in Yuzhno-Kurilsk (MSK 5) and Kurilsk (MSK 4). Energy. This
earthquake released a surface energy (Me) of joules, dissipated as shaking and
tsunamic energy, which is nearly double that of the 9.1-magnitude 2004 Indian
Ocean earthquake and tsunami that killed 230,000 people. If harnessed, the
surface energy from this earthquake would power a city the size of Los Angeles
for an entire year. The total energy released, also known as the seismic moment
(M0), was more than 200,000 times the surface energy and was calculated by the
USGS at 3.9Ã—1022 joules, slightly less than the 2004 Indian Ocean quake. This
is equivalent to 9,320 gigatons of TNT, or approximately 600 million times the
energy of the Little Boy bomb. Japan's National Research Institute for Earth
Science and Disaster Prevention (NIED) calculated a peak ground acceleration of
2.99 "g" (29.33Â m/sÂ²). The largest individual recording in Japan was 2.7g, in
the Miyagi Prefecture, 75Â km from the epicentre; the highest reading in the
Tokyo metropolitan area was 0.16g. Geophysical effects. The quake moved
portions of northeastern Japan by as much as 2.4Â m (7.9Â ft) closer to North
America, making portions of Japan's landmass wider than before. Portions of
Japan closest to the epicenter experienced the largest shifts. A 400Â km
(250Â mi) stretch of coastline dropped vertically by 0.6Â m (2.0Â ft), allowing
the tsunami to travel farther and faster onto land. One early estimate
suggested that the Pacific plate may have moved westward by up to 20Â m
(66Â ft), and another early estimate put the amount of slippage at as much as
40Â m (130Â ft). On 6 April the Japanese coast guard said that the quake
shifted the seabed near the epicenter 24Â meters (79Â ft) and elevated the
seabed off the coast of Miyagi prefecture by 3Â meters. A report by the Japan
Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology, published in "Science" on 2
December 2011, concluded that the seabed in the area between the epicenter and
the Japan Trench moved 50 meters east-southeast and rose about 7 meters as a
result of the quake. The report also stated that the quake had caused several
major landslides on the seabed in the affected area. The earthquake shifted the
Earth's axis by estimates of between and . This deviation led to a number of
small planetary changes, including the length of a day, the tilt of the Earth,
and the Chandler wobble. The speed of the Earth's rotation increased,
shortening the day by 1.8 microseconds due to the redistribution of Earth's
mass. The axial shift was caused by the redistribution of mass on the Earth's
surface, which changed the planet's moment of inertia. Because of conservation
of angular momentum, such changes of inertia result in small changes to the
Earth's rate of rotation. These are expected changes for an earthquake of this
magnitude. Soil liquefaction was evident in areas of reclaimed land around
Tokyo, particularly in Urayasu, Chiba City, Funabashi, Narashino (all in Chiba
Prefecture) and in the Koto, Edogawa, Minato, ChÅ«Å, and ÅŒta Wards of Tokyo.
Approximately 30 homes or buildings were destroyed and 1,046 other buildings
were damaged to varying degrees. Nearby Haneda Airport, built mostly on
reclaimed land, was not damaged. Odaiba also experienced liquefaction, but
damage was minimal. Shinmoedake, a volcano in Kyushu, erupted two days after
the earthquake. The volcano had previously erupted in January 2011; it is not
known if the later eruption was linked to the earthquake. In Antarctica, the
seismic waves from the earthquake were reported to have caused the Whillans Ice
Stream to slip by about 0.5Â m (1.6Â ft). The first sign international
researchers had that the earthquake caused such a dramatic change in the
Earthâ€™s rotation came from the United States Geographical Survey which
monitors Global Positioning Satellite stations across the world. The Survey
team had several GPS monitors located near the scene of the earthquake. The GPS
station located nearest the epicenter moved almost . This motivated government
researchers to look into other ways the earthquake may have had large scale
effects on the planet. Scientists at NASAâ€™s Jet Propulsion Laboratory did
some calculations and determined that the Earthâ€™s rotation was changed by the
earthquake to the point where the days are now one point eight (1.8)
microseconds shorter. Dr. Richard Gross, one of the head researchers working
for NASA, explained that even a difference of 1.8 microseconds is important to
his team because it affects the way that spacecraft being sent to Mars are
navigated. Not taking the changes into account could increase the chances of
failure of the mission. Gross noted that the way the Earth rotates is not very
smooth, like an old car wobbling on its axle. The earthquake's effect was as if
a person took a hammer and whacked the car's axle, causing it to shift and the
car to drive differently. The powerful earthquake hit the Earthâ€™s axle,
causing it to spin in a slightly different way. Aftershocks. Japan experienced
over 1000 aftershocks since the earthquake, with 80 registering over magnitude
6.0Â Mw and three of which were over magnitude 7.0Â Mw. A magnitude 7.7Â Mw and
a 7.9Â Mw quake occurred on 11 March and the third one struck offshore on 7
April with a disputed magnitude. Its epicenter was underwater, 66Â km (41Â mi)
off the coast of Sendai. The Japan Meteorological Agency assigned a magnitude
of 7.4 MJMA, while the U.S. Geological Survey lowered it to 7.1 Mw. At least
four people were killed, and electricity was cut off across much of northern
Japan including the loss of external power to Higashidori Nuclear Power Plant
and Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant. Four days later on 11 April, another strong
magnitude 6.6 Mw aftershock struck Fukushima, causing additional damage and
killing a total of three people. As of 16 Mar 2012 aftershocks continued,
totaling 1887 events over magnitude 4.0; a regularly updated map showing all
shocks of magnitude 4.5 and above near or off the east coast of Honshu in the
last seven days showed over 20 events. Tsunami. The earthquake, caused by 5 to
8Â meters upthrust on a 180-km wide seabed at 60Â km offshore from the east
coast of TÅhoku, resulted in a major tsunami that brought destruction along
the Pacific coastline of Japan's northern islands. Thousands of lives were lost
when entire towns were devastated. The tsunami propagated throughout the
Pacific Ocean region reaching the entire Pacific coast of North and South
America from Alaska to Chile. Warnings were issued and evacuations carried out
in many countries bordering the Pacific. However, while the tsunami affected
many of these places, the extent was minor. Chile's Pacific coast, one of the
furthest from Japan at about 17,000Â km (11,000Â mi) distant, was struck by
waves 2Â m (6.6Â ft) high, compared with an estimated wave height of
38.9Â meters (128Â ft) at Omoe peninsula, Miyako city, Japan. Japan. The
tsunami warning issued by the Japan Meteorological Agency was the most serious
on its warning scale; it rated as a "major tsunami", being at least 3Â m
(9.8Â ft) high. The actual height prediction varied, the greatest being for
Miyagi at 6Â m (20Â ft) high. The tsunami inundated a total area of
approximately in Japan. The earthquake took place at 14:46 JST around 67Â km
(42Â mi) from the nearest point on Japan's coastline, and initial estimates
indicated the tsunami would have taken 10 to 30Â minutes to reach the areas
first affected, and then areas farther north and south based on the geography
of the coastline. Just over an hour after the earthquake at 15:55 JST, a
tsunami was observed flooding Sendai Airport, which is located near the coast
of Miyagi Prefecture, with waves sweeping away cars and planes and flooding
various buildings as they traveled inland. The image of the tsunami sweeping
cars on the street in Sendai was caught by an in-car camera. The impact of the
tsunami in and around Sendai Airport was filmed by an NHK News helicopter,
showing a number of vehicles on local roads trying to escape the approaching
wave and being engulfed by it. A 4Â m high tsunami hit Iwate Prefecture.
Wakabayashi Ward in Sendai was also particularly hard hit. At least 101
designated tsunami evacuation sites were hit by the wave. Like the 2004 Indian
Ocean earthquake and tsunami, the damage by surging water, though much more
localized, was far more deadly and destructive than the actual quake. There
were reports of entire towns destroyed from tsunami-hit areas in Japan,
including 9,500 missing in Minamisanriku; one thousand bodies had been
recovered in the town by 14 March 2011. Among several factors causing the high
death toll from the tsunami, one was the unexpectedly large size of the water
surge. The tsunami walls at several of the affected cities were based on much
smaller tsunami heights. Also, many people caught in the tsunami thought that
they were located on high enough ground to be safe. Large parts of Kuji and the
southern section of ÅŒfunato including the port area were almost entirely
destroyed Also largely destroyed was Rikuzentakata, where the tsunami was
reportedly three stories high. Other cities reportedly destroyed or heavily
damaged by the tsunami include Kamaishi, Miyako, ÅŒtsuchi, and Yamada (in Iwate
Prefecture), Namie, SÅma and MinamisÅma (in Fukushima Prefecture) and
Shichigahama, Higashimatsushima, Onagawa, Natori, Ishinomaki, and Kesennuma (in
Miyagi Prefecture). The most severe effects of the tsunami were felt along a
670-km (420Â mi)-long stretch of coastline from Erimo, Hokkaido, in the north
to ÅŒarai, Ibaraki, in the south, with most of the destruction in that area
occurring in the hour following the earthquake. Near ÅŒarai, people captured
images of a huge whirlpool that had been generated by the tsunami. The tsunami
washed away the sole bridge to Miyatojima, Miyagi, isolating the island's 900
residents. A two meter high tsunami hit Chiba Prefecture about 2 1/2 hours
after the quake, causing heavy damage to cities such as Asahi. Many areas were
also affected by waves of 1 to 3Â meters (3.3 to 9.8Â ft) in height, and the
JMA bulletin also included the caveat that ""At some parts of the coasts,
tsunamis may be higher than those observed at the observation sites."" The
timing of the earliest recorded tsunami maximum readings ranged from 15:12 to
15:21, between 26 and 35Â minutes after the earthquake had struck. The bulletin
also included initial tsunami observation details, as well as more detailed
maps for the coastlines affected by the tsunami waves. A joint research team
from Yokohama National University and the University of Tokyo also reported
that the tsunami at RyÅri Bay (ç¶¾é‡Œç™½æµœ), ÅŒfunato was about 30Â m high.
They found fishing equipment scattered on the high cliff above the bay. At
TarÅ, Iwate, a University of Tokyo researcher reported an estimated tsunami
height of 37.9Â m (124Â ft) reached the slope of a mountain some 200Â m
(656Â ft) away from the coastline. Also, at slope of nearby mountain from
400Â m (1,312Â ft) Aneyoshi fishery port (å§‰å‰æ¼æ¸¯) of Omoe peninsula
(é‡èŒ‚åŠå³¶) in Miyako, Iwate, Tokyo University of Marine Science and
Technology found estimated tsunami run up height of 38.9Â m (127Â ft). This
height is deemed the record in Japan historically, as of reporting date, that
exceeds 38.2Â m (125Â ft) from the 1896 Meiji-Sanriku earthquake. It was also
estimated that the tsunami reached heights of up to 40.5 metres (133Â ft) in
Miyako in TÅhoku's Iwate Prefecture. The inundated areas closely matched those
of the 869 Sanriku tsunami. A Japanese government study found that only 58% of
people in coastal areas in Iwate, Miyagi, and Fukushima prefectures heeded
tsunami warnings immediately after the quake and headed for higher ground. Of
those who attempted to evacuate after hearing the warning, only five percent
were caught in the tsunami. Of those who didn't heed the warning, 49% were hit
by the water. Elsewhere across the Pacific. Shortly after the earthquake, the
Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) in Hawaii issued tsunami watches and
announcements for locations in the Pacific. At 07:30 UTC, PTWC issued a
widespread tsunami warning covering the entire Pacific Ocean. Russia evacuated
11,000 residents from coastal areas of the Kuril Islands. The United States
West Coast and Alaska Tsunami Warning Center issued a tsunami warning for the
coastal areas in most of California, all of Oregon, and the western part of
Alaska, and a tsunami advisory covering the Pacific coastlines of most of
Alaska, and all of Washington and British Columbia, Canada. In California and
Oregon, up to 2.4Â m (8Â ft) high tsunami surges hit some areas, damaging docks
and harbors and causing over US$10Â million in damage. In Curry County, Oregon
$7Â million in damages occurred including the destruction of of dockspace at
the Brookings harbor; the county has received over $1Â million in FEMA
emergency grants. Surges of up to 1Â m (3.3Â ft) hit Vancouver Island in Canada
prompting some evacuations, and causing boats to be banned from the waters
surrounding the island for 12 hours following the wave strike, leaving many
island residents in the area without means of getting to work. In the
Philippines, waves up to 0.5Â m (1.6Â ft) high hit the eastern seaboard of the
country. Some houses along the coast in Jayapura, Indonesia were destroyed.
Authorities in Wewak, East Sepik, Papua New Guinea evacuated 100 patients from
the city's Boram Hospital before it was hit by the waves, causing an estimated
US$4Â million in damages. Hawaii estimated damage to public infrastructure
alone at US$3Â million, with damage to private properties, including resort
hotels such as Four Seasons Resort Hualalai, estimated at tens of millions of
dollars. It was reported that a 1.5Â m (5Â ft) high wave completely submerged
Midway Atoll's reef inlets and Spit Island, killing more than 110,000 nesting
seabirds at the Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge. Some other South Pacific
countries, including Tonga and New Zealand, and U.S. territories American Samoa
and Guam, experienced larger-than-normal waves, but did not report any major
damage. However in Guam some roads were closed off and people were evacuated
from low-lying areas. Along the Pacific Coast of Mexico and South America,
tsunami surges were reported, but in most places caused little or no damage.
Peru reported a wave of 1.5Â m (5Â ft) and more than 300 homes damaged. The
surge in Chile was large enough to damage more than 200 houses, with waves of
up to 3Â m (9.8Â ft). In the Galapagos Islands, 260 families received
assistance following a 3Â m (9.8Â ft) surge which arrived 20 hours after the
earthquake, after the tsunami warning had been lifted. There was a great deal
of damage to buildings on the islands and one man was injured but there were no
reported fatalities. The tsunami broke icebergs off the Sulzberger Ice Shelf in
Antarctica, away. The main iceberg measured (approximately the area of
Manhattan Island) and about thick. A total of of ice broke away. As of April
2012, wreckage from the tsunami spread around the oceans, including a soccer
ball which was found in Alaska and a Japanese motorcycle found in British
Columbia, Canada Land subsidence. Geospatial Information Authority of Japan
reported land subsidence on the height of triangulation station measured by GPS
from previous value on 14 April 2011. Scientists say that the subsidence is
permanent. As a result, the communities in question are now more susceptible to
flooding during high tides. Casualties. The National Police Agency has
confirmed and across twenty prefectures. Of the 13,135 fatalities recovered by
11 April 2011, 12,143 or 92.5% died by drowning. Victims aged 60 or older
accounted for 65.2% of the deaths, with 24% of total victims being in their
70s. As of March 2012, Japanese police data showed that 70% of the 3,279 still
missing were aged 60 or over, including 893 in their 70s and 577 in their 80s.
Of the total confirmed victims, 14,308 drowned, 667 were crushed to death or
died from internal injuries, and 145 perished from burns. Save the Children
reports that as many as 100,000 children were uprooted from their homes, some
of whom were separated from their families because the earthquake occurred
during the school day. 236 children were orphaned in the prefectures of Iwate,
Miyagi and Fukushima by the disaster; 1,580 children lost either one or both
parents, 846 in Miyagi, 572 in Iwate, and 162 in Fukushima. The quake and
tsunami killed 378 elementary, middle-school, and high school students and left
158 others missing. One elementary school in Ishinomaki, Miyagi, Okawa
Elementary, lost 74 of 108 students and 10 of 13 teachers and staff. The
Japanese Foreign Ministry has confirmed the deaths of nineteen foreigners.
Among them are two English teachers from the United States affiliated with the
Japan Exchange and Teaching Program; a Canadian missionary in Shiogama; and
citizens of China, North and South Korea, Taiwan, Pakistan and the Philippines.
By 9:30 UTC on 11 March, Google Person Finder, which was previously used in the
Haitian, Chilean, and Christchurch, New Zealand earthquakes, was collecting
information about survivors and their locations. The Next of Kin Registry
(NOKR) is assisting the Japanese government in locating next of kin for those
missing or deceased. Japanese funerals are normally elaborate Buddhist
ceremonies which entail cremation. The thousands of bodies, however, exceeded
the capacity of available crematoriums and morgues, many of them damaged, and
there were shortages of both keroseneâ€”each cremation requires
50Â litersâ€”and dry ice for preservation. The single crematorium in
Higashimatsushima, for example, could only handle four bodies a day, although
hundreds were found there. Governments and the military were forced to bury
many bodies in hastily dug mass graves with rudimentary or no rites, although
relatives of the deceased were promised that they would be cremated later. The
tsunami is reported to have caused several deaths outside of Japan. One man was
killed in Jayapura, Papua, Indonesia after being swept out to sea. A man who is
said to have been attempting to photograph the oncoming tsunami at the mouth of
the Klamath River, south of Crescent City, California, was swept out to sea.
His body was found on 2 April along Ocean Beach in Fort Stevens State Park,
Oregon, some to the north. Noted individual fatalities within Japan included
104-year old Takashi Shimokawara, holder of the world athletics records in the
men's shot put, discus throw and javelin throw for the over-100s age category.
He was killed by the earthquake and tsunami at Kamaishi, Iwate. As of 27 May
2011, three Japan Ground Self-Defense Force members had died while conducting
relief operations in TÅhoku. As of March 2012, the Japanese government had
recognized 1,331 deaths as indirectly related to the earthquake, such as caused
by harsh living conditions after the disaster. As of 30 April 2012, 18 people
had died and 420 had been injured while participating in disaster recovery or
clean-up efforts. Damage and effects. The degree and extent of damage caused by
the earthquake and resulting tsunami were enormous, with most of the damage
being caused by the tsunami. Video footage of the towns that were worst
affected shows little more than piles of rubble, with almost no parts of any
structures left standing. Estimates of the cost of the damage range well into
the tens of billions of US dollars; before-and-after satellite photographs of
devastated regions show immense damage to many regions. Although Japan has
invested the equivalent of billions of dollars on anti-tsunami seawalls which
line at least 40% of its 34,751Â km (21,593Â mi) coastline and stand up to
12Â m (39Â ft) high, the tsunami simply washed over the top of some seawalls,
collapsing some in the process. Japan's National Police Agency said on 3 April
2011, that 45,700 buildings were destroyed and 144,300 were damaged by the
quake and tsunami. The damaged buildings included 29,500 structures in Miyagi
Prefecture, 12,500 in Iwate Prefecture and 2,400 in Fukushima Prefecture. Three
hundred hospitals with 20 beds or more in TÅhoku were damaged by the disaster,
with 11 being completely destroyed. The earthquake and tsunami created an
estimated 24â€“25Â million tons of rubble and debris in Japan. An estimated
230,000 automobiles and trucks were damaged or destroyed in the disaster. As of
the end of May 2011, residents of Iwate, Miyagi, and Fukushima prefectures had
requested deregistration of 15,000 vehicles, meaning that the owners of those
vehicles were writing them off as unrepairable or unsalvageable. Ports. All of
Japan's ports were briefly closed after the earthquake, though the ones in
Tokyo and southwards soon re-opened. Fifteen ports were located in the disaster
zone. The north-eastern ports of Hachinohe, Sendai, Ishinomaki and Onahama were
destroyed, while the Port of Chiba (which serves the hydrocarbon industry) and
Japan's ninth-largest container port at Kashima were also affected though less
severely. The ports at Hitachinaka, Hitachi, Soma, Shiogama, Kesennuma,
Ofunato, Kamashi and Miyako were also damaged and closed to ships. All 15 ports
reopened to limited ship traffic by 29 March 2011. A total of 319 fishing
ports, about 10% of Japan's fishing ports, were damaged in the disaster. Most
were restored to operating condition by 18 April 2012. The Port of Tokyo
suffered slight damage; the effects of the quake included visible smoke rising
from a building in the port with parts of the port areas being flooded,
including soil liquefaction in Tokyo Disneyland's parking lot. Dams and water.
The Fujinuma irrigation dam in Sukagawa ruptured, causing flooding and washing
away five homes. Eight people were missing and four bodies were discovered by
the morning. Reportedly, some locals had attempted to repair leaks in the dam
before it completely failed. On 12 March, 252 dams were inspected and it was
discovered that six embankment dams had shallow cracks on their crests. The
reservoir at one concrete gravity dam suffered a small non-serious slope
failure. All damaged dams are functioning with no problems. Four dams within
the quake area were unreachable. When the roads clear, experts will be
dispatched to conduct further investigations. In the immediate aftermath of the
calamity, at least 1.5Â million households were reported to have lost access to
water supplies. By 21 March 2011, this number fell to 1.04Â million.
Electricity. According to the Japanese trade ministry, around 4.4Â million
households served by TÅhoku Electric Power (TEP) in northeastern Japan were
left without electricity. Several nuclear and conventional power plants went
offline after the earthquake, reducing TEPCO's total capacity by 21 GW. Rolling
blackouts began on 14 March due to power shortages caused by the earthquake.
The Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), which normally provides approximately
40 GW of electricity, announced that it can currently provide only about 30 GW.
This is because 40% of the electricity used in the greater Tokyo area is now
supplied by reactors in the Niigata and Fukushima prefectures. The reactors at
the Fukushima Daiichi and Fukushima Dai-ni plants were automatically taken
offline when the first earthquake occurred and have sustained major damage
related to the earthquake and subsequent tsunami. Rolling blackouts of
approximately three hours were experienced throughout April and May while TEPCO
scrambled to find a temporary power solution. The blackouts affected Tokyo,
Kanagawa, Eastern Shizuoka, Yamanashi, Chiba, Ibaraki, Saitama, Tochigi, and
Gunma prefectures. Voluntary reduced electricity use by consumers in the Kanto
area helped reduce the predicted frequency and duration of the blackouts. By 21
March 2011, the number of households in the north without electricity fell to
242,927. TÅhoku Electric Power was not able to provide the Kanto region with
additional power, because TEP's power plants were also damaged in the
earthquake. Kansai Electric Power Company (Kepco) cannot share electricity,
because its system operates at 60 hertz, whereas TEPCO and TEP operate their
systems at 50 hertz; this is due to early industrial and infrastructure
development in the 1880s that left Japan without a unified national power grid.
Two substations, one in Shizuoka Prefecture and one in Nagano Prefecture, were
able to convert between frequencies and transfer electricity from Kansai to
Kanto and TÅhoku, but their capacity to do so is limited to 1 GW. With the
damage to so many power plants, it may be years before a long-term solution can
be found. In effort to help alleviate the shortage, three steel manufacturers
in the Kanto region are contributing electricity produced by their in-house
conventional power stations to TEPCO for distribution to the general public.
Sumitomo Metal Industries can produce up to 500 MW, JFE Steel 400 MW, and
Nippon Steel 500 MW of electric power Auto and auto parts makers in Kanto and
Tohoku agreed in May 2011 to operate their factories on Saturdays and Sundays
and close on Thursdays and Fridays to assist in alleviating the electricity
shortage during the summer of 2011. Oil, gas and coal. A -per-day oil refinery
of Cosmo Oil Company was set on fire by the quake at Ichihara, Chiba
Prefecture, to the east of Tokyo. It was extinguished after ten days, killing
or injuring six people, and destroying storage tanks. Others halted production
due to safety checks and power loss. In Sendai, a -per-day refinery owned by
the largest refiner in Japan, JX Nippon Oil & Energy, was also set ablaze by
the quake. Workers were evacuated, but tsunami warnings hindered efforts to
extinguish the fire until 14 March, when officials planned to do so. An analyst
estimates that consumption of various types of oil may increase by as much as
per day (as well as LNG), as back-up power plants burning fossil fuels try to
compensate for the loss of 11 GW of Japan's nuclear power capacity. The city-
owned plant for importing liquefied natural gas in Sendai was severely damaged,
and supplies were halted for at least a month. In addition to refining and
storage, several power plants were damaged. These include Sendai #4, New-Sendai
#1 and #2, Haranomachi #1 and #2, Hirono #2 and #4 and Hitachinaka #1. Nuclear
power plants. The Fukushima Daiichi, Fukushima Daini, Onagawa Nuclear Power
Plant and TÅkai nuclear power stations, consisting of a total eleven reactors,
were automatically shut down following the earthquake. HigashidÅri, also on
the northeast coast, was already shut down for a periodic inspection. Cooling
is needed to remove decay heat after a reactor has been shut down, and to
maintain spent fuel pools. The backup cooling process is powered by emergency
diesel generators at the plants and at Rokkasho nuclear reprocessing plant. At
Fukushima Daiichi and Daini tsunami waves overtopped seawalls and destroyed
diesel backup power systems, leading to severe problems at Fukushima Daiichi,
including three large explosions and radioactive leakage. Over 200,000 people
were evacuated. The 7 April aftershock caused the loss of external power to
Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant and Higashidori Nuclear Power Plant but backup
generators were functional. Onagawa Nuclear Power Plant lost 3 of 4 external
power lines and lost cooling function for as much as 80Â minutes. A spill of a
couple liters of radioactive water occurred at Onagawa. Europe's Energy
Commissioner GÃ¼nther Oettinger addressed the European Parliament on 15 March,
explaining that the nuclear disaster was an "apocalypse". As the nuclear crisis
entered a second month, experts recognized that Fukushima Daiichi is not the
worst nuclear accident ever, but it is the most complicated. Nuclear experts
stated that Fukushima will go down in history as the second-worst nuclear
accident ever... while not as bad as Chernobyl disaster, worse than Three Mile
Island accident. It could take months or years to learn how damaging the
release of dangerous isotopes has been to human health and food supplies, and
the surrounding countryside. Later analysis indicated three reactors (Units 1,
2, and 3) had suffered meltdowns and continued to leak coolant water, and by
summer the Vice-minister for Economy, Trade and Industry, the head of the
Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, and the head of the Agency for Natural
Resources and Energy, had lost their jobs. Fukushima meltdowns. Japan declared
a state of emergency following the failure of the cooling system at the
Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, resulting in the evacuation of nearby
residents. Officials from the Japanese Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency
reported that radiation levels inside the plant were up to 1,000 times normal
levels, and that radiation levels outside the plant were up to 8 times normal
levels. Later, a state of emergency was also declared at the Fukushima Daini
nuclear power plant about 11Â km (7Â mi) south. This brought the total number
of problematic reactors to six. It was reported that radioactive iodine was
detected in the tap water in Fukushima, Tochigi, Gunma, Tokyo, Chiba, Saitama,
and Niigata, and radioactive cesium in the tap water in Fukushima, Tochigi and
Gunma. Radioactive cesium, iodine, and strontium were also detected in the soil
in some places in Fukushima. There may be a need to replace the contaminated
soil. Many radioactive hotspots were found outside the evacuation zone,
including Tokyo. Food products were also found contaminated by radioactive
matter in several places in Japan. On 5 April 2011, the government of the
Ibaraki Prefecture banned the fishing of sand lance after discovering that this
species was contaminated by radioactive cesium above legal limits. As late as
July radioactive beef was found for sale at Tokyo markets. Incidents elsewhere.
A fire occurred in the turbine section of the Onagawa Nuclear Power Plant
following the earthquake. The blaze was in a building housing the turbine,
which is sited separately from the plant's reactor, and was soon extinguished.
The plant was shut down as a precaution. On 13 March the lowest-level state of
emergency was declared regarding the Onagawa plant as radioactivity readings
temporarily exceeded allowed levels in the area of the plant. Tohoku Electric
Power Co. stated this may have been due to radiation from the Fukushima Daiichi
nuclear accidents but was not from the Onagawa plant itself. As a result of the
7 April aftershock, Onagawa Nuclear Power Plant lost 3 of 4 external power
lines and lost cooling function for as much as 80Â minutes. A spill of a couple
liters of radioactive water occurred at Onagawa. The number 2 reactor at TÅkai
Nuclear Power Plant was shut down automatically. On 14 March it was reported
that a cooling system pump for this reactor had stopped working; however, the
Japan Atomic Power Company stated that there was a second operational pump
sustaining the cooling systems, but that two of three diesel generators used to
power the cooling system were out of order. Wind power. None of Japan's
commercial wind turbines, totaling over 2300 MW in nameplate capacity, failed
as a result of the earthquake and tsunami, including the Kamisu offshore wind
farm directly hit by the tsunami. Transport. Japan's transport network suffered
severe disruptions. Many sections of TÅhoku Expressway serving northern Japan
were damaged. The expressway did not reopen to general public use until 24
March 2011. All railway services were suspended in Tokyo, with an estimated
20,000 people stranded at major stations across the city. In the hours after
the earthquake, some train services were resumed. Most Tokyo area train lines
resumed full service by the next dayâ€”12 March. Twenty thousand stranded
visitors spent the night of 11â€“12 March inside Tokyo Disneyland. A tsunami
wave flooded Sendai Airport at 15:55 JST, about 1 hour after the initial quake,
causing severe damage. Narita and Haneda Airport both briefly suspended
operations after the quake, but suffered little damage and reopened within 24
hours. Eleven airliners bound for Narita were diverted to nearby Yokota Air
Base. Various train services around Japan were also canceled, with JR East
suspending all services for the rest of the day. Four trains on coastal lines
were reported as being out of contact with operators; one, a four-car train on
the Senseki Line, was found to have derailed, and its occupants were rescued
shortly after 8Â am the next morning. Minami-Kesennuma Station on the Kesennuma
Line was obliterated save for its platform; 62 of 70 (31 of 35) JR East train
lines suffered damage to some degree; in the worst-hit areas, 23 stations on 7
lines were washed away, with damage or loss of track in 680 locations and the
30-km radius around the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant unable to be assessed.
There were no derailments of Shinkansen bullet train services in and out of
Tokyo, but their services were also suspended. The TÅkaidÅ Shinkansen resumed
limited service late in the day and was back to its normal schedule by the next
day, while the JÅetsu and Nagano Shinkansen resumed services late on 12 March.
Services on Yamagata Shinkansen resumed with limited numbers of trains on 31
March. The TÅhoku Shinkansen line was worst hit, with JR East estimating that
1,100 sections of the line, varying from collapsed station roofs to bent power
pylons, will need repairs. Services on the TÅhoku Shinkansen partially resumed
only in KantÅ area on 15 March, with one round-trip service per hour between
Tokyo and Nasu-Shiobara, and TÅhoku area service partially resumed on 22 March
between Morioka and Shin-Aomori. Services on Akita Shinkansen resumed with
limited numbers of trains on 18 March. Service between Tokyo and Shin-Aomori
was restored by May, but at lower speeds due to ongoing restoration work; the
pre-earthquake timetable was not reinstated until late September. The rolling
blackouts brought on by the crises at the nuclear power plants in Fukushima had
a profound effect on the rail networks around Tokyo starting on 14 March. Major
railways began running trains at 10â€“20Â minute intervals, rather than the
usual 3â€“5Â minute intervals, operating some lines only at rush hour and
completely shutting down others; notably, the Tokaido Main Line, Yokosuka Line,
Sobu Main Line and ChÅ«Å-SÅbu Line were all stopped for the day. This led to
near-paralysis within the capital, with long lines at train stations and many
people unable to come to work or get home. Railway operators gradually
increased capacity over the next few days, until running at approximately 80%
capacity by 17 March and relieving the worst of the passenger congestion.
Telecommunications. Cellular and landline phone service suffered major
disruptions in the affected area. On the day of the quake, American broadcaster
NPR was unable to reach anyone in Sendai with working phone or Internet.
Internet services were largely unaffected in areas where basic infrastructure
remained, despite the earthquake having damaged portions of several undersea
cable systems landing in the affected regions; these systems were able to
reroute around affected segments onto redundant links. Within Japan, only a few
websites were initially unreachable. Several Wi-Fi hotspot providers reacted to
the quake by providing free access to their networks, and some American
telecommunications and VoIP companies such as AT&T, Sprint, Verizon, T-Mobile
and VoIP companies such as netTALK and Vonage have offered free calls to (and
in some cases, from) Japan for a limited time, as did Germany's Deutsche
Telekom. Defense. Matsushima Air Field of the Japan Self-Defense Force in
Miyagi Prefecture was struck by the tsunami, flooding the base and resulting in
damage to all 18 Mitsubishi F-2 fighter jets of the 21st Fighter Training
Squadron. 12 of the aircraft were scrapped, while the remaining 6 were slated
for repair at a cost of 80 billion yen ($1 billion), exceeding the original
cost of the aircraft. At the 2nd Regional Headquarters of the Japan Coast Guard
in Shiogama, Miyagi, 2 patrol boats were swept away. Space center. JAXA (Japan
Aerospace Exploration Agency) evacuated the Tsukuba Space Center in Tsukuba,
Ibaraki. The Center, which houses a control room for part of the International
Space Station, was shut down and some damage was reported. The Tsukuba control
center resumed full operations for the space station's Kibo laboratory and the
HTV cargo craft on 21 March 2011. Cultural Properties. 754 Cultural Properties
were damaged across nineteen prefectures, including five National Treasures (at
Zuigan-ji, ÅŒsaki Hachiman-gÅ«, Shiramizu AmidadÅ, and Seihaku-ji); 160
Important Cultural Properties (including at Sendai TÅshÅ-gÅ«, the KÅdÅkan,
and EntsÅ«-in, with its western decorative motifs); one hundred and forty-four
Monuments of Japan (including Matsushima, Takata-matsubara, YÅ«bikan, and the
Site of TagajÅ); six Groups of Traditional Buildings; and four Important
Tangible Folk Cultural Properties. Stone monuments at the UNESCO World Heritage
Site: Shrines and Temples of NikkÅ were toppled. In Tokyo, there was damage to
Koishikawa KÅrakuen, Rikugien, HamarikyÅ« Onshi Teien, and the walls of Edo
Castle. Information on the condition of collections held by museums, libraries
and archives is still incomplete. There was no damage to the Historic Monuments
and Sites of Hiraizumi in Iwate prefecture, and the recommendation for their
inscription on the UNESCO World Heritage List in June was seized upon as a
symbol of international recognition and recovery. Aftermath. The aftermath of
the earthquake and tsunami included both a humanitarian crisis and a major
economic impact. The tsunami resulted in over 340,000 displaced people in the
TÅhoku region, and shortages of food, water, shelter, medicine and fuel for
survivors. In response the Japanese government mobilized the Self-Defence
Forces, while many countries sent search and rescue teams to help search for
survivors. Aid organizations both in Japan and worldwide also responded, with
the Japanese Red Cross reporting $1Â billion in donations. The economic impact
included both immediate problems, with industrial production suspended in many
factories, and the longer term issue of the cost of rebuilding which has been
estimated at Â¥10Â trillion ($122Â billion). In comparison to the 1995 Great
Hanshin earthquake, the East Japan Earthquake brought serious damage to an
extremely wide range. Media coverage. Japan's national public broadcaster, NHK,
and Japan Satellite Television suspended their usual programming to provide
ongoing coverage of the situation. Other nationwide Japanese TV networks also
broadcast uninterrupted coverage of the disaster. Ustream Asia broadcast live
feeds of NHK, Tokyo Broadcasting System, Fuji TV, TV Asahi, TV Kanagawa, and
CNN on the Internet starting on 12 March 2011. YokosoNews, an Internet webcast
in Japan, dedicated its broadcast to the latest news gathered from Japanese
news stations, translating them in real time to English. All warnings were
broadcast by NHK in five languages: Japanese, English, Mandarin, Korean and
Portuguese (Japan has small Chinese, Korean and Brazilian populations). It was
noted that the Japanese news media has been at times overly cautious to avoid
panic and reliant on confusing statements by experts and officials. In this
national crisis, the Japanese government provided Japanese sign language (JSL)
interpreting at the press conferences related to the earthquake and tsunami.
Television broadcasts of the press conferences of Prime Minister Naoto Kan and
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano included simultaneous JSL interpreters
standing next to the Japanese flag on the same platform. According to Jake
Adelstein, most Japanese media accepted and parroted the misinformation put out
by the Japanese government and TEPCO about the unfolding Fukushima nuclear
crisis. Notable exceptions, according to Adelstein, were newspapers "Sankei
Shimbun" and "Chunichi Shimbun" which questioned the accuracy of the
information coming from the government and TEPCO. Because of the unquestioning
nature of most Japanese media to hold to the "party line", many Japanese mid-
level officials and experts spoke to foreign media to get their opinions and
observations publicized. Scientific and research response. A large amount of
data was collected that provides "the possibility to model in great detail what
happened during the rupture of an earthquake." The effect of this data is
expected to be felt across other disciplines as well, and this disaster "would
provide unprecedented information about how buildings hold up under long
periods of shaking â€“ and thus how to build them better. Seismologists had
anticipated that the "big one" would strike the same place as the 1923 Great
KantÅ earthquakeâ€”in the Sagami Trough, southwest of Tokyo. Since 1976, when
Katsuhiko Ishibashi said a large earthquake in the Suruga Trough was
forthcoming, the government tracked plate movements, in preparation for the so-
called Tokai earthquake. Occurring 373Â km (232Â mi) northeast of Tokyo, the
TÅhoku earthquake came as a surprise to seismologists, since the Japan Trench
was known for creating large quakes, but was not expected to generate quakes
above an 8.0 magnitude.
