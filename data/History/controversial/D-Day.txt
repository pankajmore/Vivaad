Normandy landings The Normandy landings, codenamed Operation Neptune, were the
landing operations of the Allied invasion of Normandy, in Operation Overlord,
during World War II. The landings commenced on Tuesday, 6 June 1944 (D-Day),
beginning at 6:30Â am British Double Summer Time (GMT+2). In planning, as for
most Allied operations, the term "D-Day" was used for the day of the actual
landing, which was dependent on final approval. The landings were conducted in
two phases: an airborne assault landing of 24,000 British, American, Canadian
and Free French airborne troops shortly after midnight, and an amphibious
landing of Allied infantry and armoured divisions on the coast of France
starting at 6:30Â am. Surprise was achieved thanks to inclement weather and a
comprehensive deception plan implemented in the months before the landings,
Operation Bodyguard, to distract German attention from the possibility of
landings in Normandy. A key success was to convince Adolf Hitler that the
landings would actually occur to the north near Calais. There were also decoy
operations simultaneous with the landings under the codenames Operation Glimmer
and Operation Taxable to distract the German forces from the real landing
areas. Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces was General Dwight
Eisenhower while overall command of ground forces (21st Army Group) was given
to General Bernard Montgomery. The operation, planned by a team under
Lieutenant-General Frederick Morgan, was the largest amphibious invasion in
world history and was executed by land, sea, and air elements under direct
British command with over 160,000 troops landing on 6 June 1944, 73,000
American troops, 61,715 British and 21,400 Canadian. 195,700 Allied naval and
merchant navy personnel in over 5,000 ships were involved. The invasion
required the transport of soldiers and material from the United Kingdom by
troop-laden aircraft and ships, the assault landings, air support, naval
interdiction of the English Channel and naval fire-support. The landings took
place along a stretch of the Normandy coast divided into five sectors: Utah,
Omaha, Gold, Juno, and Sword. Operations. "The armed forces used codenames to
refer to the planning and execution of specific military operations. Operation
Overlord was the codename for the Allied invasion of northwest Europe. The
assault phase of Operation Overlord was known as Operation Neptune. Operation
Neptune began on D-Day (June 6, 1944) and ended on June 30, 1944. By this time,
the Allies had established a firm foothold in Normandy. Operation Overlord also
began on D-Day, and continued until Allied forces crossed the River Seine on
August 19, 1944." Just prior to the invasion, General Eisenhower transmitted a
now-historic message to all members of the Allied Expeditionary Force. It read,
in part, "You are about to embark upon the great crusade, toward which we have
striven these many months." In his pocket was a statement, never used, to be
read in case the invasion failed. Deception plans. Under the high-level plan
Operation Bodyguard the Allies had instituted a comprehensive and complex
series of deception operations which led to the landings achieving strategic
and tactical surprise. One of the key successes of these operations was
Operation Fortitude South which convinced Hitler that the Allies' plan was for
their main attack to be across the Straits of Dover by the fictitious First
United States Army Group to be led by George S. Patton and that the Normandy
landings were a diversionary tactic. The fiction was maintained after the
Normandy landings to the effect that Hitler, still believing an attack was
imminent across the straits, was unwilling until it was too late to reinforce
his troops in Normandy with forces placed to defend the Pas de Calais.
Particularly relevant to the Normandy landings was the use of heavy bombers in
Operations Glimmer and Taxable which flew in highly precise patterns over the
Straits of Dover, to drop radar-reflecting aluminium strips ("window", or
chaff) to create a picture on German radar of an invasion fleet moving across
the straits simultaneous to the arrival of the invasion fleet in Normandy.
Weather. Only 10 days each month were suitable for launching the operation: a
day near the full Moon was needed both for illumination during the hours of
darkness and for the spring tide, the former to illuminate navigational
landmarks for the crews of aircraft, gliders and landing craft, and the latter
to provide the deepest possible water to help safe navigation over defensive
obstacles placed by the German forces in the surf on the seaward approaches to
the beaches. A full moon occurred on 6 June. Allied Expeditionary Force Supreme
Commander Dwight D. Eisenhower had tentatively selected 5 June as the date for
the assault. The weather was fine during most of May, but deteriorated in early
June. On 4 June, conditions were clearly unsuitable for a landing; wind and
high seas would make it impossible to launch landing craft from larger ships at
sea, and low clouds would prevent aircraft finding their targets. The Allied
troop convoys already at sea were forced to take shelter in bays and inlets on
the south coast of Britain for the night. It seemed possible that everything
would have to be cancelled and the troops returned to their embarkation camps
(which would be almost impossible, as the enormous movement of follow-up
formations into them was already proceeding). The next full moon period would
be nearly a month away. At a vital meeting on 5 June, Eisenhower's chief
meteorologist (Group Captain J.M. Stagg) forecast a brief improvement for 6
June. Commander of all land forces for the invasion General Bernard Montgomery
and Eisenhower's Chief of Staff General Walter Bedell Smith wished to proceed
with the invasion. Commander of the Allied Air Forces Air Chief Marshal Leigh
Mallory was doubtful, but the Allied Naval supremo Admiral Bertram Ramsay
believed that conditions would be marginally favorable. On the strength of
Stagg's forecast, Eisenhower ordered the invasion to proceed. As a result,
prevailing overcast skies limited Allied air support, and no serious damage was
done to the beach defences on Omaha and Juno. The Germans meanwhile took
comfort from the existing poor conditions, which were worse over Northern
France than over the Channel itself, and believed no invasion would be possible
for several days. Some troops stood down, and many senior officers were away
for the weekend. Field Marshal Erwin Rommel took a few days' leave to celebrate
his wife's birthday, while dozens of division, regimental, and battalion
commanders were away from their posts conducting war games just prior to the
invasion. Allied order of battle. British Second Army. Overall, the 2nd Army
contingent consisted of 83,115 troops (61,715 of them British). In addition to
the British and Canadian combat units, eight Australian officers were attached
to the British forces as eyewitnesses. The nominally British air and naval
support units included a large number of crew from Allied nations, including
several RAF squadrons manned almost exclusively by overseas air-crew. For
instance, the Australian contribution to the operation included a regular Royal
Australian Air Force (RAAF) squadron, nine Article XV squadrons and hundreds of
personnel posted to RAF units and RN warships. U.S. First Army. In total, the
First Army contingent totalled approximately 73,000 men, including 15,600 from
the airborne divisions. German order of battle. The military forces at the
disposal of Nazi Germany reached its numerical peak during 1944. By D-Day, 157
German divisions were stationed in the Soviet Union, 6 in Finland, 12 in
Norway, 6 in Denmark, 9 in Germany, 21 in the Balkans, 26 in Italy and 59 in
France, Belgium and the Netherlands. However, these statistics are somewhat
misleading since a significant number of the divisions in the east were
depleted due to intensity of fighting; German records indicate that the average
personnel complement was at about 50% in the spring of 1944. German defenses.
The German defenses used an interlocking firing style, so they could protect
areas that were receiving heavy fire. They had large bunkers, sometimes
intricate concrete ones containing machine guns and large-calibre weapons.
Their defence also integrated the cliffs and hills overlooking the beaches. The
defenses were all built and refined over a four year period. Atlantic Wall. The
Germans' first line of defense was the English Channel, a crossing which had
confounded both the Spanish Armada and Napoleon Bonaparte's Navy. Multiplying
the invasion obstacles was the extensive Atlantic Wall, ordered by Hitler in
his Directive 51 which stretched from Belgium to Spain in varying degrees, but
was most elaborate facing the English channel. Believing that any forthcoming
landings would be timed for high tide, Rommel had the entire wall fortified
with pill boxes, artillery, machine gun positions and extensive barbed wire as
well as laying hundreds of thousands of mines to deter landing craft. The
Allies chose not to attack at Calais but at the more distant beaches of
Normandy which was also the sector boundary between the 7th and 15th German
armies, on the extreme eastern flank of the former, to maximize the possible
confusion of command responsibility during German reaction. The landings sector
which was attacked was occupied by four German divisions. The attacks were
timed for low tide because it minimized the effectiveness of landing obstacles
which were likely to have resulted in drowned troops; many landing craft would
have been hulled and sunk during the final approach. However, this stratagem
exposed the infantry to defensive fire over a greater distance of beach sand.
Armoured reserves. Rommel's defensive measures were also frustrated by a
dispute over armoured doctrine. In addition to his two army groups, von
Rundstedt also commanded the headquarters of "Panzer Group West" under General
Leo Geyr von Schweppenburg (usually referred to as "von Geyr"). This formation
was nominally an administrative HQ for von Rundstedt's armoured and mobile
formations, but it was later to be renamed Fifth Panzer Army and brought into
the line in Normandy. Von Geyr and Rommel disagreed over the deployment and use
of the vital Panzer divisions. Rommel recognised that the Allies would possess
air superiority and would be able to harass his movements from the air. He
therefore proposed that the armoured formations be deployed close to the
invasion beaches. In his words, it was better to have one Panzer division
facing the invaders on the first day, than three Panzer divisions three days
later when the Allies would already have established a firm beachhead. Von Geyr
argued for the standard doctrine that the Panzer formations should be
concentrated in a central position around Paris and Rouen, and deployed "en
masse" against the main Allied beachhead when this had been identified. The
argument was eventually brought before Hitler for arbitration. He
characteristically imposed an unworkable compromise solution. Only three Panzer
divisions were given to Rommel, too few to cover all the threatened sectors.
The remainder, nominally under Von Geyr's control, were actually designated as
being in "OKW Reserve". Only three of these were deployed close enough to
intervene immediately against any invasion of Northern France, the other four
were dispersed in southern France and the Netherlands. Hitler reserved to
himself the authority to move the divisions in OKW Reserve, or commit them to
action. On 6 June, many Panzer division commanders were unable to move because
Hitler had not given the necessary authorization, and his staff refused to wake
him upon news of the invasion. The other mechanized divisions capable of
intervening in Normandy were retained under the direct control of the German
Armed Forces HQ (OKW) and were initially denied to Rommel. Coordination with
the French Resistance. The resistance was alerted to carry out these tasks by
means of the "messages personnels", transmitted by the BBC in its French
service from London. Several hundred of these were regularly transmitted,
masking the few of them that were really significant. Among the stream of
apparently meaningless messages broadcast by the BBC at 21:00 CET on 5 June
were coded instructions such as "Les carottes sont cuites" ("The carrots are
cooked") and "Les dÃ©s sont jetÃ©s" ("The dice have been thrown"). One famous
pair of these messages is often mistakenly stated to be a general call to arms
by the Resistance. A few days before D-Day, the (slightly misquoted) first line
of Verlaine's poem, "Chanson d'Automne", was transmitted. ""Les sanglots longs
des violons de l'automne"" ("Long sobs of autumn violins") alerted the
resistance fighters of the "Ventriloquist" network in the OrlÃ©ans region to
attack rail targets within the next few days. The second line, ""Bercent mon
coeur d'une langueur monotone"" ("soothe my heart with a monotonous languor"),
transmitted late on 5 June, meant that the attack was to be mounted
immediately. Josef GÃ¶tz, the head of the signals section of the German
intelligence service (the SD) in Paris, had discovered the meaning of the
second line of Verlaine's poem, and no fewer than fourteen other executive
orders they heard late on 5 June. His section rightly interpreted them to mean
that an invasion was imminent or underway, and they alerted their superiors and
all Army commanders in France. However, they had issued a similar warning a
month before, when the Allies had begun invasion preparations and alerted the
Resistance, but then stood down because of a forecast of bad weather. The SD
having given this false alarm, their genuine alarm was ignored or treated as
merely routine. Fifteenth Army HQ passed the information on to its units;
Seventh Army ignored it. In addition to the tasks given to the Resistance as
part of the invasion effort, the Special Operations Executive planned to
reinforce the Resistance with three-man liaison parties, under Operation
Jedburgh. The "Jedburgh" parties would coordinate and arrange supply drops to
the Maquis groups in the German rear areas. Also operating far behind German
lines and frequently working closely with the Resistance, although not under
SOE, were larger parties from the British, French and Belgian units of the
Special Air Service brigade. A 1968 report from the Counter-insurgency
Information Analysis Center details the results of the French Resistance's
sabotage efforts: "In the southeast, 52 locomotives were destroyed on 6 June
and the railway line cut in more than 500 places. Normandy was isolated as of 7
June. The telephone network in the invasion area was put out of order and
beginning June 20, the railway lines of France were rendered inoperable, except
in the Rhone Valley where the line Marseilles-Lyon was kept open by the Germans
despite heavy engagements with units... Although the German local reserves were
able to reach the front area despite resistance action... marked delays were
achieved against the movement of strategic reserves. The French claim to have
delayed up to 12 divisions for 8 to 15 days" Naval activity. Operation Neptune,
as the naval part of the D-Day invasion was known primarily as a Royal Navy
affair, both in planning and execution. This is widely considered â€˜"a never
surpassed masterpiece of planningâ€™". In overall command was Admiral Sir
Bertram Ramsay, who as Flag Officer Dover had controlled the evacuation of over
300,000 troops from Dunkirk four years earlier. He had also been responsible
for the naval planning of the invasion of North Africa in 1942 and one of the
two fleets carrying troops for the invasion of Sicily in the following year.
The invasion fleet was drawn from eight different navies, comprising 6,939
vessels: 1,213 warships, 4,126 transport vessels (landing ships and landing
craft), and 736 ancillary craft and 864 merchant vessels. Out of the 2,468
major landing vessels in the two task forces deployed on 6 June 1944 only 346
were American. Of the 23 cruisers covering the landings 17 were Royal Navy. In
fact of the 16 warships covering the American Western beaches (Utah and Omaha)
50% were British and Allied ships. There were 195,700 naval personnel involved;
112,824 (58%) were British (Royal Navy), 52,889 (30%) US and 4,988 Allied
countries. The Allied Naval Expeditionary Force was divided into two Naval Task
Forces: Western (Rear-Admiral Alan G Kirk) and Eastern (Rear-Admiral Sir Philip
VianÂ â€“ another veteran of the Italian landings). The warships provided cover
for the transports against any enemy surface warships, submarines or aerial
attack, and supported the landings with shore bombardment. These ships included
the Allied Task Force "O". A small part of the naval operation was Operation
Gambit, when British midget submarines supplied navigation beacons to guide
landing craft. Naval screen. An important part of "Neptune" was the isolation
of the invasion routes and beaches from any intervention by the German
NavyÂ â€“ the Kriegsmarine. The responsibility for this was assigned to the
Royal Navy's Home Fleet. There were two principal perceived German naval
threats. The first was surface attack by German capital ships from anchorages
in Scandinavia and the Baltic Sea. This did not materialise since, by mid-1944,
the battleships were damaged, the cruisers were used for training, and the
Kriegsmarine's fuel allocation had been cut by a third. In any case, the Royal
Navy had strong forces available to repel any attempts, and the Kaiser-Wilhelm-
Kanal area was mined (Operation "Bravado") as a precaution. The second
perceived major threat was that of U-boats transferred from the Atlantic. Air
surveillance from three escort carriers and RAF Coastal Command maintained a
cordon well west of Land's End. Few U-boats were spotted, and most of the
escort groups were moved nearer to the landings. Further efforts were made to
seal the Western Approaches against German naval forces from Brittany and the
Bay of Biscay. Minefields were laid (Operation "Maple") to force enemy ships
away from air protection where they could be attacked by Allied destroyer
flotillas. Again, enemy activity was minor, but on 4 July four German
destroyers were either sunk or forced back to Brest. The Straits of Dover were
closed by minefields, naval and air patrols, radar, and effective bombing raids
on enemy ports. Local German naval forces were small but could be reinforced
from the Baltic. German defenses were concentrated on protecting Pas de Calais
against suspected landings, and no attempt was made to force the blockade. The
screening operation destroyed few German ships, but the objective was achieved.
There were no U-boat or E-boat attacks against Allied shipping on D-Day.
Bombardment. Warships provided supporting fire for the land forces. During
"Neptune", it was given a high importance, using ships from battleships to
destroyers and landing craft. For example, the Canadians at Juno beach had fire
support many times greater than they had had for the Dieppe Raid in 1942. The
old battleships HMS "Ramillies" and "Warspite" and the monitor HMS "Roberts"
were used to suppress shore batteries east of the Orne; cruisers targeted shore
batteries at Ver-sur-Mer and Moulineaux; eleven destroyers for local fire
support. In addition, there were modified landing-craft: eight "Landing Craft
Gun", each with two 4.7-inch guns; four "Landing Craft Support" with automatic
cannon; eight Landing Craft Tank (Rocket), each with a single salvo of 1,100 5-
inch rockets; eight Landing Craft Assault (Hedgerow), each with twenty-four
bombs intended to detonate beach mines prematurely. Twenty-four Landing Craft
Tank carried Priest self-propelled howitzers which also fired while they were
on the run-in to the beach. Similar arrangements existed at other beaches.
Naval losses. The only naval contact during D-Day occurred when four German
torpedo boats reached the Eastern Task Force late in the afternoon and launched
eighteen torpedoes, sinking the Norwegian destroyer HNoMS "Svenner" off Sword
beach but missing the battleships HMS "Warspite" and HMS "Ramillies". After
firing, the German vessels turned away and fled east into a smoke screen.
Thanks to ULTRA, the Allies knew where the Germans' channel was through their
own minefields. The only Allied losses to mines were the USS "Corry" off of
Utah; USS "PC-1261", a 173-foot patrol craft; three LCTs; and two LCIs. The
landings. Air operations. The success of the amphibious landings depended on
the establishment of a secure lodgement from which to expand the beachhead to
allow the build up of a well-supplied force capable of breaking out. The
amphibious forces were especially vulnerable to strong enemy counter-attacks
before the build up of sufficient forces in the beachhead could be
accomplished. To slow or eliminate the enemy's ability to organize and launch
counter-attacks during this critical period, airborne operations were used to
seize key objectives, such as bridges, road crossings, and terrain features,
particularly on the eastern and western flanks of the landing areas. The
airborne landings some distance behind the beaches were also intended to ease
the egress of the amphibious forces off the beaches, and in some cases to
neutralize German coastal defence batteries and more quickly expand the area of
the beachhead. The U.S. 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions were assigned to
objectives west of Utah Beach. The British 6th Airborne Division was assigned
to similar objectives on the eastern flank. 530 Free French paratroopers, from
the British Special Air Service Brigade, were assigned to objectives in
Brittany from 5 June to August. (Operation Dingson, Operation Samwest,
Operation Cooney). The Royal Air Force flew and supplied half of the aircraft
deployed. Nearly half of the US gliders were the larger Airspeed Horsa, as they
carried twice as much as the US equivalent. The RAF created a new command, the
2nd Tactical Air Force flying low level missions especially to support
operations on the ground. British & Canadian airborne landings. The first
Allied action of D-Day was Operation Deadstick, a glider assault at 00:16 on
the bridges over the Caen canal and the River Orne. These were the only
crossings of the river and canal north of Caen around 7Â kilometres (4.5Â mi)
from the coast, near BÃ©nouville and Ranville. For the Germans, the crossing
provided the only route for a flanking attack on the beaches from the east. For
the Allies, the crossing also was vital for any attack on Caen from the east.
The tactical objectives of the British 6th Airborne Division were (a) to
capture intact the bridges of the BÃ©nouville-Ranville crossing, (b) to defend
the crossing against the inevitable armoured counter-attacks, (c) to destroy
German artillery at the Merville battery, which threatened Sword Beach, and (d)
to destroy five bridges over the Dives River to further restrict movement of
ground forces from the east. Airborne troops, mostly paratroopers of the 3rd
and 5th Parachute Brigades, including the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion,
began landing after midnight, 6 June and immediately encountered elements of
the German 716th Infantry Division. At dawn, the Battle Group von Luck of the
21st Panzer Division counterattacked from the south on both sides of the Orne
River. By this time the paratroopers had established a defensive perimeter
surrounding the bridgehead. Casualties were heavy on both sides, but the
airborne troops held. Shortly after noon, they were reinforced by commandos of
the 1st Special Service Brigade. By the end of D-Day, reinforced by Operation
Mallard the 6th Airborne had accomplished all of its objectives. For several
days, both British and German forces took heavy casualties as they struggled
for positions around the Orne bridgehead. For example, the German 346th
Infantry Division broke through the eastern edge of the defensive line on 10
June. Finally, British paratroopers overwhelmed entrenched panzergrenadiers in
the Battle of Breville on 12 June. The Germans did not seriously threaten the
bridgehead again. 6th Airborne remained on the line until it was evacuated in
early September. American airborne landings. The U.S. 82nd and 101st Airborne
Divisions, numbering 13,000 paratroopers delivered by 12 troop carrier groups
of the IX Troop Carrier Command, were less fortunate in completing their main
objectives. To achieve surprise, the drops were routed to approach Normandy
from the west. Numerous factors affected their performance, the primary of
which was the decision to make a massive parachute drop at night (a tactic not
used again for the rest of the war). As a result, 45% of units were widely
scattered and unable to rally. Efforts of the early wave of pathfinder teams to
mark the landing zones were largely ineffective, and the Rebecca/Eureka
transponding radar beacons used to guide in the waves of C-47 Skytrains to the
drop zones were the main component of a flawed system. Three regiments of 101st
Airborne paratroopers were dropped first, between 00:48 and 01:40, followed by
the 82nd Airborne's drops between 01:51 and 02:42. Each operation involved
approximately 400 C-47 aircraft. Two pre-dawn glider landings brought in anti-
tank guns and support troops for each division. On the evening of D-Day two
additional glider landings brought in two battalions of artillery and 24
howitzers to the 82nd Airborne. Additional glider operations on 7 June
delivered the 325th Glider Infantry Regiment to the 82nd Airborne, and two
large supply parachute drops that date were ineffective. After 24 hours, only
2,500 troops of the 101st and 2,000 of the 82nd were under the control of their
divisions, approximating a third of the force dropped. The dispersal of the
American airborne troops, however, had the effect of confusing the Germans and
fragmenting their response. In addition, the Germans' defensive flooding, in
the early stages, also helped to protect the Americans' southern flank.
Paratroopers continued to roam and fight behind enemy lines for days. Many
consolidated into small groups, rallied with NCOs or junior officers, and
usually were a hodgepodge of men from different companies, battalions,
regiments, or even divisions. The 82nd occupied the town of Sainte-MÃ¨re-
Ã‰glise early in the morning of 6 June, giving it the claim of the first town
liberated in the invasion. Sword Beach. The assault on Sword Beach began at
about 03:00 with an aerial bombardment of the German coastal defences and
artillery sites. The naval bombardment began a few hours later. At 07:30, the
first units reached the beach. These were the DD tanks of 13th/18th Hussars
followed closely by the infantry of 8th Brigade. On Sword Beach, the regular
British infantry came ashore with light casualties. They had advanced about 8
kilometres (5Â mi) by the end of the day but failed to take some of the
deliberately ambitious targets set by Montgomery. In particular, Caen, a major
objective, was still in German hands by the end of D-Day, and would remain so
until mid July (central urban area cleared 8â€“9 July, suburbs fully cleared by
20 July in Operation Atlantic), see Battle for Caen. 1st Special Service
Brigade, under the command of Brigadier The Lord Lovat DSO, MC, went ashore in
the second wave led by No.4 Commando with the two French Troops first, as
agreed amongst themselves. The 1st Special Service Brigade's landing is famous
for having been led by Piper Bill Millin. The British and French of No.4
Commando had separate targets in Ouistreham: the French, a blockhouse and the
Casino; the British two German batteries which overlooked the beach. The
blockhouse proved too strong for the Commandos' PIAT (Projector Infantry Anti
Tank) weapons, but the Casino was taken with the aid of a Centaur tank. The
British Commandos achieved both battery objectives only to find the gun mounts
empty and the guns removed. Leaving the mopping-up procedure to the infantry,
the Commandos withdrew from Ouistreham to join the other units of their brigade
(Nos.3, 6 and 45), moving inland to join-up with the 6th Airborne Division.
Juno Beach. The Canadian forces that landed on Juno Beach faced 2 heavy
batteries of 155Â mm guns and 9 medium batteries of 75Â mm guns, as well as
machine-gun nests, pillboxes, other concrete fortifications, and a seawall
twice the height of the one at Omaha Beach. The first wave suffered 50%
casualties, the second highest of the five D-Day beachheads. The use of armour
was successful at Juno, in some instances actually landing ahead of the
infantry as intended and helping clear a path inland. Despite the obstacles,
the Canadians were off the beach within hours and beginning their advance
inland. A single troop of four tanks managed to reach the final objective phase
line, but hastily retreated, having outrun its infantry support. In particular,
two fortified positions at the Douvres Radar Station remained in German hands
(and would for several days until captured by British commandos), and no link
had been established with Sword Beach. By the end of D-Day, 30,000 Canadians
had been successfully landed, and the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division had
penetrated further into France than any other Allied force, despite having
faced strong resistance at the water's edge and later counterattacks on the
beachhead by elements of the German 21st and 12th SS "Hitlerjugend" (Hitler
Youth) Panzer divisions on 7 and 8 June. Gold Beach. At Gold Beach, 25,000 men
were landed, under the command of Lieutenant-General Miles Dempsey, Commander
of the British 2nd Army. The casualties were also quite heavy, around 400,
partly because bad weather delayed the swimming Sherman DD tanks, and also
because the Germans had strongly fortified a village on the beach. However, the
50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division overcame these difficulties and advanced
almost to the outskirts of Bayeux by the end of the day. With the exception of
the Canadians at Juno Beach, no division came closer to its objectives than the
50th. No.47 (RM) Commando was the last British Commando unit to land and came
ashore on "Gold" east of La Hamel. Their task was to proceed inland then turn
right (west) and make a 16-kilometre (10Â mi) march through enemy territory to
attack the coastal harbour of Port en Bessin from the rear. This small port, on
the British extreme right, was well sheltered in the chalk cliffs and
significant in that it was to be a prime early harbour for supplies to be
brought in, including fuel by underwater pipe from tankers moored offshore.
Omaha Beach. Elements of the 1st Infantry Division and 29th Infantry Division
(US) faced the recently formed German 352nd Infantry Division, a mixed group of
Russian "volunteers" and teenagers stiffened with a cadre of east front
veterans, unusual in the fact that it was one of the few German divisions
remaining with a full complement of three regiments albeit at reduced strength;
fifty percent of its officers had no combat experience. However, Allied
intelligence was unaware until two weeks before the planned invasion that the
100Â km stretch of beach originally allocated to be defended by the 716th
Infantry Division (static) had been cut into two parts in March, with the 716th
moving to the "Caen Zone", and the 352nd taking over the "Bayeux Zone", thus
doubling the complement of defenders. Omaha was also the most heavily fortified
beach, with high bluffs defended by funneled mortars, machine guns, and
artillery, and the pre-landing aerial and naval bombardment of the bunkers
proved to be ineffective. Difficulties in navigation caused the majority of
landings to drift eastwards, missing their assigned sectors and the initial
assault waves of tanks, infantry and engineers took heavy casualties. Of the 16
tanks that landed upon the shores of Omaha Beach only 2 survived the landing.
The official record stated that "within 10 minutes of the ramps being lowered,
leading company had become inert, leaderless and almost incapable of action.
Every officer and sergeant had been killed or wounded [...] It had become a
struggle for survival and rescue". Only a few gaps were blown in the beach
obstacles, resulting in problems for subsequent landings. The heavily defended
draws, the only vehicular routes off the beach, could not be taken and two
hours after the first assault the beach was closed for all but infantry
landings. Commanders (including General Omar Bradley) considered abandoning the
beachhead, but small units of infantry, often forming ad hoc groups, supported
by naval artillery and the surviving tanks, eventually infiltrated the coastal
defences by scaling the bluffs between strongpoints. Further infantry landings
were able to exploit the initial penetrations and by the end of the day two
isolated footholds had been established. American casualties at Omaha on D-Day
numbered around 5,000 out of 50,000 men, most in the first few hours, while the
Germans suffered 1,200 killed, wounded or missing. The tenuous beachhead was
expanded over the following days, and the original D-Day objectives were
accomplished by D+3. Pointe du Hoc. The massive concrete cliff-top gun
emplacement at Pointe du Hoc was the target of the 2nd Ranger Battalion,
commanded by James Earl Rudder. The task was to scale the 30 meter (100Â ft)
cliffs under the cover of night, approximately at 5:30, one hour prior to the
landings with ropes and ladders, and then attack and destroy the German "15,5
cm Kanone 418(f)" coastal defence guns, which were thought to command the Omaha
and Utah landing areas. The infantry commanders did not know that the guns had
been moved prior to the attack, and they had to press farther inland to find
them and eventually destroyed them. However, fortifications themselves were
still vital targets as a single artillery forward observer based there could
have called down accurate fire on the U.S. beaches. The Rangers were eventually
successful, and captured the fortifications. They then had to fight for two
days to hold the location, losing more than 60% of their men. Afterwards they
regrouped and continued Northeast to the rally point one mile from the gun
emplacements on Pointe Du Hoc. Utah Beach. Casualties on Utah Beach, the
westernmost landing zone, were the lightest of any beach, with 197 out of the
roughly 23,000 troops that landed. The 4th Infantry Division troops landing at
Utah Beach found themselves in the wrong positions because of a current that
pushed their landing craft to the southeast. Instead of landing at Tare Green
and Uncle Red sectors, they came ashore at Victor sector, relatively little
German opposition was encountered. The 4th Infantry Division was able to press
inland relatively easily over beach exits that had been seized from the inland
side by the 502nd and 506th Parachute Infantry Regiments of the 101st Airborne
Division. This was partially by accident, because their planned landing was
further down the beach (Brig. Gen. Theodore Roosevelt Jr, the Asst. Commander
of 4th Division, upon discovering the landings were off course, was famous for
stating "We will start the war from right here."). By early afternoon, the 4th
Infantry Division had succeeded in linking up with elements of the 101st.
American casualties were light, and the troops were able to press inward much
faster than expected, making it a near-complete success. The Crossword Panic of
1944. Leonard Dawe, the headmaster at Strand school in Effingham, Surrey often
compiled crossword puzzles for various newspapers. In August 1942 a crossword
compiled by Dawe appeared in the Daily Telegraph gave a clue as "French port"
six letters, the answer was Dieppe, and two days later the disastrous Dieppe
Raid took place. It was suspected by the War Office that the crossword had been
used to pass information to the enemy and called in Lord Tweedsmuir to
investigate. The inquiry, which also included MI5 concluded that it was just a
remarkable coincidence that the word had appeared so soon before the raid.
During the run up to the Normandy landings, five of the codenames that were
being used were answers in crosswords that he had submitted to the Telegraph.
In his crossword for 2 May the clue for 17 across was "one of the U.S.."-the
correct answer was Utah. On May 22 the clue for 3 down, " Red indian on the
Missouri" gave the answer Omaha. On 27 May, "overlord" was the answer to 11
across, again, three days later on 30 May the answer for 11 across was
"Mulberry" - giving a total of four top-secret codewords being given as answers
in less than a month. The final straw came on the 1st June when "Neptune" was
the answer for 15 across. In previous months, answers for clues were Gold, Juno
and Sword. Dawes was tracked down and arrested by MI5 and following
interrogation he was able to persuade them that it was all just a coincidence
and that he had actually compiled the puzzles months earlier. It is not really
known if it was a coincidence or if Dawes got the words after hearing them from
his Brother-in-Law who worked at the Admiralty. War memorials and tourism. The
beaches at Normandy are still referred to on maps and signposts by their
invasion codenames. There are also several vast cemeteries in the area. The
American cemetery, in Colleville-sur-Mer, contains rows of identical white
crosses and Stars of David commemorating the American dead. Commonwealth
graves, in many locations, use white headstones engraved with the person's
religious symbol and their unit insignia. The largest cemetery in Normandy is
the La Cambe German war cemetery, which features granite stones almost flush
with the ground and groups of low-set crosses. There is also a Polish cemetery.
The Commonwealth War Graves Commission are responsible for the upkeep of the
cemetery's. Streets near the beaches are named after the units that fought
there, and occasional markers commemorate notable incidents. At significant
points, such as Pointe du Hoc and Pegasus Bridge, there are plaques, memorials
or small museums. Sections of the Mulberry harbour still sit in the sea at
Arromanches. In Sainte-MÃ¨re-Ã‰glise, a dummy paratrooper hangs from the church
spire. On Juno Beach, the Canadian government has built the Juno Beach
Information Centre, commemorating one of the most significant events in
Canadian military history. In Caen is a large Museum for Peace, which is
dedicated to peace generally, rather than only to the battle.
