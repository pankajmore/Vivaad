CoandÄƒ-1910 The CoandÄƒ-1910, designed by Romanian inventor Henri CoandÄƒ, was
the first full-size attempt at a jet aircraft. Built as a sesquiplane, it
featured an experimental aircraft engine which CoandÄƒ called the "turbo-
propulseur," a centrifugal compressor propulsion system with a multi-bladed
rotary fan situated in a duct and driven by a conventional piston engine. The
unusual aircraft attracted attention at the Second International Aeronautical
Exhibition in Paris in October 1910, being the only exhibit without a
propeller, but the aircraft was not displayed afterward and it fell from public
awareness. CoandÄƒ used a similar turbo-propulseur to drive a snow sled, but he
did not develop it further for aircraft. Decades later, after the practical
demonstration of motorjets and turbojets, CoandÄƒ began to tell various
conflicting stories about how his early experiments were precursors to the jet,
even that his turbo-propulseur was the first motorjet engine complete with fuel
combustion in the air stream. He also said that he had made a single brief
flight in December 1910, crashing just after take-off, the aircraft destroyed
by fire. Two aviation historians countered CoandÄƒ's version of events, saying
there was no proof that the engine had combustion in the air stream, and no
proof that the aircraft ever flew. In 1965, CoandÄƒ brought drawings forward to
prove his claim of combustion ducting but these were shown to be recently
reworked, differing substantially from the originals. Many aviation historians
were dismissive, saying that CoandÄƒ's turbo-propulseur design involved a weak
stream of "plain air", not a powerful jet of air expanding from fuel
combustion. In 2010, based on the notion that CoandÄƒ invented the first jet,
the centennial of the jet aircraft was celebrated in Romania. A special coin
and stamp were issued, and construction began on a working replica of the
aircraft. At the European Parliament, an exhibition commemorated the building
and testing of the CoandÄƒ-1910. Early developments. CoandÄƒ was interested in
achieving reactive propelled flight as early as 1905, conducting tests of
rockets attached to model aircraft, the tests held in Bucharest at the Romanian
Army arsenal. In secret, at Spandau in Germany, CoandÄƒ successfully tested a
flying machine equipped with a single tractor propeller, and two counter-
rotating propellers providing lift, powered by a 50-horsepower (37Â kW)
Antoinette engine. Positioned along the fuselage centreline, the smaller rear
lift propeller was mounted vertically, while the larger front one was inclined
slightly forwards at 17Â degrees to the vertical. According to later claims,
CoandÄƒ tested the aircraft at Cassel, witnessed by the Chancellor of the
German Empire Bernhard von BÃ¼low. It was around this time that CoandÄƒ's
interest in jet propulsion began, and according to him the aircraft and a jet-
propelled model were displayed in December 1907 at the "Sporthalle" (indoor
sports arena) in Berlin. CoandÄƒ continued his studies at Liege, Belgium, where
together with his room-mate and friend Giovanni Battista Caproni, he built the
CoandÄƒ-Caproni box glider, based on the plans of gliders designed by Otto
Lilienthal and Octave Chanute which he previously studied at Charlottenburg and
Spandau. In 1909 he was employed as technical director of the LiÃ¨ge-Spa
Aeroclub, and at the end of that year, with the help of car manufacturer
Joachim he built the CoandÄƒ-Joachim glider. Caproni was present when the
glider was flown at Spa-Malchamps, Belgium. 1910s. With the opening of the
"Ã‰cole supÃ©rieure d'aÃ©ronautique et de constructions mÃ©caniques" on 15
November 1909, CoandÄƒ moved to Paris. As a continuation of his Belgian
experiments, and especially looking for a way to test wing airfoils at higher
speeds, he contacted Ernest Archdeacon, the co-founder of "L'Aero-Club de
France", who in turn directed CoandÄƒ to Gustav Eiffel and Paul PainlevÃ©. With
their assistance, he gained approval to test different wing configurations and
air resistance on a platform built by Eiffel at the front of a locomotive on
the North of France railway. In March, he started flying lessons at Reims in a
RenÃ© Hanriot monoplane. In an "atelier" (work room) in the courtyard of his
house, he started to build his slender sesquiplane and the unusual powerplant,
helped by his schoolfriend Cammarotta-Adorno. There, he tested the thrust of
the powerplant on a dynamometer, tests which are described in detail in the
April 1910 edition of "La Technique AÃ©ronautique" magazine. He filed for
several patents for the mechanism and aircraft on 30 May 1910, with later
additions to the existing patents. CoandÄƒ exhibited the aircraft 15 October
â€“ 2 November 1910 at the Second International Aeronautical Exhibition, an
annual event commonly referred to in aviation magazines as the Paris salon, or
Paris flight salon. Together with Henri Fabre's "Hydravion", the first
floatplane, CoandÄƒ's aircraft and devices used for aerodynamic experiments
were placed "in solitary state" in an upstairs gallery, separated from the more
usual types of aircraft on the main exhibit floor. The aircraft construction
was a novelty for the time. In contrast to the monoplane described in the July
1910 patent application, the exhibit was a sesquiplane, which complicated the
construction, but in return solved lateral stability control issues. The
cantilevered wings were held in place at three points by tubular steel struts
without any bracing from flying wires. According to CoandÄƒ's description the
wings were built with metal spars, but existing photographs of the construction
show a completely wooden internal structure. The trailing edges of the upper
wing could be twisted separately or together for lateral control or braking
during landing, and were controlled by pedals in the two-seat open cockpit. The
fuselage, painted reddish-brown and highly polished, was described by "The
Technical World" magazine as having a framework of steel; though the
construction photographs indicate that it had a wooden framework. This was
triangular in cross-section with convex ribs, strengthened with a covering of
heat-shaped moulded plywood and having strips of steel placed over the ribs.
Tubular radiators for engine cooling were located on either side of the
cockpit. The vertical struts from the wings were secured to the fuselage with
steel collars fixed with screws. The fuselage terminated in a cruciform
empennage with control surfaces at 45Â° angles to vertical and horizontal. Four
triangular surfaces at the rear of the tail were controlled using a pair of
large Antoinette VII-style steering wheels mounted outside of the cockpit, one
on each side, and were used for pitch and direction control. It was an early
instance of what are now known as ruddervators. Forward of the tail was a small
horizontal stabiliser. The fuel tank was located in the fuselage between the
engine and the cockpit. A remarkable feature of the aircraft was its
powerplant. Instead of a propeller, a 50Â hp (37Â kW) in-line water-cooled
reciprocating internal combustion engine built by Pierre Clerget at a ClÃ©ment-
Bayard workshop with funding from "L'Aero-Club de France", placed in the
forward section of the fuselage, drove a rotary compressor through a 1:
4 gearbox (1,000Â rpm on the Clerget turned the compressor at 4,000Â rpm) which
drew air in from the front and expelled it rearward under compression and with
added heat. The compressor, with a diameter of 50Â centimetres (20Â in), was
located within a cowling at the front of the fuselage. According to later
CoandÄƒ descriptions, cast aluminium components were also made by Clerget to
create a powerplant with a weight of 2.8Â pounds (1.3Â kg) per horsepower
(equivalent to a power-to-weight ratio of 0.36Â hp/lb), a considerable
achievement at the time. CoandÄƒ's 1910s-era patents describe the inline piston
engine's exhaust gases as being routed through heating channels or heat
exchangers in contact with the central air flow, then sucked into the
compressor inlet to reduce back-pressure on the engine while adding more heat
and mass to the air flow. The turbo-propulseur was claimed to be capable of
generating 220Â Kilogram-force (2,157Â N; 485Â lbf) of thrust. The powerplant
was referred to in reports at the time by different terms: a turbine without
propellers, turbo-propulseur, ducted fan or a suction turbine. Aviation
reporters from "The Aero" and "La Technique Aeronautique" were doubtful that
the powerplant could provide sufficient thrust. The engine was noted in "The
Aero", reprinted in "Aircraft", as being "of remarkably small proportions in
relation to the size of the machine." The writer said the turbo-propulseur was
"claimed to give an enormous wind velocity", but the intake area seemed too
small to produce the stated thrust, and that "it also appears as if enormous
power would be necessary to drive it", more than supplied by the Clerget. The
CoandÄƒ-1910 was reportedly sold to Charles Weymann in October 1910. A daily
newspaper from Bucharest wrote in 1910 that the aircraft was constructed in
Clerget's workshops and that it "will fly in 6â€“7 weeks near Paris, piloted by
Weymann, one of the pilots celebrated at the Rennes aviation meeting." Another
Bucharest newspaper listed the aircraft in November as "sold twice-over". It
may be that Weymann expressed his willingness to buy the aircraft once tests
had been carried out. At the exhibition, reaction among observers was mixed.
Some doubted the aircraft would fly, and focused on more likely machines such
as the Sloan, the Voisin, or the Louis Paulhan construction of a Henri Fabre
machine. Others gave special notice to the CoandÄƒ-1910, calling it original
and ingenious. The reporter from "La Technique Aeronautique" wrote, "In the
absence of definitive trials, permitting the precise yield of this machine, it
is without doubt premature to say it will supersede the propellerÂ ... the
tentative is interesting and we watch it closely." The official exhibition
report ignored the turbo-propulseur engine and instead described CoandÄƒ's
novel wing design, and the unusual empennage. On 15 November 1910,
"L'AÃ©rophile" wrote that if the machine were ever to develop as the inventor
hoped, it would be "a beautiful dream". After the exhibition the aircraft was
moved to a ClÃ©ment-Bayard workshop at Issy-les-Moulineaux for further testing.
This work is reflected by additions to the powerplant-related patents of 3
December. A group of modern-day Romanian investigators led by Dan Antoniu,
having examined photographs from 1910, concluded that the rotary compressor
featured at the exhibition was a hybrid between the one described in the
initial 30 May 1910 patent and the one shown in a later patent application.
They felt that the exhibition machine had a simpler director system, a
different rotor with a smaller intake cone, and that the exhaust gas heat
transfer system had not been implemented. According to GÃ©rard Hartmann in his
"Dossiers historiques et techniques aÃ©ronautique franÃ§aise", the propulsion
system generated only 17Â kg of thrust, and to generate enough thrust for the
aircraft to take off (estimated by CoandÄƒ at 24Â kg) CoandÄƒ would have had to
spin the "turbine" (the rotary compressor) at a speed of 7,000Â rpm with the
risk of it exploding. This was not tried, but Hartmann concluded that the
experiment proved that the solution worked perfectly. Henri Mirguet writing for
"L'AÃ©rophile" magazine in January 1912, recalled the previous exhibition's
machine as the "chief attraction" of the 1910 salon. He wrote that CoandÄƒ
answered his "pressingâ€”and indiscreetâ€”questions" about the turbo-
propulseur-powered aircraft at that earlier exhibit, telling him that the
machine had attained a speed of 112Â kilometres per hour (70Â mph) during
several "flight tests", an improbable answer about which Mirguet "reserved
judgment", waiting for confirmation that never materialised. Related
developments. The additional turbo-propulseur patent application 13.502, dated
3 December 1910, was implemented on a double-seat motorised sled commissioned
by Cyril Vladimirovich, Grand Duke of Russia. With the help of Despujols, a
boat maker, and the motor manufacturer Gregoire, CoandÄƒ supervised the
building of a motor sled, powered by a 30Â hp (22Â kW) Gregoire engine driving
the turbo-propulseur. The sled was blessed by Russian Orthodox priests at the
Despujols plant near Paris on 2 December 1910. Starting the next day, it was
exhibited for two weeks at the 12th Automobile Salon of France, alongside
Gregoire-powered automobiles on the Gregoire stand. A number of automobile and
general interest magazines published photographs or sketches of the sled. This
was the second time in the autumn of 1910 that a version of CoandÄƒ's turbo-
propulseur design was shown at the Grand Palais of Paris. One of the
periodicals reported an expected speed of , but no account exists of the sled
being tested. CoandÄƒ continued to work on the CoandÄƒ-1910 project at the
beginning of 1911, aiming to improve stability, increase the power of the
turbo-propulseur, and to implement airfoil improvements. CoandÄƒ applied for
new patents for aerodynamic investigations and improvements of the CoandÄƒ-
1910. CoandÄƒ described a different, more sturdy system for the attachment of
the wings, which also enabled changes in the angle of attack and the centre of
gravity. He aimed to obtain more power from the propulsion system, and design
drawings show the arrangement of two air-cooled rotary engines on the sides of
the fuselage. The placement of the engines indicates that CoandÄƒ did not
intend to inject fuel into the jet stream and ignite it, as the cooling of the
engines would have been compromised. The patent was annotated with an
additional claim on 19 July 1911 which brought significant changes, for
instance retractable landing gear with dampers inside aerodynamic fairings with
skids. The horizontal stabiliser was removed, a supporting surface was provided
for each engine, and their accessories were covered to improve aerodynamics.
Though CoandÄƒ continued to study rotary propulsion mechanisms, Antoniu
believes that CoandÄƒ never implemented a practical solution because of the
lack of funds. In May 1911 CoandÄƒ filed English-language patents on the turbo-
propulseur design in the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as a
second French-language patent filed in Switzerland,US Patent 1104963
"Propeller". Filing date: 29 May 1911. Issue date: July 1914.Swiss patent
CH58232(A), filed 26 May 1911, published 1 March 1913. and he described it for
the 1911 publication of "L'Annuaire de l'Air". The very expensive project of
1910, costing CoandÄƒ about one million francs, left him with limited funds.
The possibility of a new contract with the French government lead CoandÄƒ to
build the CoandÄƒ-1911. He wished to win an army-organised competition at Reims
in October, one that required two engines in each aircraft as a fail-safe
strategy. At the third aviation salon in Paris 1911, CoandÄƒ displayed a scale
model of the aircraft which used two Gnome rotary engines mounted back to back,
connected by a bevel gear to one propeller. The strange combination of two
engines connected to one propeller was intended to drive a new turbine, but
CoandÄƒ was unable to fund one and was forced to use a two-bladed propeller.
During trials the assembly did not provide enough traction and a four-bladed
propeller was ordered. The mounting support of the engines, initially intended
for a jet propulsion version was not adequate for the new configuration, so the
forward chassis had to be modified. Henri Mirguet writing for "L'AÃ©rophile"
magazine in January 1912 said that the new 1911 aircraft retained the fuselage,
the frame and the wing of CoandÄƒ's 1910 design, but did not keep the turbo-
propulseur or "the wooden wingloading surface including the forward
longitudinal ribs". The aircraft was flown on 21 October 1911, but with modest
results as the latest modifications, especially those related to the
powerplant, did not compensate for the increased total weight of the aircraft.
At the military contest, it did not meet the requirements for independent
operation of each engine. Following the 1911 exhibition, at the personal
request of Sir George White, CoandÄƒ moved to the United Kingdom to take a
position as chief engineer or chief designer at British and Colonial Aeroplane
Company for a few years. In the next four decades, CoandÄƒ worked on a great
variety of inventions. During World War II he revived his earlier turbo-
propulseur engine: he was contracted by the German Army in late 1942 to develop
an air propulsion system for military ambulance snow sleds much like the one
made for the Russian Grand Duke. The German contract concluded after one year,
yielding no plans for production. Though CoandÄƒ had experimented with a
variety of nozzles, and said that he had achieved a degree of success, no
turbojet-engine-style fuel injection or combustion in the air stream was
attempted. CoandÄƒ and his 1910 aircraft were absent from much of aviation
literature of the day. None of the annual issues of "Jane's All the World's
Aircraft" ever mentioned the CoandÄƒ-1910 or its turbo-propulseur powerplant.
As well, the Soviet engineer Nikolai Rynin did not mention CoandÄƒ at all in
his exhaustive nine-volume encyclopedia on jet and rocket engines, written in
the late 1920s and early '30s. Later claims. At the beginning of the jet age,
when the potential of reactive engines was recognised, a number of histories of
the jet engine were written. A once-classified Guggenheim Aeronautical
Laboratory and Jet Propulsion Laboratory study completed in 1946 described the
CoandÄƒ-1910 as "probably not flown" but featuring "a mechanical jet propulsion
device with a centrifugal blower", one in which heat from the Clerget piston
engine "furnished auxiliary jet propulsion." In the editorial lead to their
1946 article on CoandÄƒ's "Augmented Flow", "Flight" terms it, "scarcely a
jet". In the same year Geoffrey G. Smith chronicled technological development
in his book "Gas Turbines and Jet Propulsion for Aircraft", but did not mention
CoandÄƒ. In 1950's "l'aviation d'Ader et des temps hÃ©roiques", the authors
assert that CoandÄƒ flew the first jet aircraft at Issy-les-moulineaux for
30Â metres (100Â ft), ending with a crash. In 1953, "Flight"s treatment of
aircraft in the 50 years since the Wright brothers' flight included the
CoandÄƒ-1910 "ducted fan" and said of Coanda that he "believes that he 'took
off for a few feet, then came down hurriedly and broke two teeth, quoting J.W.
Adderley's 1952 letter to the editor of "Flight", after Adderley's discussion
with CoandÄƒ in Paris at the end of World War II. Adderley said he "can
definitely confirm that the power unit was of the ducted-fan type, similar in
basic principles to the Caproni-Campini aircraft of the 1930s" (referring to
the Caproni Campini N.1. In the early 1950s, CoandÄƒ began to say that he had
flown his 1910 aircraft himself, and that the 1910 powerplant was the first
motorjet, using fuel injection and combustion to create its thrust. In 1955 and
1956, a number of aviation articles presented the CoandÄƒ version of 1910
events. He said he took off and crashed in December 1910 in the presence of
aircraft makers Louis Charles Breguet and Gabriel Voisin. CoandÄƒ himself spoke
on the subject, notably before the Wings Club at New York's Biltmore Hotel on
18 January 1956 where he said "I intended to inject fuel into the air stream
which would be ignited by the exhaust gases also channeled through the same
circular vent", implying that he never finished the powerplant. Martin Caidin
wrote "The Coanda Story" for the May 1956 issue of "Flying", based on a
personal interview. For his article "He Flew In 1910", RenÃ© Aubrey interviewed
CoandÄƒ and wrote a contradictory story in the September 1956 "Royal Air Force
Flying Review", saying that CoandÄƒ had flown his unusual aircraft on 16
December 1910, that fuel was certainly injected, and that it was "the first jet
flight in the world". In Aubrey's relation of the interview, the aircraft
stalled after take-off, throwing CoandÄƒ clear, and "gently collapsed to the
ground" where it burned. Aubrey wrote that the aircraft engine was "designed by
a friend to CoandÄƒ's specification", and that its burning exhaust was
"directed below and to each side of the fuselage, which was protected by
asbestos in vulnerable places." A collection of aviation stories was published
in 1957 by Major Victor Houart, a friend of CoandÄƒ's, who wrote that he was an
eyewitness the day CoandÄƒ flew and crashed. One chapter of the book describes
how Houart, together with a group of French dragoons, watched as CoandÄƒ taxied
twice around the airfield, lifted off to avoid the ruins of an old
fortification wall, started flames from the engine by applying too much power,
and was thrown from the aircraft the moment it hit the wall, with CoandÄƒ "not
badly hurt". Houart's version put the fuel tank in the overhead wing, which was
metal. In further statements, CoandÄƒ said that his 1910 aircraft had movable
leading edge slots, retractable landing gear and a fuel supply which was held
in the overhead wing to reduce fuselage profile and thus drag. In 1965, CoandÄƒ
presented a set of drawings, photographs and specifications of the 1910
aircraft to the National Air and Space Museum (NASM), prepared by Huyck
Corporation and received by Director S. Paul Johnston and early aviation
curator Louis Casey. Rocket engineer G. Harry Stine worked alongside CoandÄƒ
from 1961 to 1965 at Huyck Corporation, and interviewed him in 1962. In 1967,
the magazine "Flying" printed an account written by Stine, which described the
landing gear as retracting into the lower wing, with the fuel tank hidden in
the upper wing. Stine wrote that CoandÄƒ flew on 10 December 1910, and
described the heat from the "two jet exhausts" as being "too much for me" after
the powerplant was mounted in the aircraft. In the 1980s after CoandÄƒ's death,
Stine wrote a magazine article and a book mentioning the 1910 aircraft,
including new details such as the name of master mechanic Pierre Clerget as the
friend who helped build the turbo-propulseur. Stine's recounting of the 10
December flight included the group of eyewitness French dragoons, asbestos heat
shields and metal deflector plates aft of the engine, intended taxiing with
unintentional flight, a steep climb with a stall, CoandÄƒ thrown clear, and the
aircraft crashing to the ground, burning. Stine gave his assessment that
"Coanda's turbopropulseur had elements of a true jet", but that the patent
application had no indication of the "critical stageâ€”injection of fuel into
the compressed air". He wrote that "although there were several jet-propelled
aircraft in existence at an early timeâ€”the 1910 Coanda Jet and the 1938
Caproni Campini N.1â€”the first pure jet aircraft flight was made in Germany in
1938". In 1965, Historian Emeritus Paul E. Garber of the NASM interviewed
CoandÄƒ, who related that the December 1910 flight was no accident, that he had
seated himself in the cockpit intending to test five factors: aircraft
structure, the engine, the wing lift, the balance of controls, and the
aerodynamics. He said that the heat from the engine was "fantastic", but that
he placed mica sheets and deflecting plates to direct the jet blast away from
the wooden fuselage. Garber wrote that as CoandÄƒ's aircraft began to move
forward and rise from the ground, "the exhaust flame, instead of fanning
outward, curved inward and ignited the aircraft." In this interview, CoandÄƒ
said that he brought the aircraft back to earth under control, but the landing
was "abrupt" and he was thrown clear of the airframe which was consumed
completely by flame, the engine reduced to "a few handfuls of white powder."
Rebuttals. In 1960, Charles Harvard Gibbs-Smith, aviation historian at the
Science Museum in London, reacted to the mid-1950s assertion that CoandÄƒ built
and flew the first jet engine aircraft. Gibbs-Smith wrote that "there has
recently arisen some controversy about this machine, designed by the Rumanian-
born and French-domiciled Henri Coanda, which was exhibited at the Paris salon
in October 1910. Until recently it has been accepted as an all-wood
sesquiplane, with cantilever wings, powered by a 50Â hp Clerget engine driving
a 'turbo-propulseur' in the form of a large but simple ducted air fan. This fan
was fitted right across the machine's nose and the cowling covered the nose and
part of the engine: the resulting 'jet' of plain air was to propel the
aeroplane." He wrote that "no claims that it flew, or was even tested, were
made at the time", and that the story of it flying suddenly appeared in the
1950sâ€”the aircraft was thus "disinterred from its obscurity." He wrote that
the airfield at Issy-les-Moulineaux, a former military exercise ground where
the test supposedly took place, was under the constant observation of the
French Army who owned it, and under observation by French aviation reporters
and photographers, and by aviation experts from other countries. He said that
the airfield was the "most famous, most used, most observed, and most reported-
on 'airfield' in Paris", and that all events, let alone an exciting crash and
destruction by fire, would have been carried in local papers, and described in
military reports, but no contemporary accounts exist of the CoandÄƒ-1910 being
tested, flown or destroyed. Gibbs-Smith countered the CoandÄƒ assertions point
by point, saying that the aircraft did not have a retractable undercarriage,
did not have leading or trailing edge wing slots, did not have a fuel tank
overhead in the wing, and did not have fuel injected into any turbine. Gibbs-
Smith pointed out that the pilot would have been killed by the heat if any
combustion had been initiated in the engine's air stream. In 2010, Antoniu
wrote that he thought Gibbs-Smith speculated on the basis of the evidence of
absence that the aircraft was never tested or flown, but that Gibbs-Smith did
not find any concrete evidence to support his position. Similarly, Antoniu was
unable to find concrete proof of a test flight. Antoniu also wrote that Gibbs-
Smith did not check the French patents claimed by CoandÄƒ in 1910 and 1911,
describing the retractable gear, leading edge wing slot and upper wing fuel
tank, and that he did not see photographs from private collections
demonstrating aspects about which he wrote. In 1980, NASM historian Frank H.
Winter examined the 1965 drawings and specifications CoandÄƒ prepared while at
Huyck Corporation, and wrote an article about CoandÄƒ's claim: "There is a
wholly new description of the inner workings of the machine that does not occur
in any of the accounts given the 1910s and which defies all of the patent
specifications." He said CoandÄƒ told various conflicting stories about his
claimed 1910 flight, and that CoandÄƒ produced a set of altered drawings as
proof of his claims: In his article, Winter wondered why CoandÄƒ did not add
the novel feature of fuel injection and air stream combustion to his May 1911
patent applications if that feature had been present during his supposed flying
experience five months earlier. Rather, Winter noted that the August 1910
patent filings in French were essentially the same as the May 1911 ones in
English, and that all the descriptions were applicable to air "or water"
flowing through the device, meaning that the patents could not possibly include
fuel combustion in the jet stream. He also noted that no mention was made in
the early patents of asbestos or mica heat shields, or of any fuel injection or
combustion. While looking through aviation periodicals and Paris newspapers
reporting for the month of December, 1910, Winter found that there was a spell
of bad weather at Issy during which no flying took place. This situation
occurred mid-month, the period covering the conflicting dates (10 and 16
December) that CoandÄƒ said his aircraft was tested, flown and crashed. In
their regular "Foreign Aviation News" column, "Flight" magazine reported that
the "blank period" of inclement weather at Issy ended on the 19th when
Guillaume Busson tested a monoplane made by Armand Deperdussin. Other aircraft
tests and piloting activities were listed, with no mention of CoandÄƒ or his
machine. Winter found that Camille (or Cosimo) Canovetti, an Italian civil and
aviation engineer, had been working on a turbo-propulseur-style aviation engine
before CoandÄƒ, and had attempted to show an aircraft with such an engine at
the Aviation Exposition in Milan in 1909. Canovetti took out patents on his
machine in 1909, and more in 1910. Canovetti wrote in 1911 that the 1910
appearance of the CoandÄƒ engine "called general attention" to designs like
his. After CoandÄƒ's death. Modern reference books about aviation history
represent the CoandÄƒ-1910 in various ways, if they mention the machine or the
inventor at all. Some acknowledge CoandÄƒ as the discoverer of the CoandÄƒ
effect but give Hans von Ohain the honour of designing the first jet engine to
power an aircraft in manned flight, and Frank Whittle the honour of completing
and patenting the first jet engine capable of such flight. In their 1994 book
"American Aviation", authors Joe Christy and LeRoy Cook state that CoandÄƒ's
1910 aircraft was the first jet. Aviation author Bill Gunston changed his mind
two years after publishing a 1993 book in which he gave CoandÄƒ credit for the
first jet engine. Gunston's 1995 description began: "Romanian Henri Coanda
built a biplane with a Clerget inline piston engine which, instead of turning a
propeller, drove a centrifugal compressor blowing air to the rear. The thrust
was said to be 220Â kilograms [490Â lb], a figure the author disbelieves. On 10
December 1910 the aircraft thus powered inadvertently became airborne, crashed
and burned. Often called 'a turbine aeroplane', this was of no more
significance than the Campini aircraft mentioned later, and Coanda wisely
decided to switch to a propeller." In his publication of 1998â€”"World
Encyclopedia of Aero Engines: All major aircraft power plants, from the Wright
brothers to the present day"â€”Gunston did not include Coanda; nor did he
include Coanda in 2005's "Jane's Aero-Engines" or 2006's "World Encyclopedia of
Aero Engines". Walter J. Boyne, director of the National Air and Space Museum
and a prolific aviation author, mentions CoandÄƒ in passing a few times in his
works. Boyne discusses CoandÄƒ briefly in one of his books, "The Leading Edge":
"Professor Henri Coanda, whose scientific work was impeccable, designed and
built a jet aircraft in 1910; it, like Martin's Kitten Martin KF-1 biplane, was
superbly built and technically advancedâ€”and could not fly." In a later
magazine article sidebar, Boyne described more details: "Romanian inventor
Henri Coanda attempted to fly a primitive jet aircraft in 1910, using a four-
cylinder internal combustion engine to drive a compressor at 4,000 revolutions
per minute. It was equipped with what today might be called an afterburner,
producing an estimated 500Â pounds [230Â kg] of thrust. Countless loyal Coanda
fans insist that the airplane flew. Others say it merely crashed." In 1980 and
1993, "Jane's Encyclopedia of Aviation" included an entry on the 1910 aircraft,
calling it the "Coanda turbine" and describing it as "the world's first jet-
propelled aircraft to fly". In 2003, Winter co-authored a book with fellow NASM
curator F. Robert van der Linden: "100 Years of Flight: A Chronicle of
Aerospace History, 1903â€“2003". In the book the CoandÄƒ-1910 is described as
an unsuccessful ducted fan aircraft lacking documentation to substantiate any
flight test. Citing Carl A. Brown's 1985 "A History of Aviation", Tim Brady,
the Dean of Aviation at Embryâ€“Riddle Aeronautical University, wrote in 2000:
"the development of the jet is, broadly, the story of three men: Henri Coanda,
Sir Frank Whittle, and Pabst von Ohain..." His description of CoandÄƒ's
disputed test flight agreed that fuel injection and combustion had been
initiated in the rotary compressor's vent, with the novel detail that the
aircraft "flew for about a thousand feet before crashing into a wall." In 1990
at the 24th Symposium of the International Academy of Astronautics, one of the
papers presented included this sentence: "It is to Henri Coanda (1886â€“1972),
a world famous inventor and pioneer of jet flight, that space engineering
owesâ€”beside one of the first model planes provided with a rocket engine
(1905)â€”the construction and engine experiment of the first jet aircraft, the
'Coanda-1910'." In 2007 in his popular book "Extreme Aircraft", Ron Miller
wrote that the powerplant in the CoandÄƒ-1910 was one of the "earliest
attempts" at a jet engine, but was unsuccessfulâ€”it was "incapable of actual
flight", unlike the engines designed by Whittle and Ohain. The question of the
CoandÄƒ-1910 being the first jet aircraft does not appear to be resolved,
supporting Stine's view: "Whether Henri Coanda built the first true jet will
probably be argued interminably." In the 2000s, Dan Antoniu and other Romanian
aviation experts investigated existing photographs of the CoandÄƒ-1910, leading
them to believe that the aircraft presented at the exhibition was not finished,
that it was exhibited with many improvisations. Antoniu published "Henri
CoandÄƒ and his technical work during 1906â€“1918", a 2010 book in which he
said that the unfinished state of the aircraft led to CoandÄƒ filing several
extra patents and starting a new series of studies with the aim of making the
machine airworthy. For instance, Antoniu wrote that the exhaust pipes of the
ClergÃ©t engine appeared free; there were no devices to redirect exhaust gases
to the turbine as described in the patent, and there were no heat shields for
crew protection. As well, the central attachment of the tubular struts holding
the wings to the fuselage, with mere collars secured with screws, was judged by
Antoniu as appearing potentially unsafe during take-off or landing because of
the "considerable loads on the struts". The X-shaped empennage was covered at
high angles by the horizontal stabiliser making it unusable, and any high-speed
taxi would put the machine in danger of a nose-over. Memorials and models. A
full-size replica of the CoandÄƒ-1910 was built in 2001; it is displayed in
Bucharest at the National Military Museum. A scale model is displayed in the
French Air and Space Museum at Paris â€“ Le Bourget Airport. At the site of the
historic Issy-les-Moulineaux airfield, a large plaque lists the three pioneers
of flight most closely associated with the airfield: Louis BlÃ©riot, Alberto
Santos-Dumont and Henri Farman. Later, a plaque honouring CoandÄƒ and Romanian
aviation engineer Traian Vuia was placed on a nearby building under the
auspices of the mayor of Issy-les-Moulineaux, "L'AÃ©roclub de France", and the
Romanian Association for Aviation History. Construction on a full-sized
functional replica of the plane began in March 2010 at Craiova, Romania, by a
team of engineers and former test pilots from I.R.Av. Craiova. The replica is
based on plans that CoandÄƒ reworked in 1965 because the 1910 plans were lost.
It uses metal for the fuselage rather than wood, and its intended engine is a
true jet, the Motorlet M-701, made for the 1960s-era Aero L-29 DelfÃ­n military
trainer. In October 2010 the National Bank of Romania issued a commemorative
silver coin for the centennial of the building of the first jet aircraft. The
10-leu piece is intended for coin collectors, with the official purchase price
set at 220Â leu. It represents the aircraft on the obverse side and a portrait
of CoandÄƒ on the reverse, including Romanian words which translate to "first
jet aircraft". The same month the philatelic section of the Romanian Post,
"Romfilatelia", produced a limited edition philatelic folder and a stamp
commemorating the centennial of jet aircraft. The stamp presents a modern
internal schema of the CoandÄƒ-1910, a drawing of the injectors and burners,
and a quote from Gustave Eiffel: "This boy was born 30 if not 50 years too
early". At the European Parliament in December, president Jerzy Buzek opened a
centennial exhibition celebrating the building and testing of the CoandÄƒ-1910.
