Texas Revolution The Texas Revolution, also known as the Texas War of
Independence, was the military conflict between the government of Mexico and
Texas colonists that began October 2, 1835 and resulted in the establishment of
the Republic of Texas after the final battle on April 21, 1836. Intermittent
conflicts between the two nations continued into the 1840s, finally being
resolved with the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War of 1846 to 1848 after the annexation
of Texas to the United States. Long-running political and cultural clashes
between the Mexican government and the settlers in Texas were exacerbated after
conservative forces took control and the Siete Leyes (Seven Laws) of 1835 were
approved. It displaced the federal Constitution of 1824 with the 1835
Constitution of Mexico, thereby ending the federal system and establishing a
provisional centralized government in its place. The new laws were unpopular
throughout Mexico, leading to secession movements and violence in several
Mexican states. Open warfare began in Texas on October 2, 1835, with the Battle
of Gonzales. Early Texan Army successes at La Bah√≠a and San Antonio (Battle of
Goliad, Siege of B√©xar) were soon reversed when the Mexican Army retook the
territory a few months later (Battle of Coleto, Battle of the Alamo). The war
ended at the Battle of San Jacinto, where the Texian army under General Sam
Houston routed the Mexican forces with a surprise attack. Background. The
Mexican War for Independence (1810‚Äì1821) severed control that Spain had
exercised on its North American territories, and the new country of Mexico was
formed from much of the individual territory that had comprised New Spain. On
October 4, 1824, Mexico adopted a new constitution which defined the country as
a federal republic with nineteen states and four¬ territories. The former
province of Spanish Texas became part of a newly created state, Coahuila y
Tejas, whose capital was at Saltillo, hundreds of miles from the former Texas
capital, San Antonio de Bexar (now San Antonio, Texas, USA). The new country
emerged essentially bankrupt from the war against Spain. With little money for
the military, Mexico encouraged settlers to create their own militias for
protection against hostile Indian tribes. Texas was very sparsely populated and
in the hope that an influx of settlers could control the Indian raids, the
government liberalized immigration policies for the region. The first group of
colonists, known as the Old Three Hundred, had arrived in 1822 to settle an
empresarial grant that had been given to Stephen F. Austin. Of the 24
empresarios, only one settled citizens from within the Mexican interior; most
of the remaining settlers came from the United States. The Mexican-born
settlers in Texas were soon vastly outnumbered by people born in the United
States. To address this situation, President Anastasio Bustamante implemented
several measures on April 6, 1830. Chief among these was a prohibition against
further immigration to Tejas from the United States, although American citizens
would be allowed to settle in other parts of Mexico. Furthermore, the property
tax law, intended to exempt immigrants from paying taxes for ten years, was
rescinded, and tariffs were increased on goods shipped from the United States.
Bustamante also ordered all Tejas settlers to comply with the federal
prohibition against slavery or face military intervention. These measures did
not have the intended effect. Settlers simply circumvented or ignored the laws.
By 1834, it was estimated that over 30,000 Anglos lived in Coahuila y Tejas,
compared to only 7,800¬ Mexican-born citizens. By 1836, there were
approximately 5,000 slaves in Texas. Possible Role of Slavery. One possible
issue and motivation for the revolution was Mexico's prohibition of slavery.
The Mexican government had invited immigrants to Mexican Texas with the
understanding that they would produce food crops, insisting upon production of
corn, grain and beef. Former American settlers found such micromanagement of
the land use to be opposed to their economic interests in slavery. They tended
to ignore their contracts. If these were enforced, Texas slave-owners stood to
lose a large investment in slave labor. Cotton was in high demand throughout
Europe and so a lucrative export throughout the southern United States. Much of
the land being opened up to Anglos in Mexican Texas was well suited for cotton,
but raising cotton was a labor intensive endeavor at the time, and many Texans
thought that slave-labor was more profitable. Most of the American settlers in
Mexico were from southern states, where slavery was still legal. They even
brought their slaves with them. Because slavery was illegal in Mexico, these
settlers made their slaves sign agreements giving them the status of indentured
servants ‚Äì essentially slavery by another name. The Mexican authorities
nominally regulated this practice, and the issue continued to flare up,
especially when slaves ran escaped. By the 1830s, many settlers were afraid
that the Mexicans would take the slaves away, which made them favor
independence. Some non-slave-owning settlers recognized the economic impact of
the prohibition, and as potential beneficiaries of the slave-based economy,
supported independence as well. The significance of slavery in the Texas War
for Independence is unclear and difficult to determine. It is important to
address the fact that the Texas Declaration of Independence of 1836 does not
mention slavery, unlike Texas' 1861 Ordinance of Secession. Furthermore, the
vast majority of primary-sources from the period do not mention slavery as a
cause, but rather focus on issues such as religious freedom, the abrogation of
the Mexican Constitution, and land rights. Other Issues. Texans were becoming
increasingly disillusioned with the Mexican government. Many of the Mexican
soldiers garrisoned in Texas were convicted criminals who were given the choice
of prison or serving in the army in Texas. Many Texians were also unhappy with
the location of their state capital, which moved periodically between Saltillo
and Monclova, both of which were in southern Coahuila, some away; they wanted
Texas to be a separate state from Coahuila (but not independent from Mexico)
and to have its own capital. The other interest of the Texans was
representation of their interests in the government. They believed a closer
location for the capital would help to stem corruption and facilitate other
matters of government. Texans continued to lobby to overturn the laws of 1830.
In April 1833, settlers called a convention to discuss proposed changes in
immigration, judicial, and other political policies. The delegates also
advocated separate statehood for Texas and elected Austin to carry a proposed
state constitution to Mexico City. The new Mexican President, Antonio Lopez de
Santa Anna, approved many of the proposals, but refused to agree to separate
statehood; Austin was jailed when he wrote a letter advocating that Texans act
unilaterally on statehood. In 1834, because of perceived troubles within the
Mexican government, Santa Anna went through a process of dissolving state
legislatures, disarming state militias, and abolishing the Constitution of
1824. He also imprisoned some cotton plantation owners who refused to raise
their assigned crops, which were intended to be redistributed within Mexico
instead of being exported. Mexican preparation. In early 1835, as the Mexican
government transitioned from a federalist model to centralism, wary Texans
began forming Committees of Correspondence and Safety. A central committee in
San Felipe de Austin coordinated their activities. The Texians staged a minor
revolt against customs duties in June; these Anahuac Disturbances prompted
Mexican President Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna to send additional troops to
Texas. In July, Colonel Nicolas Condelle led 200¬ men to reinforce Presidio La
Bah√≠a. The following month, a contingent of soldiers arrived in B√©xar with
Colonel Domingo de Ugartechea. Fearing that stronger measures were needed to
quell the unrest, Santa Anna ordered his brother-in-law, General Mart√≠n
Perfecto de Cos to "repress with strong arm all those who, forgetting their
duties to the nation which has adopted them as her children, are pushing
forward with a desire to live at their own option without subjection to the
laws". Cos landed at the port of Copano on September 20 with approximately
500¬ soldiers. Austin was released in July, having never been formally charged
with sedition, and was in Texas by August. Austin saw little choice but
revolution. A consultation was scheduled for October to discuss possible formal
plans to revolt, and Austin sanctioned it. Texan Army offensive. Before the
consultation could happen, however, in accordance with Santa Anna‚Äôs
nationwide call to disarm state militias, Colonel Domingo Ugartechea, who was
stationed in San Antonio, ordered the Texans to return a cannon given to them
by Mexico that was stationed in Gonzales. The Texans refused. Ugartechea sent
Lieutenant Francisco de Casta√±eda and 100 dragoons to retrieve it. When he
arrived at the rain-swollen banks of the Guadalupe River near Gonzales, there
were just eighteen Texans to oppose him. Unable to cross, Casta√±eda
established a camp, and the Texians buried the cannon and called for
volunteers. The Texans stalled for several days until reinforcements arrived.
The Texan Army attacked early on October 2, 1835. The Battle of Gonzales ended
with a Mexican withdrawal. Two Mexican soldiers were killed, and one Texian was
injured when he fell off his horse during the skirmish. Over the next several
days, The Texian Army continued to gather at Gonzales. After learning of the
Texan Army victory, Cos made haste for B√©xar. He left with the bulk of his
soldiers on October 5, but because he was unable to find adequate
transportation, most of his supplies remained at La Bah√≠a. Unaware of Cos's
departure, on October 6 Texans in Matagorda decided to march on the Mexican
garrison at Presidio La Bah√≠a in Goliad. They intended to kidnap Cos and, if
possible, steal the estimated $50,000 that was rumored to accompany him. On
October 10, the Texians stormed the presidio, and the Mexican garrison
surrendered after a 30-minute battle. One Texian was wounded, and estimates of
Mexican casualties range from one to three soldiers killed and from three to
seven wounded. Approximately 20¬ soldiers escaped. They warned the garrisons at
Copano and Refugio of the advancing Texians; those garrisons abandoned their
posts and joined the soldiers at Fort Lipantitl√°n, near San Patricio. The
Texans confiscated over $10,000 in food, blankets, clothing, and other
provisions. For the next three months, the provisions were parceled out among
companies in the Texian Army. Over the next several days, The Texian Army
continued to gather at La Bahia. Austin ordered that 100¬ men remain at Goliad,
under the command of Captain Philip Dimmitt, while the rest should join the
Texian Army in marching on Cos's troops in B√©xar. Within days of his
appointment, Dimmitt began advocating for an attack on Fort Lipantitl√°n.
Dimmitt believed that Texian control of Fort Lipantitl√°n would "secure the
frontier, provide a vital station for defense, create instability among the
centralists, and encourage Mexican federalists". The Mexican soldiers at Fort
Lipantitl√°n intimidated the settlers in San Patricio, leaving them afraid to
openly support the federalists who defied Mexican president Antonio L√≥pez de
Santa Anna. On October 31, Dimmitt sent a group of men under Adjutant Ira
Westover to take the fort. They arrived at Fort Lipantitl√°n late on November 3
and took the undermanned fort without firing a shot. The next day, the Texians
dismantled the fort. As they prepared to return to Goliad, the remainder of the
Mexican garrison, who had been out on patrol, approached. The Battle of
Lipantitl√°n lasted only 30 minutes, and resulted in the retreat of the Mexican
soldiers. Their departure left only one remaining group of Mexican soldiers in
Texas, those under Cos at B√©xar. The Texian Army controlled the Gulf Coast, so
all communication with the Mexican interior would now be transferred overland.
The long journey left Cos unable to quickly request or receive reinforcements
or supplies. Siege of Bexar. While Dimmitt supervised the Texan Army forces
along the Gulf Coast, Stephen F. Austin worked to organize the men gathered in
Gonzales into a cohesive army. On October 13, Austin led the newly formed Texan
Army toward Bexar to engage Cos and his troops. One week later, the men reached
Salado Creek and initiated a siege of Bexar. The Texians gradually moved their
camp nearer Bexar, and on October 27 had made camp at Mission San Francisco de
la Espada. That afternoon Austin sent James Bowie and James Fannin with a
contingent of men to find a closer campsite. The men realized that Mission
Concepci√≥n was a good defensive spot. Rather than return immediately to
Austin, as their orders specified, Bowie and Fannin instead sent a courier to
bring Austin directions to Concepci√≥n. The next day, an angry Austin issued a
statement threatening officers who chose not to follow orders with court-
martial. Cos had learned that the Texan Army was temporarily divided and sent
Ugartechea and troops to engage Bowie and Fannin's men. The ensuing Battle of
Concepci√≥n, which historian J.R. Edmondson describes as "the first major
engagement of the Texas Revolution", was the last offensive against the Texian
Army that Cos would order. Although historian Alwyn Barr of Texas Tech
University believes that the battle "should have taught¬ ... lessons on Mexican
courage and the value of a good defensive position", historian Stephen Hardin
believes that "the relative ease of the victory at Concepci√≥n instilled in the
Texians a reliance on their long rifles and a contempt for their enemies". The
Texan Army volunteers had little or no experience as professional soldiers, and
by early November many had begun to miss their homes. As the weather turned
colder and rations grew smaller, many soldiers became sick, and groups of men
began to leave, most without permission. On November 18, however, a group of
volunteers from the United States, known as the New Orleans Greys, joined the
Texan Army. Unlike the majority of the Texian volunteers, the Greys looked like
soldiers, with uniforms, well-maintained rifles, adequate ammunition, and some
semblance of discipline. The Greys, as well as several companies of Texians who
had arrived recently, were eager to face the Mexican Army directly. The Texan
volunteers, however, were becoming discouraged with the siege. Within days
Austin resigned his command to become a commissioner to the United States;
Texan Army elected Edward Burleson as their new commander. On November 26,
Burleson received word that a Mexican pack train of mules and horses,
accompanied by 50‚Äì100¬ Mexican soldiers, was within of Bexar. After a near
mutiny, Burleson sent Bowie and William H. Jack with cavalry and infantry to
intercept the supplies. In the subsequent skirmish, the Mexican forces were
forced to retreat to San Antonio, leaving their cargo behind. To the
disappointment of the Texans, the saddlebags contained only fodder for the
horses; for this reason the battle was later known as the Grass Fight. Although
the victory briefly uplifted the Texian troops, morale continued to fall as the
weather turned colder and the men grew bored. Burleson proposed that the army
lift the siege and retreat to Goliad until spring. His war council was
ambivalent until Colonel Ben Milam stood up and yelled, "Who will go with old
Ben Milam into San Antonio?" Several hundred soldiers, including the New
Orleans Greys, agreed to participate in the attack, which commenced on December
5. Milam and Colonel Frank W. Johnson led two columns of men into the city, and
for the next few days they fought their way from house to house towards the
fortified plazas where the Mexican soldiers waited. Milam was killed by a
sharpshooter on December 7. On December 9, Cos and the bulk of his men withdrew
into the Alamo Mission on the outskirts of Bexar. Cos presented a plan for a
counterattack; cavalry officers believed that they would be surrounded by
Texians and refused their orders. Possibly 175‚Äìsoldiers from four of the
cavalry companies left the mission and rode south. Sanchez Navarro said the
troops were not deserting but misunderstood their orders and were withdrawing
all the way to the Rio Grande. The following morning, Cos called Sanchez
Navarro to the Alamo and gave him orders to "go save those brave men. ...
Approach the enemy and obtain the best terms possible". On December 11, the
Texans officially accepted Cos's surrender. Under the terms of the surrender,
Cos and his men would leave Texas and no longer fight against the Constitution
of 1824. With his departure, there was no longer an organized garrison of
Mexican troops in Texas, and many of the Texans believed that the war was over.
Johnson described the battle as "the period put to our present war". Burleson
resigned his leadership of the army on December 15 and returned to his home.
Many of the men did likewise, and Johnson assumed command of the 400 soldiers
who remained. Soon after, a new contingent of Texans and volunteers from the
United States arrived with more heavy artillery. According to Barr, the large
number of American volunteers "contributed to the Mexican view that Texan
opposition stemmed from outside influences". Within several weeks of the
Mexican surrender, Johnson and Dr. James Grant enticed 300 of the Texans to
join them in preparing to invade Mexico, leaving Colonel James C. Neill to
oversee the remaining 100¬ Texan Army soldiers garrisoned at the Alamo.
Although the Matamoros Expedition, as it came to be known, was but one of many
schemes to bring the war to Mexico, nothing came of it. On November 6, 1835,
the Tampico Expedition under Jos√© Antonio Mex√≠a left New Orleans, intending
to capture the town from the Centralists. The expedition failed. These
independent missions drained the Texan movement of supplies and men.
Provisional government. In November 1835 at San Felipe de Austin, the
Consultation (Texas) scheduled for the month before finally got underway after
enough delegates from the colonies arrived to signify a quorum. After bitter
debate, they finally created a provisional government that was not to be
separate from Mexico but only to oppose the Centralists. They elected Henry
Smith as governor, and Sam Houston was appointed commander-in-chief of the
regular Army of Texas. There was no regular army yet; Austin‚Äôs army was all
volunteers, so Houston would have to build one. Members of the regular army
would be paid in land. The provisional government commissioned privateers and
established a postal system. A merchant was sent to the U.S. to borrow
$100,000. They ordered hundreds of copies of various military textbooks. They
gave Austin the option to step down as commander of the Texan Army in B√©xar
and go to the U.S. as a commissioner. On November 24, 1835, Austin stepped down
as general. Elections were held, and Colonel Edward Burleson became Austin‚Äôs
successor. Santa Anna's offensive. Army of Operations. As early as October 27,
Santa Anna had been making plans to quell the unrest in Texas. He stepped down
from his duties as president to lead what he dubbed the Army of Operations in
Texas, which would relieve Cos and put an end to the Texan revolt. Santa Anna
and his soldiers believed that the Texians would be quickly cowed. The Mexican
Secretary of War, Jos√© Mar√≠a Tornel, wrote: "The superiority of the Mexican
soldier over the mountaineers of Kentucky and the hunters of Missouri is well
known. Veterans seasoned by 20¬ years of wars can't be intimidated by the
presence of an army ignorant of the art of war, incapable of discipline, and
renowned for insubordination." Foreigners landing on the coast of the Republic
or invading its territory by land, armed, and with the intent of attacking our
country, will be deemed pirates and dealt with as such, being citizens of no
nation presently at war with the Republic and fighting under no recognized
flag. Scott (2000), p. 71. In this time period, captured pirates were executed
immediately. The resolution thus gave the Mexican Army permission to take no
prisoners in the war against the Texians. Santa Anna also sent a strongly
worded letter to Andrew Jackson, the United States president, warning that any
Americans found fighting the Mexican government would be treated as pirates.
The letter was not widely distributed, and it is unlikely that most of the
American recruits serving in the Texian Army were aware that there would be no
prisoners of war. By December 1835 6,019¬ soldiers had gathered at San Luis
Potosi to march into Texas. Several of Santa Anna's officers argued that the
Army of Operations should advance along the coast, so that they would be able
to receive additional supplies via sea. Instead, Santa Anna ordered the army
inland to Bexar, the political center of Texas and the site of Cos's defeat;
Santa Anna wanted to restore the reputation of his family after his brother-in-
law's embarrassing surrender. The long march would also provide an opportunity
to train the new recruits. In late December, the army began the march north.
Progress was slow. There were not enough mules to transport all of the
supplies, and many of the teamsters, all civilians, quit when their pay was
delayed. The large number of "soldaderas"‚Äìwomen and children who followed the
army‚Äìreduced the already scarce supplies. The soldiers were soon reduced to
partial rations. After reaching Saltillo, the army halted for two weeks so that
Santa Anna could recover from an illness. Officers took advantage of the break
to train the men. Many of the new recruits did not know how to use the sights
of their guns, and many refused to fire from the shoulder because of the large
recoil. The march into Texas resumed on January 26, and the army crossed the
Rio Grande on February 12. Temperatures in Texas reached record lows, and by
February 13 an estimated of snow had fallen. A large number of the new recruits
were from the tropical climate of the Yucat√°n, and some of them died of
hypothermia. Others contracted dysentery. Soldiers who fell behind were
sometimes killed by Comanche raiding parties. Nevertheless, the army continued
to march toward Bexar. As they progressed, settlers in their path in South
Texas evacuated northward. The Mexican army ransacked and occasionally burned
the vacant homes. Alamo. The Mexican Army arrived in San Antonio on February
23, 1836. The Texian garrison was completely unprepared for the arrival of the
Mexican army and had to quickly gather food from the town to supply the Alamo.
By late afternoon Bexar was occupied by about 1500 Mexican troops, who quickly
raised a blood-red flag signifying no quarter. For the next thirteen days, the
Mexican army besieged the Alamo. Although there were several small skirmishes
that provided the defenders with much needed optimism, they had little real
impact. In the early hours of March 6, the Mexican army attacked the fort in
what became known as the Battle of the Alamo. Almost all of the Texian
defenders, estimated at 182‚Äì257 men, were killed, including James Bowie, Davy
Crockett and William B. Travis. Most Alamo historians agree that
400‚Äì600¬ Mexicans were killed or wounded. This would represent about one-
third of the Mexican soldiers involved in the final assault, which Todish
remarks is "a tremendous casualty rate by any standards". From Bexar, Santa
Anna divided his army and sent three flying columns across Texas. General Jose
de Urrea was to advance eastward on the Texans from the south, Santa Anna and
General Joaquin Ramirez y Sesma pushing from the center, and General Antonio
Gaona supplied to march north of the Texans to Nacogdoches and then turn to
block further retreat toward Louisiana. The objective was to force a decisive
battle over the Texian Army, now led by General Sam Houston. Goliad campaign.
General Jos√© Urrea marched into Texas from Matamoros, making his way north
following the coast of Texas, thus preventing any foreign aid by sea and
opening up an opportunity for the Mexican Navy to land much needed provisions.
After surprising Colonel Frank Johnson and his troops at the Battle of San
Patricio, Urrea's forces defeated a small Texan force at the Battle of Agua
Dulce on March 2, 1836. Urrea then led his troops toward Goliad, where Colonel
James Fannin commanded 450 of the only Texian Army troops outside the Alamo. On
March 10, Fannin had divided his force, by sending out 148 Texians with William
C. Francis, Amon B. King and William Ward to the Refugio area. In Refugio, the
Texians would fall into Urrea's path. The Texians repulsed several attacks and
inflicted heavy casualties at the Battle of Refugio. Fannin sent couriers with
word to rendezvous with him in Victoria and thus they broke off the attack.
However, some couriers had been captured, which ultimately provided Urrea with
precious details of Fannin's plans. Fannin was ordered by General Sam Houston
on March 11, 1836, to abandon Goliad and retreat to Victoria, but delayed his
retreat until March 19. His force of about 300 men were caught on the open
prairie at a slight depression near Coleto Creek and repulsed three charges at
a heavy cost in Mexican casualties, during this Battle of Coleto. Overnight,
Urrea's forces surrounded the Texans, brought up cannon and reinforcements, and
induced Fannin's surrender under terms the next day, March 20. About 342 of the
Texian troops captured during the Goliad Campaign were executed a week later on
Palm Sunday, March 27, 1836, under Santa Anna's direct orders, widely known as
the Goliad Massacre. According to Harbert Davenport, "The impact of the Goliad
Massacre was crucial. Until this episode Santa Anna's reputation had been that
of a cunning and crafty man, rather than a cruel one...together with the fall
of the Alamo, branded both Santa Anna and the Mexican people with a reputation
for cruelty and aroused the fury of the people of Texas, the United States, and
even Great Britain and France, thus considerably promoting the success of the
Texas Revolution." Meeting of two armies. Texan retreat: "The Runaway Scrape".
The term ‚ÄúRunaway Scrape‚Äù is used to refer to two aspects of the Revolution
upon word spreading of the fall of the Alamo. Both and either may be intended
depending upon context. In the first context the term refers to the military
retreat of the Texan forces under Houston. In the second, the reference is to
the civilian flight toward Louisiana. Houston immediately understood that his
small army was not prepared to fight Santa Anna out in the open. The Mexican
cavalry, experienced and feared, was something the Texians could not easily
defeat. Seeing that his only choice was to keep the army together enough to be
able to fight on favorable grounds, Houston ordered a retreat towards the U.S.
border, and many settlers also fled in the same direction. There is speculation
that one of the possible scenarios Houston envisioned was to actually lead his
Texan army into Louisiana (U.S. territory), whereupon an invading Mexican army
could be attacked not only by the retreating Texan army but also by American
forces summoned from garrisons in New Orleans. That Sam Houston was an old
friend of then U.S. president Andrew Jackson, and possibly had some
communication during this crucial period, and Stephen F. Austin was in New
Orleans during this time, lend a measure of credence to such speculation. On
its way toward Louisiana, the Texan army implemented a scorched earth policy,
denying much-needed food for the Mexican army. Soon, the rains made the roads
impassable, and the cold season made the list of casualties grow in both
armies. Santa Anna's army, always on the heels of Houston, gave unrelenting
chase. The town of Gonzales could not be defended by the Revolutionaries, so it
was put to the torch. The same fate awaited Austin's colony of San Felipe.
Despair grew among the ranks of Houston's men, and much animosity was aimed
towards him. All that impeded Santa Anna's advance were the swollen rivers,
which gave Houston a chance to rest and drill his army. Preceding the Texas
Army's eastward movement away from the Mexican Army, was the civilian exodus
toward the safety of Louisiana. At Mina, for example, the Texas Ranger unit was
divided so that half would protect the civilian evacuation and the remainder
would serve as the rear guard and scouts ("spies" they were called) during the
military retreat. During the period of the Runaway Scrape, Gaona's army was re-
directed from its original orders (to proceed to Nacogdoches via the San
Antonio Road in a flanking maneuver) to, instead, turn southeast and join the
main forces of Cos and Sesma at San Felipe. Santa Anna was not aware that
Houston and his army were, from March 30 through April 12, camped in the woods
along the Brazos only fifteen miles above the main Mexican forces who were
camped at San Felipe from April 7 through April 9. Gaona‚Äôs Division did not
arrive at San Felipe until April 17, having marched past the already deserted
Texian camp. The Texans remained undiscovered for nearly two weeks, allowing
the number of volunteers to increase and training them in military discipline.
Early on, Houston commandeered the Steamboat Yellowstone so as to facilitate
their safe and orderly crossing of the Brazos River when the troops were
prepared or should they be discovered. The Mexican Army had no knowledge as to
where the main body of Texans was during early April while the Texans knew the
location of the three Mexican forces. It was not until Santa Anna arrived in
Harrisburg and interrogated civilians there, that he learned Houston had been
camped so near his own forces on the Brazos. After crossing the Brazos, the
Texian Army marched due east as Houston received reports from his scouts to the
rear. This adds perspective to the speculation that Houston intended to flee
into US territory. It was an option, but not Houston's preferred option‚Äîhe
was looking for, and found, a weakness in Santa Anna's tactics. That weakness
came in the form of Santa Anna‚Äôs rapid pursuit intending to capture the
provisional Texan government. Leaving the main body of the Mexican Army behind
at the San Bernard River, Santa Anna assembled a smaller unit of his best
troops and hurried off toward New Washington on Trinity Bay just below San
Jacinto. It was at this time in which Houston turned toward Harrisburg to the
southeast at the famed "fork in the road." It was at that fork in the road at
which the Runaway Scrape had ended in military terms, while the civilians
continued to flee. From that moment, Houston was no longer in retreat, but
rather leading the Army to find a place to confront Santa Anna on Texas soil.
Santa Anna defeated. Events moved at a quick pace after Santa Anna decided to
divide his own flying column and race quickly towards Galveston, where members
of the Provisional Government had fled. Santa Anna hoped to capture the
Revolutionary leaders, and put an end to the war, which had proven costly and
prolonged. Santa Anna, as dictator of Mexico, felt the need to return to Mexico
City as soon as possible. Houston was informed of Santa Anna's unexpected move.
Numbering about 700, Santa Anna's column marched east from Harrisburg, Texas.
On April 20, both armies met at the San Jacinto River. Separating them was a
large sloping ground with tall grass, which the Texans used as cover. Santa
Anna, elated at finally having the Texas Army in front of him, waited for
reinforcements, which were led by General Cos. On that same day, a skirmish was
fought between the enemies, mostly cavalry, but nothing came of it. To the
dismay of the Texans, Cos arrived sooner than expected with 540 more troops,
swelling Santa Anna's army to over 1,200 men. About 3:30 in the afternoon on
April 21, after burning Vince's Bridge, the Texans surged forward, catching the
Mexican army by surprise. Hours before the attack, Santa Anna had ordered his
men to stand down, noting that the Texans would not attack his superior force.
Also, his army had been stretched to the limit of endurance by the ongoing
forced marches. His force was overwhelmed by Texans pushing into the Mexican
camp. An 18-minute-long battle ensued, but soon the defenses crumbled and a
massacre ensued. Santa Anna's entire force of men were killed or captured by
Sam Houston's heavily outnumbered army of Texans; only nine Texans died. This
decisive battle resulted in Texas's independence from Mexico. Santa Anna was
found in a swamp wearing the uniform of a common soldier and captured. He was
brought before Houston, who had been shot in the ankle and badly wounded. Santa
Anna agreed to end the campaign. General Vicente Filisola, noting the state of
his tired and hungry army, marched a force of 4,273 back to Mexico, but not
without protests from Urrea. Santa Anna was forced to sign two treaties, a
public treaty and a private stating the exchange of prisoners and to never
fight the Texans again. Only Santa Anna had been defeated, not the Army of
Operations, and Urrea felt that the campaign should continue, but Filisola
disagreed. Aftermath. With Santa Anna a prisoner, his captors forced him to
sign the Treaties of Velasco on May 14. The treaty recognized Texas'
independence and guaranteed Santa Anna's life. The initial plan was to send him
back to Mexico to help smooth relations between the two states. His departure
was delayed by a mob who wanted him dead. Santa Anna, declaring himself as the
only person who could bring about peace, was sent to Washington, D.C., by the
Texas government to meet President Jackson in order to guarantee independence
of the new republic. But unknown to Santa Anna, the Mexican government deposed
him "in absentia"; thus, he no longer had any authority to represent Mexico.
The Treaty of Velasco was never ratified in Mexico, and from the end of the
revolution to roughly the beginning of the Mexican-American War, the Texas navy
was tasked with forcing the Mexican Government to accept Texas independence.
Although fighting between the Mexican and Texian armies ceased for the time
being, battles on water and on the coast continued. Some of the notable naval
conflicts were the Battle of Brazos River, the Battle of Galveston Harbor and
the Naval Battle of Campeche. Santa Anna re-emerged as a hero during the Pastry
War in 1838. He was re-elected President, and in early 1842 under his orders,
expeditions into Texas were led by R√°fael V√°squez with 500 men, then General
Adrian Woll with 1,400 men. Mexican troops commanded by Vasquez occupied
Goliad, Refugio, and Victoria and, on March 5, entered San Antonio. On March
15, a Texian militia gathered in San Antonio only to find the Mexican troops
had left. On September 11, 1842, Woll's troops occupied San Antonio. On
September 17 or 18, over 200 Texian militia under Mathew Caldwell ambushed 500
of Woll's troops and won the Battle of Salado Creek. 53 Texians responding to
Caldwell's call for reinforcements were surprised near Salado Creek and killed,
many in cold blood after surrendering, in the Dawson Massacre. Woll retreated
to Mexico with many hostages, including the local judge, clerk, district
attorney and all attorneys attending the court session. These hostages remained
in captivity for several years. Texian's pursuing the Mexicans and seeking
retribution included the ill-fated Mier Expedition. Small clashes arose between
the two countries for several years afterward. The war between Texas and Mexico
did not truly come to an end until the Mexican-American War of 1846. Sam
Houston's victory at San Jacinto would earn him the presidency of Republic of
Texas twice. He later became a U.S. senator and governor of Texas. Stephen F.
Austin, after a lost bid for Texas's presidency in 1836, was appointed
Secretary of State but died two months later. Sam Houston eulogized Austin as
the "Father of Texas".
