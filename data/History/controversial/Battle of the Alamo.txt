Battle of the Alamo The Battle of the Alamo (February 23Â â€“ March 6, 1836)
was a pivotal event in the Texas Revolution. Following a 13-day siege, Mexican
troops under President General Antonio LÃ³pez de Santa Anna launched an assault
on the Alamo Mission near San Antonio de BÃ©xar (modern-day San Antonio, Texas,
USA). All but two of the Texian defenders were killed. Santa Anna's perceived
cruelty during the battle inspired many Texiansâ€”both Texas settlers and
adventurers from the United Statesâ€”to join the Texian Army. Buoyed by a
desire for revenge, the Texians defeated the Mexican Army at the Battle of San
Jacinto, on April 21, 1836, ending the revolution. Several months previously,
Texians had driven all Mexican troops out of Mexican Texas. Approximately
100Â Texians were then garrisoned at the Alamo. The Texian force grew slightly
with the arrival of reinforcements led by eventual Alamo co-commanders James
Bowie and William B. Travis. On February 23, approximately 1,500 Mexican troops
marched into San Antonio de BÃ©xar as the first step in a campaign to re-take
Texas. For the next 12 days the two armies engaged in several skirmishes with
minimal casualties. Aware that his garrison could not withstand an attack by
such a large force, Travis wrote multiple letters pleading for more men and
supplies, but fewer than 100 reinforcements arrived. In the early morning hours
of March 6, the Mexican Army advanced on the Alamo. After repulsing two
attacks, Texians were unable to fend off a third attack. As Mexican soldiers
scaled the walls, most of the Texian soldiers withdrew into interior buildings.
Defenders unable to reach these points were slain by the Mexican cavalry as
they attempted to escape. Between five and seven Texians may have surrendered;
if so, they were quickly executed. Most eyewitness accounts reported between
182 and 257 Texians dead, while most historians of the Alamo agree that
400â€“600 Mexicans were killed or wounded. Several noncombatants were sent to
Gonzales to spread word of the Texian defeat. The news sparked a panic, known
as "The Runaway Scrape", in which the Texian army, most settlers, and the new
Republic of Texas government fled from the advancing Mexican Army. Within
Mexico, the battle has often been overshadowed by events from the
Mexicanâ€“American War of 1846â€“48. In 19th-century Texas, the Alamo complex
gradually became known as a battle site rather than a former mission. The Texas
Legislature purchased the land and buildings in the early part of the 20th
century and designated the Alamo chapel as an official Texas State Shrine. The
Alamo is now "the most popular tourist site in Texas". The Alamo has been the
subject of numerous non-fiction works beginning in 1843. Most Americans,
however, are more familiar with the myths spread by many of the movie and
television adaptations, including the 1950s Disney miniseries "Davy Crockett"
and John Wayne's 1960 film "The Alamo". Background. Under President Antonio
LÃ³pez de Santa Anna, the Mexican government began to shift away from a
federalist model. The increasingly dictatorial policies, including the
revocation of the Constitution of 1824 in early 1835, incited many federalists
to revolt. The Mexican border region of Texas was largely populated by
immigrants from the United States. These were accustomed to a federalist
government and to extensive individual rights, and they were quite vocal in
their displeasure at Mexico's shift towards centralism. Already leery of
previous American attempts to purchase Texas, Mexican authorities blamed much
of the Texian unrest on American immigrants, most of whom had made little
effort to adapt to the Mexican culture. In October, Texians engaged Mexican
troops in the first official battle of the Texas Revolution. Determined to
quash the rebellion, Santa Anna began assembling a large force, the Army of
Operations in Texas, to restore order. Most of his soldiers were raw recruits,
and a large number had been forcibly conscripted. The Texians systematically
defeated the Mexican troops already stationed in Texas. The last group of
Mexican soldiers in the regionâ€”commanded by Santa Anna's brother-in-law,
General MartÃ­n Perfecto de Cosâ€”surrendered on December 9 following the siege
of BÃ©xar. By this point, the Texian Army was dominated by very recent arrivals
to the region, primarily adventurers from the United States. Many Texas
settlers, unprepared for a long campaign, had returned home. Angered by what he
perceived to be American interference in Mexican affairs, Santa Anna a
resolution classifying foreigners found fighting in Texas as pirates. The
resolution effectively banned the taking of prisoners of war: in this period of
time, captured pirates were executed immediately. Santa Anna reiterated this
message in a strongly worded letter to United States President Andrew Jackson.
This letter was not widely distributed, and it is unlikely that most of the
American recruits serving in the Texian Army were aware that there would be no
prisoners of war. When Mexican troops departed San Antonio de BÃ©xar (now San
Antonio, Texas, USA) Texian soldiers established a garrison at the Alamo
Mission, a former Spanish religious outpost which had been converted to a
makeshift fort. Described by Santa Anna as an "irregular fortification hardly
worthy of the name", the Alamo had been designed to withstand an attack by
native tribes, not an artillery-equipped army. The complex sprawled across ,
providing almost of perimeter to defend. An interior plaza was bordered on the
east by the chapel and to the south by a one-story building known as the Low
Barracks. A wooden palisade stretched between these two buildings. The two-
story Long Barracks extended north from the chapel. At the northern corner of
the east wall stood a cattle pen and horse corral. The walls surrounding the
complex were at least thick and ranged from high. To compensate for the lack of
firing ports, Texian engineer Green B. Jameson constructed catwalks to allow
defenders to fire over the walls; this method, however, left the rifleman's
upper body exposed. Mexican forces had left behind 19Â cannons, which Jameson
installed along the walls. A large 18-pounder had arrived in Texas with the New
Orleans Greys. Jameson positioned this cannon in the southwest corner of the
compound. He boasted to Texian Army commander Sam Houston that the Texians
could "whip 10 to 1 with our artillery". The Texian garrison was woefully
under-manned and under-provisioned, with fewer than 100Â soldiers remaining by
January 6, 1836. Colonel James C. Neill, the acting Alamo commander, wrote to
the provisional government: "If there has ever been a dollar here I have no
knowledge of it". Neill requested additional troops and supplies, stressing
that the garrison was likely to be unable to withstand a siege lasting longer
than four days. The Texian government was in turmoil and unable to provide much
assistance. Four different men claimed to have been given command over the
entire army: on January 14, Neill approached one of them, Sam Houston, for
assistance in gathering supplies, clothing, and ammunition. Prelude to battle.
Houston could not spare the number of men necessary to mount a successful
defense. Instead, he sent Colonel James Bowie with 30 men to remove the
artillery from the Alamo and destroy the complex. Bowie was unable to transport
the artillery since the Alamo garrison lacked the necessary draft animals.
Neill soon persuaded Bowie that the location held strategic importance. In a
letter to Governor Henry Smith, Bowie argued that "the salvation of Texas
depends in great measure on keeping BÃ©xar out of the hands of the enemy. It
serves as the frontier picquet guard, and if it were in the possession of Santa
Anna, there is no stronghold from which to repel him in his march toward the
Sabine." The letter to Smith ended, "Colonel Neill and myself have come to the
solemn resolution that we will rather die in these ditches than give it up to
the enemy." Bowie also wrote to the provisional government, asking for "men,
money, rifles, and cannon powder". Few reinforcements were authorized; cavalry
officer William B. Travis arrived in BÃ©xar with 30Â men on February 3. Five
days later, a small group of volunteers arrived, including the famous
frontiersman and former U.S. Congressman Davy Crockett of Tennessee. On
February 11, Neill left the Alamo, likely to recruit additional reinforcements
and gather supplies. He transferred command to Travis, the highest-ranking
regular army officer in the garrison. Volunteers comprised much of the
garrison, and they were unwilling to accept Travis as their leader. The men
instead elected Bowie, who had a reputation as a fierce fighter, as their
commander. Bowie celebrated by getting very intoxicated and creating havoc in
BÃ©xar. To mitigate the resulting ill feelings, Bowie agreed to share command
with Travis. As the Texians struggled to find men and supplies, Santa Anna
continued to gather men at San Luis Potosi; by the end of 1835 his army
numbered 6,019 soldiers. Rather than advance along the coast, where supplies
and reinforcements could be easily delivered by sea, Santa Anna ordered his
army inland to BÃ©xar, the political center of Texas and the site of Cos's
defeat. The army began its march north in late December. Officers used the long
journey to train the men. Many of the new recruits did not know how to use the
sights of their guns, and many refused to fire from the shoulder because of the
large recoil. Progress was slow. There were not enough mules to transport all
of the supplies, and many of the teamsters, all civilians, quit when their pay
was delayed. The large number of "soldaderas"â€“women and children who followed
the armyâ€“consumed the already scarce supplies. The soldiers were soon reduced
to partial rations. On February 12 they crossed the Rio Grande. Temperatures in
Texas reached record lows, and by February 13 an estimated of snow had fallen.
Hypothermia, dysentery, and Comanche raiding parties took a heavy toll on the
Mexican soldiers. On February 21, Santa Anna and his vanguard reached the banks
of the Medina River, from BÃ©xar. Unaware of the Mexican Army's proximity, the
majority of the Alamo garrison joined BÃ©xar residents at a . After learning of
the planned celebration, Santa Anna ordered General JoaquÃ­n RamÃ­rez y Sesma
to immediately seize the unprotected Alamo, but sudden rains halted that raid.
Siege. Investment. In the early hours of February 23, residents began fleeing
BÃ©xar, fearing the Mexican army's imminent arrival. Although unconvinced by
the reports, Travis stationed a soldier in the San Fernando church bell
towerâ€”the highest location in townâ€”to watch for signs of an approaching
force. Several hours later, Texian scouts reported seeing Mexican troops
outside the town. Few arrangements had been made for a potential siege. One
group of Texians scrambled to herd cattle into the Alamo, while others
scrounged for food in the recently abandoned houses. Several members of the
garrison who had been living in town brought their families with them when they
reported to the Alamo. Among these were Almaron Dickinson, who brought his wife
Susanna and their infant daughter Angelina; Bowie, who was accompanied by his
deceased wife's cousins, Gertrudis Navarro and Juana Navarro Alsbury, and
Alsbury's young son; and Gregorio Esparza, whose family climbed through the
window of the Alamo chapel after the Mexican army arrived. Other members of the
garrison failed to report for duty; most of the men working outside BÃ©xar did
not try to sneak past Mexican lines. By late afternoon BÃ©xar was occupied by
about 1,500 Mexican troops. When the Mexican troops raised a blood-red flag
signifying no quarter, Travis responded with a blast from the Alamo's largest
cannon. Believing that Travis had acted hastily, Bowie sent Jameson to meet
with Santa Anna. Travis was angered that Bowie had acted unilaterally and sent
his own representative, Captain Albert Martin. Both emissaries met with Colonel
Juan Almonte and JosÃ© Bartres. According to Almonte, the Texians asked for an
honorable surrender but were informed that any surrender must be unconditional.
On learning this, Bowie and Travis mutually agreed to fire the cannon again.
Skirmishes. The first night of the siege was relatively quiet. Over the next
few days, Mexican soldiers established artillery batteries, initially about
from the south and east walls of the Alamo. A third battery was positioned
southeast of the fort. Each night the batteries inched closer to the Alamo
walls. During the first week of the siege more than 200 cannonballs landed in
the Alamo plaza. At first the Texians matched Mexican artillery fire, often
reusing the Mexican cannonballs. On February 26 Travis ordered the artillery to
conserve powder and shot. Two notable events occurred on Wednesday, February
24. At some point that day, Bowie collapsed from illness, leaving Travis in
sole command of the garrison. Late that afternoon, a Mexican scout became the
first fatality of the siege. The following morning, 200â€“300 Mexican soldiers
crossed the San Antonio River and took cover in abandoned shacks near the Alamo
walls. Several Texians ventured out to burn the huts while Texians within the
Alamo provided cover fire. After a two-hour skirmish the Mexican troops
retreated to BÃ©xar. Two Mexican soldiers were killed and four wounded. No
Texians were injured. A blue norther blew in on February 25, dropping the
temperature to . Neither army was prepared for the cold temperatures. Texian
attempts to gather firewood were thwarted by Mexican troops. On the evening of
February 26 Colonel Juan Bringas engaged several Texians who were burning more
huts. According to historian J.R. Edmondson, one Texian was killed.
Reinforcements. Santa Anna posted one company east of the Alamo, on the road to
Gonzales. Almonte and 800Â dragoons were stationed along the road to Goliad.
Throughout the siege these towns had received multiple couriers, dispatched by
Travis to plead for reinforcements and supplies. The most famous of his
missives, written February 24, was addressed To the People of Texas & All
Americans in the World. According to historian Mary Deborah Petite, the letter
is "considered by many as one of the masterpieces of American patriotism".
Copies of the letter were distributed across Texas, and eventually reprinted
throughout the United States and much of Europe. At the end of the first day of
the siege, Santa Anna's troops were reinforced by 600 men under General Joaquin
Ramirez y Sesma, bringing the Mexican army up to more than 2,000 men. As news
of the siege spread throughout Texas, potential reinforcements gathered in
Gonzales. They hoped to rendezvous with Colonel James Fannin, who was expected
to arrive from Goliad with his garrison. On February 26, after days of
indecision, Fannin ordered 320Â men, fourÂ cannon, and several supply wagons to
march toward the Alamo, away. This group traveled less than before turning
back. Fannin blamed the retreat on his officers; the officers and enlisted men
accused Fannin of aborting the mission. Texians gathered in Gonzales were
unaware of Fannin's return to Goliad, and most continued to wait. Impatient
with the delay, on February 27 Travis ordered Samuel G. Bastian to go to
Gonzales "to hurry up reinforcements". According to historian Thomas Ricks
Lindley, Bastian encountered the Gonzales Ranging Company led by Lieutenant
George C. Kimble and Travis' courier to Gonzales, Albert Martin, who had tired
of waiting for Fannin. A Mexican patrol attacked, driving off four of the men,
including Bastian. In the darkness, the Texians fired on the remaining 32Â men,
whom they assumed were Mexican soldiers. One man was wounded, and his English
curses convinced the defenders to open the gates. On March 3, the Texians
watched from the walls as approximately 1,000 Mexican troops marched into
BÃ©xar. The Mexican army celebrated loudly throughout the afternoon, both in
honor of their reinforcements and at the news that troops under General JosÃ©
de Urrea had soundly defeated Texian Colonel Frank W. Johnson at the Battle of
San Patricio on February 27. Most of the Texians in the Alamo believed that
Sesma had been leading the Mexican forces during the siege, and they mistakenly
attributed the celebration to the arrival of Santa Anna. The reinforcements
brought the number of Mexican soldiers in BÃ©xar to almost 3,100. The arrival
of the Mexican reinforcements prompted Travis to send three men, including Davy
Crockett, to find Fannin's force, which he still believed to be en route. The
scouts discovered a large group of Texians camped from the Alamo. Lindley's
research indicates that up to 50 of these men had come from Goliad after
Fannin's aborted rescue mission. The others had left Gonzales several days
earlier. Just before daylight on March 4, part of the Texian force broke
through Mexican lines and entered the Alamo. Mexican soldiers drove a second
group across the prairie. Assault preparations. On March 4, the day after his
reinforcements arrived, Santa Anna proposed an assault on the Alamo. Many of
his senior officers recommended that they wait for two 12-pounder cannons
anticipated to arrive on March 7. That evening, a local woman, likely Bowie's
cousin-in-law Juana Navarro Alsbury, approached Santa Anna to negotiate a
surrender for the Alamo defenders. According to many historians, this visit
probably increased Santa Anna's impatience; as historian Timothy Todish noted,
"there would have been little glory in a bloodless victory". The following
morning, Santa Anna announced to his staff that the assault would take place
early on March 6. Santa Anna arranged for troops from BÃ©xar to be excused from
the front lines, so that they would not be forced to fight their own families.
Legend holds that at some point on March 5, Travis gathered his men and
explained that an attack was imminent, and that the Mexican Army would prevail.
He supposedly drew a line in the ground and asked those willing to die for the
Texian cause to cross and stand alongside him; only one man (Moses Rose) was
said to have declined. Most scholars disregard this tale as there is no primary
source evidence to support it (the story only surfaced decades after the battle
in a third-hand account). However, Travis apparently did, at some point prior
to the final assault, assemble the men for a conference to inform them of the
dire situation and giving them the chance to either escape or stay and die for
the cause. Susannah Dickinson recalled Travis announcing that any men who
wished to escape should let it be known and step out of ranks. The last Texian
verified to have left the Alamo was James Allen, a courier who carried personal
messages from Travis and several of the other men on March 5. Final assault.
Exterior fighting. At 10Â p.m. on March 5, the Mexican artillery ceased their
bombardment. As Santa Anna had anticipated, the exhausted Texians soon fell
into the first uninterrupted sleep many had gotten since the siege began. Just
after midnight Mexican troops began preparing for the final assault. The troops
were divided into four columns, commanded by Cos, Colonel Francisco Duque,
Colonel JosÃ© MarÃ­a Romero and Colonel Juan Morales. Veterans were positioned
on the outside of the columns to better control the new recruits and conscripts
in the middle. As a precaution, 500 Mexican cavalry were positioned around the
Alamo to prevent escape of either Texian or Mexican soldiers. Santa Anna
remained in camp with the 400 reserves. Despite the bitter cold, the soldiers
were ordered not to wear overcoats, which could impede their movements. Clouds
concealed the moon, and thus the movements of the soldiers. At 5:30Â a.m.
troops silently advanced. Cos and his men approached the northwest corner of
the Alamo, while Duque led his men from the northwest toward a repaired breach
in the Alamo's north wall. The column commanded by Romero marched towards the
east wall, and Morales's column aimed for the low parapet by the chapel. The
three Texian sentinels stationed outside the walls were killed in their sleep,
allowing Mexican soldiers to approach undetected within musket range of the
walls. At this point, the silence was broken by shouts of ""Â¡Viva Santa
Anna!"" and music from the buglers. The noise woke the Texians. Most of the
noncombatants gathered in the church sacristy for safety. Travis rushed to his
post yelling, "Come on boys, the Mexicans are upon us and we'll give them
hell!" and, as he passed a group of Tejanos, ""Â¡No rendirse, muchachos!"" ("No
surrender, boys"). In the initial moments of the assault Mexican troops were at
a disadvantage. Their column formation allowed only the front rows of soldiers
to fire safely. Unaware of the dangers, the untrained recruits in the ranks
"blindly fir their guns", injuring or killing the troops in front of them. The
tight concentration of troops also offered an excellent target for the Texian
artillery. Lacking canister shot, Texians filled their cannon with any metal
they could find, including door hinges, nails, and chopped-up horseshoes,
essentially turning the cannon into giant shotguns. According to the diary of
JosÃ© Enrique de la PeÃ±a, "a single cannon volley did away with half the
company of chasseurs from Toluca". Duque fell from his horse after suffering a
wound in his thigh and was almost trampled by his own men. General Manuel
CastrillÃ³n quickly assumed command of Duque's column. Although some in the
front of the Mexican ranks wavered, soldiers in the rear pushed them on. As the
troops massed against the walls, Texians were forced to lean over the walls to
shoot, leaving them exposed to Mexican fire. Travis became one of the first
defenders to die, shot while firing his shotgun into the soldiers below him.
Few of the Mexican ladders reached the walls. The few soldiers who were able to
climb the ladders were quickly killed or beaten back. As the Texians discharged
their previously loaded rifles, however, they found it increasingly difficult
to reload while attempting to keep Mexican soldiers from scaling the walls.
Mexican soldiers withdrew and regrouped, but their second attack was repulsed.
Fifteen minutes into the battle, they attacked a third time. During the third
strike, Romero's column, aiming for the east wall, was exposed to cannon fire
and shifted to the north, mingling with the second column. Cos's column, under
fire from Texians on the west wall, also veered north. When Santa Anna saw that
the bulk of his army was massed against the north wall, he feared a rout;
"panicked", he sent the reserves into the same area. The Mexican soldiers
closest to the north wall realized that the makeshift wall contained many gaps
and toeholds. One of the first to scale the 12-foot (3.7 m) wall was General
Juan Amador; at his challenge, his men began swarming up the wall. Amador
opened the postern in the north wall, allowing Mexican soldiers to pour into
the complex. Others climbed through gun ports in the west wall, which had few
defenders. As the Texian defenders abandoned the north wall and the northern
end of the west wall, Texian gunners at the south end of the mission turned
their cannon toward the north and fired into the advancing Mexican soldiers.
This left the south end of the mission unprotected; within minutes Mexican
soldiers had climbed the walls and killed the gunners, gaining control of the
Alamo's 18-pounder cannon. By this time Romero's men had taken the east wall of
the compound and were pouring in through the cattle pen. Interior fighting. As
previously planned, most of the Texians fell back to the barracks and the
chapel. Holes had been carved in the walls to allow the Texians to fire. Unable
to reach the barracks, Texians stationed along the west wall headed west for
the San Antonio River. When the cavalry charged, the Texians took cover and
began firing from a ditch. Sesma was forced to send reinforcements, and the
Texians were eventually killed. Sesma reported that this skirmish involved
50Â Texians, but Edmondson believes that number was inflated. The defenders in
the cattle pen retreated into the horse corral. After discharging their
weapons, the small band of Texians scrambled over the low wall, circled behind
the church and raced on foot for the east prairie, which appeared empty. As the
Mexican cavalry advanced on the group, Almaron Dickinson and his artillery crew
turned a cannon around and fired into the cavalry, probably inflicting
casualties. Nevertheless, all of the escaping Texians were killed. The last
Texian group to remain in the open were Crockett and his men, defending the low
wall in front of the church. Unable to reload, they used their rifles as clubs
and fought with knives. After a volley of fire and a wave of Mexican bayonets,
the few remaining Texians in this group fell back toward the church. The
Mexican army now controlled all of the outer walls and the interior of the
Alamo compound except for the church and rooms along the east and west walls.
Mexican soldiers turned their attention to a Texian flag waving from the roof
of one building. Four Mexicans were killed before the flag of Mexico was raised
in that location. For the next hour, the Mexican army worked to secure complete
control of the Alamo. Many of the remaining defenders were ensconced in the
fortified barracks rooms. In the confusion, the Texians had neglected to their
cannon before retreating. Mexican soldiers turned the cannon toward the
barracks. As each door was blown off Mexican soldiers would fire a volley of
muskets into the dark room, then charge in for hand-to-hand combat. Too sick to
participate in the battle, Bowie likely died in bed. Eyewitnesses to the battle
gave conflicting accounts of his death. Some witnesses maintained that they saw
several Mexican soldiers enter Bowie's room, bayonet him, and carry him alive
from the room. Others claimed that Bowie shot himself or was killed by soldiers
while too weak to lift his head. According to historian Wallace Chariton, the
"most popular, and probably the most accurate" version is that Bowie died on
his cot, "back braced against the wall, and using his pistols and his famous
knife." The last of the Texians to die were the 11 men manning the two 12-
pounder cannon in the chapel. A shot from the 18-pounder cannon destroyed the
barricades at the front of the church, and Mexican soldiers entered the
building after firing an initial musket volley. Dickinson's crew fired their
cannon from the apse into the Mexican soldiers at the door. With no time to
reload, the Texians, including Dickinson, Gregorio Esparza and James Bonham,
grabbed rifles and fired before being bayoneted to death. Texian Robert Evans,
the master of ordnance, had been tasked with keeping the gunpowder from falling
into Mexican hands. Wounded, he crawled toward the powder magazine but was
killed by a musket ball with his torch only inches from the powder. Had he
succeeded, the blast would have destroyed the church and killed the women and
children hiding in the sacristy. As soldiers approached the sacristy, one of
the young sons of defender Anthony Wolf stood to pull a blanket over his
shoulders. In the dark, Mexican soldiers mistook him for an adult and killed
him. Possibly the last Texian to die in battle was Jacob Walker, who attempted
to hide behind Susannah Dickinson and was bayoneted in front of the women.
Another Texian, Brigido Guerrero, also sought refuge in the sacristy. Guerrero,
who had deserted from the Mexican Army in December 1835, was spared after
convincing the soldiers he was a Texian prisoner. By 6:30Â a.m. the battle for
the Alamo was over. Mexican soldiers inspected each corpse, bayoneting any body
that moved. Even with all of the Texians dead, Mexican soldiers continued to
shoot, some killing each other in the confusion. Mexican generals were unable
to stop the bloodlust and appealed to Santa Anna for help. Although the general
showed himself, the violence continued and the buglers were finally ordered to
sound a retreat. For 15Â minutes after that, soldiers continued to fire into
dead bodies. Aftermath. Casualties. According to many accounts of the battle,
between five and seven Texians surrendered. Incensed that his orders had been
ignored, Santa Anna demanded the immediate execution of the survivors. Weeks
after the battle, stories circulated that Crockett was among those who
surrendered. However, Ben, a former American slave who cooked for one of Santa
Anna's officers, maintained that Crockett's body was found surrounded by "no
less than sixteen Mexican corpses". Historians disagree on which version of
Crockett's death is accurate. Santa Anna reportedly told Captain Fernando
Urizza that the battle "was but a small affair". Another officer then remarked
that "with another such victory as this, we'll go to the devil". In his initial
report Santa Anna claimed that 600Â Texians had been killed, with only
70Â Mexican soldiers killed and 300Â wounded. His secretary, RamÃ³n MartÃ­nez
Caro, later repudiated the report. Other estimates of the number of Mexican
soldiers killed ranged from 60â€“200, with an additional 250â€“300Â wounded.
Most Alamo historians place the number of Mexican casualties at
400â€“600Â Mexicans. This would represent about one-third of the Mexican
soldiers involved in the final assault, which Todish remarks is "a tremendous
casualty rate by any standards". Most eyewitnesses counted between
182â€“257Â Texians killed. Some historians believe that at least one Texian,
Henry Warnell, successfully escaped from the battle. Warnell died several
months later of wounds incurred either during the final battle or during his
escape as a courier. Mexican soldiers were buried in the local cemetery, Campo
Santo. Shortly after the battle, Colonel JosÃ© Juan Sanchez Navarro proposed
that a monument should be erected to the fallen Mexican soldiers. Cos rejected
the idea. The Texian bodies were stacked and burned. The only exception was the
body of Gregorio Esparza. His brother Francisco, an officer in Santa Anna's
army, received permission to give Gregorio a proper burial. The ashes were left
where they fell until February 1837, when Juan SeguÃ­n returned to BÃ©xar to
examine the remains. A simple coffin inscribed with the names Travis, Crockett,
and Bowie was filled with ashes from the funeral pyres. According to a March
28, 1837, article in the "Telegraph and Texas Register", SeguÃ­n buried the
coffin under a peach tree grove. The spot was not marked and cannot now be
identified. SeguÃ­n later claimed that he had placed the coffin in front of the
altar at the San Fernando Cathedral. In July 1936 a coffin was discovered
buried in that location, but according to historian Wallace Chariton it is
unlikely to actually contain the remains of the Alamo defenders. Fragments of
uniforms were found in the coffin, and it is known that the Alamo defenders did
not wear uniforms. Texian survivors. In an attempt to convince other slaves in
Texas to support the Mexican government over the Texian rebellion, Santa Anna
spared Travis's slave, Joe. The day after the battle, he interviewed each
noncombatant individually. Impressed with Susanna Dickinson, Santa Anna offered
to adopt her infant daughter Angelina and have the child educated in Mexico
City. Dickinson refused the offer, which was not extended to Juana Navarro
Alsbury for her son who was of similar age. Each woman was given a blanket and
two silver pesos. Alsbury and the other "Tejano" women were allowed to return
to their homes in BÃ©xar; Dickinson, her daughter and Joe were sent to
Gonzales, escorted by Ben. They were encouraged to relate the events of the
battle, and to inform the remainder of the Texian forces that Santa Anna's army
was unbeatable. Impact on revolution. During the siege, newly elected delegates
from across Texas met at the Convention of 1836. On March 2, the delegates
declared independence, forming the Republic of Texas. Four days later, the
delegates at the convention received a dispatch Travis had written March 3
warning of his dire situation. Unaware that the Alamo had fallen, Robert Potter
called for the convention to adjourn and march immediately to relieve the
Alamo. Sam Houston convinced the delegates to remain in Washington-on-the-
Brazos to develop a constitution. After being appointed sole commander of all
Texian troops, Houston journeyed to Gonzales to take command of the
400Â volunteers who were still waiting for Fannin to lead them to the Alamo.
Within hours of Houston's arrival on March 11, Andres Barcenas and Anselmo
Bergaras arrived with news that the Alamo had fallen and all Texians were
slain. Hoping to halt a panic, Houston arrested the men as enemy spies. They
were released hours later when Susannah Dickinson and Joe reached Gonzales and
confirmed the report. Realizing that the Mexican army would soon advance toward
the Texian settlements, Houston advised all civilians in the area to evacuate
and ordered his new army to retreat. This sparked a mass exodus, known as the
Runaway Scrape, and most Texians, including members of the new government, fled
east. Despite their losses at the Alamo, the Mexican army in Texas outnumbered
the Texian army by almost six to one. Santa Anna assumed that knowledge of the
disparity in troop numbers and the fate of the Texian soldiers at the Alamo
would quell the resistance, and that Texian soldiers would quickly leave the
territory. News of the Alamo's fall had the opposite effect, and men flocked to
Houston's army. The "New York Post" editorialized that "had Anna treated the
vanquished with moderation and generosity, it would have been difficult if not
impossible to awaken that general sympathy for the people of Texas which now
impels so many adventurous and ardent spirits to throng to the aid of their
brethren". On the afternoon of April 21 the Texian army attacked Santa Anna's
camp near Lynchburg Ferry. The Mexican army was taken by surprise, and the
Battle of San Jacinto was essentially over after 18Â minutes. During the
fighting, many of the Texian soldiers repeatedly cried "Remember the Alamo!"
Santa Anna was captured the following day, and reportedly told Houston: "That
man may consider himself born to no common destiny who has conquered the
Napoleon of the West. And now it remains for him to be generous to the
vanquished." Houston replied, "You should have remembered that at the Alamo".
Santa Anna was forced to order his troops out of Texas, ending Mexican control
of the province and giving some legitimacy to the new republic. Legacy.
Following the battle, Santa Anna was alternately viewed as a national hero or a
pariah. Mexican perceptions of the battle often mirrored the prevailing
viewpoint. Santa Anna had been disgraced following his capture at the Battle of
San Jacinto, and many Mexican accounts of the battle were written by men who
had been, or had become, his outspoken critics. Petite and many other
historians believe that some of the stories, such as the execution of Crockett,
may have been invented to further discredit Santa Anna. In Mexican history, the
Texas campaign, including the Battle of the Alamo, was soon overshadowed by the
Mexicanâ€“American War of 1846â€“48. In San Antonio de BÃ©xar, the largely
"Tejano" population viewed the Alamo complex as more than just a battlesite; it
represented decades of assistanceâ€”as a mission, a hospital, or a military
post. As the English-speaking population increased, the complex became best
known for the battle. Focus has centered primarily on the Texian defenders,
with little emphasis given to the role of the "Tejano" soldiers who served in
the Texian army or the actions of the Mexican army. In the early 20th century
the Texas Legislature purchased the property and appointed the Daughters of the
Republic of Texas as permanent caretakers of what is now an official state
shrine. In front of the church, in the center of Alamo Plaza, stands a
cenotaph, designed by Pompeo Coppini, which commemorates the Texians and
"Tejanos" who died during the battle. According to Bill Groneman's
"Battlefields of Texas", the Alamo has become "the most popular tourist site in
Texas". The first English-language histories of the battle were written and
published by Texas Ranger and amateur historian John Henry Brown. The next
major treatment of the battle was Reuben Potter's "The Fall of the Alamo",
published in "The Magazine of American History" in 1878. Potter based his work
on interviews with many of the Mexican survivors of the battle. The first full-
length, non-fiction book covering the battle, John Myers Myers' "The Alamo",
was published in 1948. In the decades since, the battle has featured
prominently in many non-fiction works. According to Todish "et al.", "there can
be little doubt that most Americans have probably formed many of their opinions
on what occurred at the Alamo not from books, but from the various movies made
about the battle." The first film version of the battle appeared in 1911, when
Gaston MÃ©liÃ¨s directed "The Immortal Alamo". The battle became more widely
known after it was featured in the 1950s Disney miniseries "Davy Crockett",
which was largely based on myth. Within several years, John Wayne directed and
starred in one of the best-known, but questionably accurate, film versions,
1960's "The Alamo". In 2004 another film, also called "The Alamo", was
released. CNN described it as possibly "the most character-driven of all the
movies made on the subject". It is also considered more faithful to the actual
events than other movies. Modern popular culture. A number of songwriters have
been inspired by the Battle of the Alamo. Tennessee Ernie Ford's "The Ballad of
Davy Crockett" spent 16Â weeks on the country music charts, peaking at No. 4 in
1955. Marty Robbins recorded a version of the song "The Ballad of the Alamo" in
1960 which spent 13Â weeks on the pop charts, peaking at No. 34. Jane Bowers'
song "Remember the Alamo" has been recorded by artists including Johnny Cash
and Donovan.
