East Germany The German Democratic Republic (GDR; German: "Deutsche
Demokratische Republik" or "DDR"), informally known in English as East Germany,
was a socialist state established by the Soviet Union in 1949 out of the Soviet
zone of occupied Germany, including East Berlin of the Allied-occupied capital
city. The GDR had an area of 107,771¬ km2 (41,610¬ mi2), bordering
Czechoslovakia to the south, West Germany to the south and west, Poland to the
east, and the Baltic Sea to the north. East Germany ceased to exist when its
federal states were re-established and acceded to the Federal Republic of
Germany on 3 October 1990 (see German reunification). The GDR had a complex and
controversial history. While the Western government, which acknowledged itself
as the legal successor to the Third Reich, was regarded by the East as nothing
other than an extension of the old Nazi regime, those who opposed the East
regarded it as a puppet state for the Soviet Union. During the years of Nazi
control, it was taught that Russians, along with all Slavic peoples, were
""Untermenschen"" ‚Äì or ""sub-human"". Because of this, some East Germans saw
the Soviet occupation of their country as shameful and regarded the new regime
with contempt. The Socialist Unity Party, formed out of the merging of the
Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party, was often referred to by such
people as the "Russian Party". The combination of the state's perceived
illegitimacy by some East Germans and post-war economic problems resulted in
2.7 million East Germans violating the GDR ban on leaving the country by going
to West Germany in the 1950s. Frontier barriers were constructed to prevent
further depopulation caused by emigration to West Germany, the most prominent
of which being the Anti-Fascist Protection Wall ‚Äì commonly known as the
"Berlin Wall" ‚Äì constructed in 1961, which finally closed the loop hole in
the GDR border between East Berlin and West Berlin. In 1989, a non-violent
movement called for the end of German division and for the expansion of civil
liberties. A border security crisis ensued resulting in many GDR citizens
emigrating through Czechoslovakia and Hungary. The Soviet Union, under the
reformist leadership of Mikhail Gorbachev, refused to intervene on the basis of
his policy to de-escalate the Cold War and let East Germany resolve its own
crisis. On 9 November, destruction of the Berlin Wall began. On 3 October 1990,
the five states of the German Democratic Republic joined the Federal Republic
of Germany, ending over 40 years of division and becoming a single Germany.
Naming conventions. The official name was "Deutsche Demokratische Republik"
(German Democratic Republic), usually abbreviated as "DDR". Both terms were
used in East Germany with an increasing emphasis on the abbreviated name,
especially since East Germany considered West Germans and West Berliners to be
foreigners following the promulgation of its second constitution in 1968.
"Ostzone" (Eastern Zone) or "Soviet Zone" were two surrogate names for East
Germany that were often used colloquially. The different names used to describe
the German Democratic Republic reflected political positions during the Cold
War conflict; for example, many Westerners doubted the political sovereignty
and democratic constitution of East Germany. Surrogate name usage for East
Germany could thus reveal the political leaning of a person or news source. So
the media controlled by the East German government emphasised the use of the
official name, DDR, while West Germans, western media and statesmen may have
used other names such as Middle Germany, emphasising the location of East
Germany in the centre of pre-1937 Germany. The name Sowjetische Besatzungszone
(Soviet Occupation Zone, often abbreviated to SBZ) was used by those who wanted
to indicate that East Germany lacked sovereignty, whereas others used "Ostzone"
or "der Osten" ("Eastern Zone" or "the East") to avoid the actual name of the
state. The latter term, because it was based plainly on geographic location,
was sometimes also used by East Germans. Some West German media referred to
East Germany initially as the "SBZ" and later consistently named it the "so-
called "GDR"" (sogenannte "DDR"). However, over time East Germany's
abbreviation "DDR" became colloquial also among most West Germans and West
German media. "Ostdeutschland" (an ambiguous term meaning simultaneously East
or Eastern Germany) was not commonly used in East or West German common
parlance to refer to the German Democratic Republic, because "Ostdeutschland"
usually referred to the former eastern territories of Germany. The term
"Westdeutschland" (West Germany) when used by West Germans was almost always a
reference to the geographic region of Western Germany but not to the area
within the boundaries of the Federal Republic of Germany. However, this usage
was not always consistent, as, for example, West Berliners frequently applied
the term "Westdeutschland" to denote the Federal Republic. History. Explaining
the internal impact of the DDR regime from the perspective of German history in
the long term, historian Gerhard A. Ritter (2002) has argued that the East
German state was defined by two dominant forces ‚Äì Soviet Communism on the one
hand, and German traditions filtered through the interwar experiences of German
Communists on the other. It always was constrained by the powerful example of
the increasingly prosperous West, to which East Germans compared their nation.
The changes wrought by the Communists were most apparent in ending capitalism
and transforming industry, agriculture, in the militarization the society, and
the political thrust of the educational system and the media. On the other
hand, there was relatively little change made in the historically independent
domains of the sciences, the engineering professions, the Protestant churches,
and in many bourgeois life styles. Social policy, says Ritter, became a
critical legitimization tool in the last decades and mixed socialist and
traditional elements about equally. Origins. At the Yalta Conference during
World War II, the Allies (the U.S., Britain, and the Soviet Union) agreed on
dividing a defeated Germany into occupation zones, and on dividing Berlin, the
German capital, among the Allied powers as well. Initially this meant the
construction of three zones of occupation, i.e., American, British, and Soviet.
Later, a French zone was carved out of the American and British zones. GDR
created 1949. The ruling Communist party, known as the "Socialist Unity Party"
(SED), was formed in April 1946 from the merger between the German Communist
Party (KPD) and the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) by mandate of
Joseph Stalin. The two former parties were notorious rivals when they were
active before the Nazis consolidated all power and criminalised their
agitation. The unification of the two parties was symbolic of the new
friendship of German socialists in defeating their common enemy, however,
Communists who made a majority had virtually total control over policy. As
Walter Ulbricht noted, everything was made to look democratic while in reality
Communists retained control in the background. They were totally loyal to
Stalin, and realized their regime would collapse if it lost the backing of the
Soviet army‚Äîas indeed happened in 1989. Historians debate whether the
decision to form a separate country was initiated by Stalin or by the SED. As
West Germany was reorganized and gained independence from the occupation, the
German Democratic Republic was established in East Germany in 1949. The
creation of the two states made the 1945 division of Germany permanent. On 10
March 1952, (in what would become known as the "Stalin Note") Stalin put forth
a proposal to reunify Germany with a policy of neutrality, with no conditions
on economic policies and with guarantees for "the rights of man and basic
freedoms, including freedom of speech, press, religious persuasion, political
conviction, and assembly" and free activity of democratic parties and
organizations. However, leadership of West Germany saw reunification as a
rather abstract goal. Western powers chose to decline on this proposal, due to
belief that Germany should be able to join NATO and that such a negotiation
with the Soviet Union would be seen as a capitulation. Afterwards, there had
been several debates about whether a real chance for reunification had been
missed in 1952. In 1949 the Soviets turned control of East Germany over to the
Socialist Unity Party, headed by Wilhelm Pieck (1876‚Äì1960), who became
president of the GDR and remained officially 'Number One' until his death in
1960, while most executive authority was assumed by SED General Secretary
Walter Ulbricht. Socialist leader Otto Grotewohl (1894‚Äì1964) became prime
minister until his death. In a major speech to an SED party conference on 28
March 1956, Grotewohl condemned abuses in the legal system. He denounced
illegal arrests, called for more respect for civil rights, and even asked the
parliament to develop lively debate. West Germany saw itself as the legal
successor to the Third Reich, shouldering the burdens of legal responsibility
for its crimes. By contrast, East Germany renounced ties to the Nazi past,
styling itself the "anti-fascist rampart" and proclaiming itself the first
socialist state on German soil. It refused to admit existences of anti-semitism
and refused to recognize Israel or reimburse victims of the Holocaust. The SED
set a primary goal of ridding the GDR of all traces of the fascist regime, by
ensuring democratic elections and the protection of individual liberties in the
building up socialism. Soviet role. In 1955, the USSR declared the Soviet
occupation zone ‚Äì the historic middle portion of Germany ‚Äì to be a
sovereign state named the "Deutsche Demokratische Republik" (German Democratic
Republic, established in 1949), while the Red Army and the Western Allies'
occupation forces remained in place under the tripartite Potsdam Agreement
(1945) which established the Allied Occupation of Germany. The Communist German
Democratic Republic was established in the historic "Mitteldeutschland" (Middle
Germany). Former German territories east of the Oder and Neisse rivers, mainly
the Prussian provinces of Pomerania, East Prussia, West Prussia, Upper Silesia,
Lower Silesia, the eastern Neumark of Brandenburg, and a small piece of Saxony
were thus detached from Germany. To compensate Poland for the USSR's annexation
of its eastern provinces, the Allies provisionally established Poland's post-
war western border at the Oder‚ÄìNeisse line at the Yalta Conference (1945). As
a result, most of Germany's central territories became the "Sowjetische
Besatzungszone" (SBZ, Soviet Occupation Zone). All other lands east of the
Oder‚ÄìNeisse line were put under Polish administration, with the exception of
historic northern East Prussia, which went to the USSR. Zones of occupation. In
the Yalta and Potsdam conferences, the Allies established their joint military
occupation and administration of Germany via the Allied Control Council (ACC),
a four-power (US, UK, USSR, France) military government effective until the
restoration of German sovereignty. In eastern Germany, the Soviet Occupation
Zone (SBZ ‚Äì "Sowjetische Besatzungszone") comprised the five states
("L√§nder") of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Brandenburg, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, and
Thuringia. Disagreements over the policies to be followed in the occupied zones
quickly led to a breakdown in cooperation between the four powers, and the
Soviets administered their zone without regard to the policies implemented in
the other zones. The Soviets withdrew from the ACC in 1948; subsequently as the
other three zones were increasingly unified and granted self-government, the
Soviet administration facilitated the development of a separate socialist
government in its zone. Yet, seven years after the Allies‚Äô Potsdam Agreement
to a unified Germany, the USSR via the Stalin Note (10 March 1952) proposed
German reunification and superpower disengagement from Central Europe, which
the three Western Allies (US, France, UK) rejected. Soviet leader Joseph
Stalin, a communist proponent of reunification, was dead by March 1953.
Similarly, Lavrenty Beria, the First Deputy Prime Minister of the USSR, pursued
German reunification, but an internal (Party) "coup d‚Äô√©t√¢t" deposed him
from government in mid-1953, before he could act on the matter. His successor,
Nikita Khrushchev, rejected reunification as equivalent to returning East
Germany for annexation to the West; hence reunification went unconsidered until
the German Democratic Republic collapsed in 1989. East Germany and the Eastern
Bloc diplomatically recognised East Berlin as the capital city of the German
Democratic Republic, but the Western Allies disputed said recognition,
considering the entire city of Berlin an occupied territory governed by the
martial law of the Allied Control Council. According to Margarete Feinstein,
East Berlin's status as the capital was largely unrecognized by the West and
most Third World countries. In practice, the ACC‚Äôs authority was rendered
moot by the Cold War, and the East German government ignored the legal
restrictions on integration of East Berlin into the GDR. Abetted by ACC‚Äôs
weakness, Cold War political conflicts among the Allies over the status of West
Berlin provoked the Berlin Blockade (24 June 1948 ‚Äì 12 May 1949), in which
the Soviet army stopped all Allied rail, road, and water traffic to and from
West Berlin. The Allies countered the Soviets with the Berlin Airlift
(1948‚Äì49) of food, fuel, and supplies to keep West Berlin alive. Partition.
In 1946, the Communist Party of Germany ("Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands"
‚Äì KPD) and the Social Democratic Party of Germany ("Sozialdemokratische
Partei Deutschlands" ‚Äì SPD) merged to form the Socialist Unity Party of
Germany (SED ‚Äì "Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands") (21 April 1945),
which then won the elections of 1946, held under the oversight of the Soviet
army. Being a Marxist-Leninist political party, the SED's government
nationalised infrastructure and industrial plants. In 1948, the German Economic
Commission (Deutsche Wirtschaftskomission‚ÄîDWK) under its chairman Heinrich
Rau assumed administrative authority in the Soviet occupation zone, thus
becoming the predecessor of an East German government. On 7 October 1949, the
SED established the "Deutsche Demokratische Republik" (German Democratic
Republic ‚Äì GDR), based on a socialist political constitution establishing its
control of the anti-fascist National Front of the German Democratic Republic
(NF ‚Äì "Nationale Front der Deutschen Demokratischen Republik"), an omnibus
alliance of every party and mass organisation in East Germany. The NF was
established to stand for election to the "Volkskammer" ("People's Chamber"),
the East German parliament. The first (and only) President of the German
Democratic Republic was Wilhelm Pieck. However, after 1950, the true ruler of
East Germany was Walter Ulbricht, the First Secretary of the SED. On 16 June
1953, workers constructing the new "Stalinallee" boulevard in East Berlin
rioted against a 10% production quota increase. Initially a labour protest, it
soon included the general populace, who added their anti-Soviet discontent to
the workers' civil disobedience, and on 17 June similar protests occurred
throughout the GDR, with more than a million people striking in some 700 cities
and towns. Fearing anti-communist counter-revolution on 18 June 1953, the
government of the GDR enlisted the Soviet Occupation Forces to aid the
"Volkspolizei" ("People's Police") in suppressing the rioters; some fifty
people were killed and some 10,000 were jailed. (See Uprising of 1953 in East
Germany.) The German war reparations owed to the USSR impoverished the Soviet
Zone of Occupation and severely weakened the East German economy. In the
1945‚Äì46 period, the Soviets confiscated and transported to the USSR
approximately 33% of the industrial plant and by the early 1950s had extracted
some US$10 billion in reparations in agricultural and industrial products. The
poverty of East Germany induced by reparations provoked the "Republikflucht"
("flight from the republic") to West Germany, aggravating the emigration,
continual since the 1940s, from the Soviet zone of Germany to the Western
Allied zones, further weakening the GDR's economy. Western economic
opportunities and lack of political freedom in East Germany induced a brain
drain. In response, the GDR closed the Inner German Border, and on the night of
12‚Äì13 August 1961, East German soldiers began erecting the Berlin Wall which
prevented anyone from escaping. In 1971, Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev had
Ulbricht removed; Erich Honecker replaced him. While the Ulbricht government
had experimented with liberal reform, the Honecker government increased
controls upon the populace of the GDR. The new government introduced a new East
German Constitution which defined the German Democratic Republic as a "republic
of workers and peasants" and hardly mentioned the word "German". Initially,
East Germany maintained that it was the only lawful government of Germany.
However, from the 1960s onward, East Germany held itself out as a separate
country from West Germany, and shared the legacy of the united German state of
1871‚Äì1945. West Germany, in contrast, claimed an exclusive mandate for all of
Germany. From 1949 to the early 1970s, West Germany maintained that East
Germany was an illegally constituted state. It argued that the GDR was a Soviet
puppet regime and thus illegitimate. This position was shared by most of the
world, until 1973. East Germany was recognized only by Communist countries and
the Arab bloc, along with some "scattered sympathizers". According to the
Hallstein Doctrine (1955), West Germany also did not diplomatically recognize
any country ‚Äì except the USSR ‚Äì that recognized East German sovereignty.
But in the early 1970s, the "Ostpolitik" ("Eastern Policy") of "Change Through
Rapprochement" of the pragmatic government of FRG Chancellor Willy Brandt,
established normal diplomatic relations with the East Bloc states and the GDR.
In the event, the Treaty of Moscow (August 1970), the Treaty of Warsaw
(December 1970), the Four Power Agreement on Berlin (September 1971), the
Transit Agreement (May 1972), and the Basic Treaty (December 1972) established
normal relations between the Germanies, later allowing their integration to the
United Nations. This also increased the number of countries recognizing East
Germany to 55, including the US, UK and France, though the last three still
refused to recognize East Berlin as the capital, and insisted on a specific
provision in the UN resolution accepting the two Germanies into the UN to that
affect. GDR identity. From the beginning, the newly formed GDR tried to
establish its own separate identity. Because of Marx's abhorrence of Prussia,
the SED repudiated continuity between Prussia and the GDR. The SED destroyed
the Junker manor houses, wrecked the Berlin city palace and removed the
equestrian statue of Frederick the Great from East Berlin. Instead the SED
focused on the progressive heritage of German history, including Thomas
M√ºntzer's role in the German Peasants' War and the role played by the heroes
of the class struggle during Prussia's industrialization. Nevertheless, as
early as 1956 East Germany's Prussian heritage asserted itself in the NVA. As a
result of the Ninth Party Congress in May 1976, East Germany after 1976‚Äì77
considered its own history as the essence of German history, in which West
Germany was only an episode. It laid claim to reformers such as Karl Freiherr
vom Stein, Karl August von Hardenberg, Wilhelm von Humboldt, and Gerhard von
Scharnhorst. In the early 1980s, West Germany adopted the line of "two German
states in one German nation". While it respected East Germany's independence,
it formally maintained that the GDR was merely a "de facto" government within a
single German nation of which the FRG was the sole representative. For
instance, it did not treat East Germans as foreigners. The "Wende". In 1989,
following widespread public anger over the faking of results of local
government elections that spring, many citizens applied for exit visas or left
the country contrary to DDR laws. In August 1989 Hungary removed its border
restrictions and unsealed its border, and more than 13,000 people left East
Germany by crossing the "green" border via Czechoslovakia into Hungary and then
on to Austria and West Germany. Many others demonstrated against the ruling
party, especially in the city of Leipzig. Kurt Masur, the conductor of the
Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, led local negotiations with the government and
held town meetings in the concert hall. The demonstrations eventually led Erich
Honecker to resign in October, and he was replaced by a slightly more moderate
communist, Egon Krenz. On 9 November 1989, a few sections of the Berlin Wall
were opened, resulting in thousands of East Germans crossing into West Berlin
and West Germany for the first time. Krenz resigned a few days later, and the
SED abandoned power shortly afterward. Although there were some limited
attempts to create a permanent democratic East Germany, these were soon
overwhelmed by calls for unification with West Germany. East Germany held its
last elections in March 1990. The winner was a coalition headed by the East
German branch of West Germany's Christian Democratic Union, which advocated
speedy reunification. After some negotiations (2+4 Talks) were held involving
the two German states and the former Allied Powers which led to agreement on
the conditions for German unification. The five original East German states
that had been abolished in 1952 were recreated. On 3 October 1990, the five
states officially joined the Federal Republic of Germany, while East and West
Berlin united as a third city-state (in the same manner as Bremen and Hamburg).
On July 1st a currency-union had preceded the political union - the "Ostmark"
was abolished, the Western German "Deutsche Mark" became common currency. The
great economic and socio-political inequalities between the former Germanies
required government subsidy for the full integration of East Germany to the
Federal German Republic. Because of the deindustrialization taking place in he
outcome of this economic reunion, the matter is disputed in political conflicts
up to the present day. Most times the lack of efficiency of the East German
Economy is highlighted and the de-industrialization seen as natural outcome of
the "Wende". But many East German critics point out that the shock-therapy
style of privatization did not leave room for east German Enterprises to adapt.
Politics. There were four periods in East German political history. These
included: 1949‚Äì61, which saw the building of socialism; 1961‚Äì1970 after the
Berlin Wall closed off escape was a period of stability and consolidation;
1971‚Äì85 was termed the Honecker Era, and saw closer ties with West Germany;
and 1985‚Äì89 saw the decline and extinction of East Germany. Organization. The
ruling political party in East Germany was the "Sozialistische Einheitspartei
Deutschlands" (Socialist Unity Party of Germany, SED). It was created in 1946
through the Soviet-directed merger of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) and
the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) in the Soviet controlled zone.
Elections took place at the "Volkskammer" but were effectively controlled by
the SED/state hierarchy, as Hans Modrow has noted. Elections were held in less-
than-secret conditions, with voters given the choice of approving or rejecting
"unity lists" put forward by the National Front and predetermining the
distribution of seats given to the different parties and mass organisations. As
was the case in most communist countries, approval rates of 90% or more were
routine. Voting in East Germany was relatively simple. To vote yes, a voter
simply took the ballot paper, which contained only one name‚Äîthat of the
approved candidate‚Äîand dropped it into the voting box. A voter could vote
against the candidate by crossing out his or her name, but had to do so in a
separate voting booth without any secrecy. The consequences for such an act of
defiance were severe‚Äîloss of one's job or expulsion from school, and close
surveillance by the Stasi. The Volkskammer also included representatives from
the "mass organisations" like the Free German Youth ("Freie Deutsche Jugend" or
"FDJ"), or the Free German Trade Union Federation. In an attempt to include
women in the political life of East Germany, there was a Democratic Women's
Federation of Germany, with seats in the Volkskammer. Important non-
parliamentary mass organisations in East German society included the German
Gymnastics and Sports Association ("Deutscher Turn- und Sportbund" or "DTSB"),
and People's Solidarity ("Volkssolidarit√§t", an organisation for the elderly).
Another society of note was the Society for German-Soviet Friendship. Following
German reunification, the SED was renamed the "Party of Democratic Socialism"
(PDS) which subsequently merged with the West German WASG to form the Left
Party ("Die Linke"). The Left Party continues to be a political force in many
parts of Germany, albeit drastically less powerful than the SED. Military.
Every man served eighteen months of compulsory military service; for the
medically unqualified and the conscientious objector, there were the
"Baueinheiten" construction units, established in 1964 in response to political
pressure by the national Protestant Church upon the GDR‚Äôs government. The
armed forces of the GDR also possessed paramilitary reserve forces, such as the
"Kampfgruppen der Arbeiterklasse" (Combat Groups of the Working Class), and
from the Stasi, the Ministry for State Security (Mfs ‚Äî"Ministerium f√ºr
Staatssicherheit"), the ‚Äú"Schild und Schwert der Partei"‚Äù (Shield and Sword
of the Party). Administrative districts. Until 1952, the GDR comprised the East
Berlin capital city and the five German states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (in
1947 renamed: Mecklenburg), Brandenburg, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia, Saxony,
their post-war territorial demarcations approximating the pre-war German
demarcations of the Middle German "L√§nder" (states) and "Provinzen" (provinces
of Prussia). Moreover, the western parts of two provinces, Pomerania and Lower
Silesia, although prevailingly annexed by Poland, remained politically integral
to the GDR. The East German Administrative Reform of 1952 disestablished the
five states and established 14 "Bezirke" (districts), named per their capital
cities: (i) Rostock, (ii) Neubrandenburg, (iii) Schwerin, (iv) Potsdam, (v)
Frankfurt (Oder), (vi) Magdeburg, (vii) Cottbus, (viii) Halle, (ix) Leipzig,
(x) Erfurt, (xi) Dresden, (xii) Karl-Marx-Stadt (Chemnitz until 1953 and again
in 1990), (xiii) Gera, and (xiv) Suhl; East Berlin was denominated a "Bezirk"
(district) in 1961. The disestablished "L√§nder" (states), demarcated as
"Bezirke" (districts), were renamed so: the northern "Land" (state) Mecklenburg
was divided among the "Bezirke" Rostock, Schwerin, and Neubrandenburg;
Brandenburg (containing Berlin) was divided into the Potsdam, Frankfurt (Oder),
and Cottbus districts; Saxony-Anhalt was divided into the Halle and Magdeburg
districts; the south-western state of Thuringia was divided into the Erfurt,
Gera, and Suhl districts; and the south-eastern state of Saxony was divided
among the Leipzig, Dresden, and Karl-Marx-Stadt districts. East Berlin, the
capital city of the German Democratic Republic, formed the "Bezirk" Berlin, the
country‚Äôs fifteenth district, retaining special legal status until 1968, when
the residents voted in approving the new (draft) constitution. Regardless of
the city's four-occupying-power-status, the ACC, and diplomatic objections of
the Allied governments, the GDR administered the "Bezirk" Berlin as sovereign
territory. Population. The East German population declined by three million
people throughout its forty-one year history, from 19 million in 1948 to 16
million in 1990; of the 1948 population, some 4 million were deported from the
lands east of the Oder-Neisse line. This compares starkly with Poland, which
increased during that time from 24 million in 1950 (a little more than East
Germany) to 38 million (more than twice East Germany's population). This was
primarily a result of emigration ‚Äì about one quarter of East Germans left the
country before the Berlin Wall was completed in 1961, and after that time, East
Germany had very low birth rates, except for a recovery in the 1980s when the
birth rate in East Germany was considerably higher than in West Germany, and in
general the birth rate per woman was never much lower than in West Germany,
except during the 1990s. Economy. The East German economy began poorly because
of the devastation caused by the war, the loss of so many young soldiers, the
disruption of business and transportation, the presence of so many refugees,
and finally reparations owed to the USSR. The Red Army dismantled and
transported to Russia the infrastructure and industrial plants of the Soviet
Zone of Occupation. By the early 1950s, the reparations were paid in
agricultural and industrial products; and Lower Silesia, with its coal mines
and Szczecin, an important natural port, were given to Poland by the decision
of Stalin. The socialist centrally planned economy of the German Democratic
Republic was like that of the USSR. In 1950, the GDR joined the COMECON trade
bloc. In 1985, collective (state) enterprises earned 96.7% of the net national
income. To ensure stable prices for goods and services, the state paid 80% of
basic supply costs. The estimated 1984 per capita income was $9,800 ($21,000 in
2008 dollars). In 1976, the average annual growth of the GDP was approximately
five percent. This made East German economy the richest in all of the Soviet
Bloc until 1990 after the Communist collapse in the country. Notable East
German exports were photographic cameras, under the Praktica brand; automobiles
under the Trabant, Wartburg, and the IFA brands; hunting rifles, sextants, and
wristwatches. Until the 1960s, East Germans endured shortages of basic
foodstuffs such as sugar and coffee. East Germans with friends or relatives in
the West (or any access to a hard currency) and the necessary Staatsbank
foreign currency account, could afford Western products and export-quality East
German products via Intershop. Consumer goods also were available, by post,
from the Danish Jauerfood, and Genex companies. The government used money and
prices as political devices, providing highly subsidised prices for a wide
range of basic goods and services, in what was known as "the second pay
packet". The economic results were highly negative, and created an increasing
differential with the prosperity in West Germany. At the production level,
artificial prices made for an inefficient, backward system of semi-barter and
resource-hoarding. For the consumer, it led to the substitution of GDR money
with time, barter, and hard-currencies. Ironically, the socialist economy
became steadily more dependent on financial infusions from hard-currency loans
from West Germany. East Germans, meanwhile, came to see their soft-currency as
worthless relative to the Deutsche Mark (DM). Consumption and jobs. In East
Germany, people who were disgruntled resorted to nasty jokes at the expense of
the oppressive regime; their names were recorded, and too many jokes would land
a man in prison. Throughout its history the main criterion for getting a good
job was unblinking loyalty to the Communist party bosses. Even in the
electronics industry, a relatively modern and competitive sector of the GDR's
economy, the criteria of professionalism were secondary to political criteria
in personnel recruitment and development. Dubious loyalty meant exclusion from
the university and from good jobs. With a very low birth rate and a high rate
of exodus, East Germany was losing workers. The solution was to import low-
skilled workers from other Communist countries. Beginning in 1963 with a series
of secret international agreements, East Germany recruited workers from Poland,
Hungary, Cuba, Albania, Mozambique, Angola and (North) Vietnam. They numbered
more than 100,000 by 1989. Their working conditions were bleak, and although
they were officially equal to their German counterparts, the foreign workers
remained at the bottom of the social ladder with almost no rights. Religion.
Religion was contested ground in the GDR, with the Communists promoting state
atheism, although some people were loyal to Christian communities. Atheism. At
the beginning, the Communist party had asserted the compatibility of
Christianity and Marxism and sought Christian participation in the building of
socialism. At first the question of atheism received little official attention.
In the mid-1950s, as the Cold War heated up, atheism became suddenly a topic of
major interest for the regime for propaganda purposes, both domestic and
foreign. University chairs and departments devoted to the study of 'scientific
atheism' were founded and much literature (scholarly and popular) on the
subject was produced. Then this activity rather quickly subsided in the late
1960s amid perceptions that atheistic propaganda was becoming
counterproductive; but official and scholarly attention to atheism was renewed
beginning in 1973, though this time there was more emphasis on scholarship and
the training of cadre than propaganda. Throughout, attention paid to atheism in
East Germany always reflected politics and was never intended to jeopardise the
cooperation that was desired from those East Germans who were religious.
Protestants. East Germany historically was about 90% Protestant. Between 1956
and 1971 the leadership of the East German Lutheran Church changed its
relations with the state from hostility to cooperation. From the founding of
the GDR in 1949, the Communist Party tried to weaken the influence of the
church on the rising generation. The church therefore adopted an attitude of
confrontation and distance regarding the Communist authorities. Around 1956
this firm stand against the regime began to wither in favour of a more neutral
stance and conditional loyalty. The regime was no longer regarded as
illegitimate; instead, the church leaders started viewing the authorities as
installed by God and, therefore, deserving of obedience by Christians. But on
matters where the state demanded something which was not in accordance with the
will of God, the church reserved its right to say no. There were both
structural and intentional causes behind this development. Structural causes
included the hardening of Cold War tensions in Europe in the mid-1950s, which
took away the temporary character of the East German state. The loss of church
members and discrimination against young Christians also made it clear to the
leaders of the church that they had to come into some kind of dialogue with the
authorities. The intentions behind the change of attitude varied from a
traditional Lutheran acceptance of secular power to a positive attitude toward
socialist ideas. There was also a will to cooperate in order to have the
ability to criticise from within a position of loyalty. Manfred Stolpe (b.
1936) became a lawyer for the Protestant church in 1959 before taking up a
position at church headquarters in Berlin. In 1969 he helped found the Bund der
Evangelischen Kirchen in der DDR, where he negotiated with the Communist
government while at the same time working within the truly democratic system of
the church's institutions. The international outlook he gained through the
church's ecumenical activities helped him in his new job after winning the
regional elections for the state of Brandenburg at the head of the SPD list in
1990. Despite accusations of having colluded with the Communist government,
Stolpe, cleared of the charges, remained at the head of the Brandenburg
government until he joined the federal government in 2002. Catholics. The
smaller Roman Catholic Church had a fully functioning episcopal hierarchy that
was in full accord with the Vatican. During the early postwar years, tensions
were high. The Catholic Church as a whole and particularly the bishops were
resistant to both the regime and Marxist ideology, and the state allowed the
bishops to lodge protests, which they did on issues such as abortion. The
bishops were, however, closely observed by the Stasi. After 1945, the Church
did fairly well in integrating Catholic exiles from lands to the east (which
were given to Poland) and adjusting its institutional structures against the
threats of an atheistic state. Within the Church, this meant an increasingly
hierarchical structure, whereas in the area of religious education, press, and
youth organisations, a system of temporary staff was developed, one that took
into account the special situation of the Caritas, a charity organisation. They
were hardly affected by Communist attempts to force them into line. By 1950,
therefore, there existed a Catholic subsociety that was well adjusted to
prevailing specific conditions and capable of maintaining Catholic identity.
With a generational change in the episcopacy taking place in the early 1980s,
the state hoped for better relations with the new bishops, but the new bishops
instead showed increasing independence from the state by holding unauthorised
mass meetings, promoting international ties in discussions with theologians
abroad, and hosting ecumenical conferences. The new bishops became less
politically oriented and more involved in pastoral care and attention to
spiritual concerns. The government responded by limiting international contacts
for bishops. Culture. East Germany's culture was strongly influenced by
communism and particularly Stalinism and was described by East German
psychoanalyst Hans-Joachim Maaz in 1990 as having produced a "Congested
Feeling" among East Germans as a result of the East German state's goal to
protect people from dangers of deviant cultural influence and dangers of
popular expression deviating from the state's ideals through enforcing official
ideals through physical and psychological repression of these tendencies via
its institutions, particularly the Stasi. Critics of the East German state have
claimed that the state's commitment to communism was a hollow and cynical tool
Machiavellian in nature, but this assertion has been challenged by studies that
have found that the East German leadership was genuinely committed to the
advance of scientific knowledge, economic development, and social progress.
However, Pence and Betts argue, the majority of East Germans over time
increasingly regarded the state's ideals to be hollow, though there was also a
substantial number of East Germans who regarded their culture as having a
healthier, more authentic mentality than that of West Germany. Music. The
Puhdys and Karat were some of the most popular mainstream bands, managing to
hint at critical thoughts in their lyrics without being explicit. Like most
mainstream acts, they appeared in popular youth magazines such as "Neues Leben"
and "Magazin". Other popular rock bands were Wir, Dean Reed, City, Silly and
Pankow. Most of these artists recorded on the state-owned AMIGA label.
Influences from the West were heard because West German TV and radio could be
received in many parts of the East (an exception being Dresden with its
geographical position in the Elbe valley, although limited reception of Western
radio was still possible there). The Western influence led to the formation of
more "underground" groups with a decisively western-oriented sound. A few of
these bands were Die Skeptiker, Die Art and Feeling B. Additionally, hip hop
culture reached the ears of the East German youth. With videos such as "Beat
Street" and "Wild Style", young East Germans were able to develop a hip hop
culture of their own. East Germans accepted hip hop as more than just a music
form. The entire street culture surrounding rap entered the region and became
an outlet for oppressed youth. Dissident singer/songwriter Wolf Biermann,
although professing to be a dedicated Communist, was not permitted to perform
in public, and was deprived of his East German citizenship in 1976, while
visiting West Germany. He was not allowed to return to East Germany until 1989.
Singer Nina Hagen, who is the stepdaughter of Biermann, was exiled at the same
time. Governmental support of classical music maintained some fifty symphony
orchestras, such as Gewandhausorchester and Thomanerchor in Leipzig;
S√§chsische Staatskapelle in Dresden; and Berliner Sinfonie Orchester and
Staatsoper Unter den Linden in Berlin. The birthplace of Johann Sebastian Bach
(1685‚Äì1750), Eisenach, was rendered as a museum about him, featuring more
than three hundred instruments, which, in 1980, received some 70,000 visitors.
In Leipzig, the Bach archive contains his compositions and correspondence and
recordings of his music. Theatre. East German theatre was originally dominated
by Bertolt Brecht, who brought back many artists out of exile and reopened the
"Theater am Schiffbauerdamm" with his Berliner Ensemble. Alternatively, other
influences tried to establish a "Working Class Theatre", played for the working
class by the working class. After Brecht's death, conflicts began to arise
between his family (around Helene Weigel) and other artists about Brecht's
heritage. Heinz Kahlau, Slatan Dudow, Erwin Geschonneck, Erwin Strittmatter,
Peter Hacks, Benno Besson, Peter Palitzsch and Ekkehard Schall were considered
to be among Bertolt Brecht's scholars and followers. In the 1950s the Swiss
director Benno Besson with the Deutsches Theater successfully toured Europe and
Asia including Japan with "The Dragon" by Jewgenij Schwarz. In the 1960s, he
became the Intendant of the Volksb√ºhne often working with Heiner M√ºller.
After 1975 many artists left the GDR because of increasing censorship. A
parallel theatre scene sprung up, creating theatre "outside of Berlin" in which
artists played at provincial theatres. For example Peter Sodann founded the
Neues Theater in Halle/Saale and Frank Castorf at the theater Anklam. Theatre
and cabaret had high status in the GDR, which allowed it to be very pro-active.
This often brought it into confrontation with the state. Benno Besson once
said, "In contrast to artists in the west, they took us seriously, we had a
bearing." Important theatres include: Berliner Ensemble; ‚Äì Deutsches Theater;
Maxim-Gorki-Theater; and Volksb√ºhne Cinema. The prolific cinema of East
Germany was headed by the DEFA, "Deutsche Film AG", which was subdivided in
different local groups, for example "Gruppe Berlin", "Gruppe Babelsberg" or
"Gruppe Johannisthal", where the local teams shot and produced films. Besides
folksy movies, the movie-industry became known worldwide for its productions,
especially children's movies ("Das kalte Herz", film versions of the Brothers
Grimm fairy tales and modern productions such as "Das Schulgespenst"). Frank
Beyer's "Jakob der L√ºgner" (Jacob the Liar), about the Holocaust, and "F√ºnf
Patronenh√ºlsen" (Five Cartridges), about resistance against fascism, became
internationally famous. Films about daily life, such as "Die Legende von Paul
und Paula", by Heiner Carow, and "Solo Sunny", directed by Konrad Wolf and
Wolfgang Kohlhaase, were very popular. The film industry was remarkable for its
production of "Ostern", or Western-like movies. Indians in these films often
took the role of displaced people who fight for their rights, in contrast to
the American westerns of the time, where Indians were often either not
mentioned at all or are portrayed as the villains. Yugoslavians were often cast
as the Indians because of the small number of American Indians in eastern
Europe. Gojko Mitiƒá was well known in these roles, often playing the
righteous, kindhearted and charming chief ("Die S√∂hne der gro√üen B√§rin"
directed by Josef Mach). He became an honorary Sioux chief when he visited the
United States in the 1990s, and the television crew accompanying him showed the
tribe one of his movies. American actor and singer Dean Reed, an expatriate who
lived in East Germany, also starred in several films. These films were part of
the phenomenon of Europe producing alternative films about the colonization of
America. Because of censorship a certain number of very remarkable movies were
forbidden at this time and reissued after the "Wende" in 1990. Examples are
"Spur der Steine" (directed by Frank Beyer) and "Der geteilte Himmel" (directed
by Konrad Wolf). Cinemas in the GDR also showed foreign films. Czechoslovak and
Polish productions were more common, but certain western movies were shown,
though the numbers of these were limited because it cost foreign exchange to
buy the licences. Further, movies representing or glorifying capitalistic
ideology were not bought. Comedies enjoyed great popularity, such as the Danish
"Olsen Gang" or movies with the French comedian Louis de Fun√®s. Since the fall
of the Berlin Wall, several movies depicting life in the GDR have been
critically acclaimed. Some of the most notable were "Good Bye Lenin!" by
Wolfgang Becker, "Das Leben der Anderen" (The Lives of Others) by Florian
Henckel von Donnersmarck (won the Academy Award for best Film in a Foreign
Language) in 2006, "Alles auf Zucker!" (Go for Zucker) by Dani Levi. Each film
is heavily infused with cultural nuances unique to life in the GDR. Sport. East
Germany was very successful in the sports of bicycling, weight-lifting,
swimming, gymnastics, track and field, boxing, ice skating, and winter sports.
The success is attributed to the leadership of Dr. Manfred Hoeppner which
started in the late 1960s. Another supporting reason was doping in East
Germany, especially with anabolic steroids, the most detected doping substances
in IOC-accredited laboratories for many years. The development and
implementation of a state-supported sports doping program helped East Germany,
with its small population, to become a world leader in sport during the 1970s
and 1980s, winning a large number of Olympic and world gold medals and records.
Another factor for success was the furtherance-system for young people in GDR.
Sport-teachers at school were encouraged to look for certain talents in
children ages 6 to 10 years old. For older pupils it was possible to attend
grammar-schools with a focus on sports (for example sailing, football and
swimming). This policy was also used for talented pupils with regard to music
or mathematics. Sports clubs were highly subsidized, especially sports in which
it was possible to get international fame. For example, the major leagues for
ice hockey and basketball just included each 2 teams. Football (soccer) was the
most popular sport. Club football teams such as Dynamo Dresden, 1. FC
Magdeburg, FC Carl Zeiss Jena, 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig and BFC Dynamo had
successes in European competition. Many East German players such as Matthias
Sammer and Ulf Kirsten became integral parts of the reunified national football
team. Other sports enjoyed great popularity like figure skating, especially
because of sportspeople like Katarina Witt. The East and the West also competed
via sport; GDR athletes dominated several Olympic sports. Of special interest
was the only football match between the Federal Republic of Germany and the
German Democratic Republic, a first-round match during the 1974 FIFA World Cup,
which the East won 1‚Äì0; but West Germany, the host, went on to win the World
Cup. Television and radio. Television and radio in East Germany were state
controlled; the "Rundfunk der DDR" was the official radio broadcasting
organisation from 1952 until German reunification. The organization was based
in the "Funkhaus Nalepastra√üe" in East Berlin. "Deutscher Fernsehfunk" (DFF),
from 1972‚Äì1990 known as "Fernsehen der DDR" or DDR-FS, was the state
television broadcaster from 1952. Reception of Western radio (and even
television) broadcasts was widespread. Telecommunications. By the mid-1980s,
East Germany possessed a well-developed communications system. There were
approximately 3.6 million telephones in usage (21.8 for every 100 inhabitants),
and 16,476 Telex stations. Both of these networks were run by the Deutsche Post
der DDR (East German Post Office). East Germany was assigned telephone country
code 37; in 1991, several months after reunification, East German telephone
exchanges were incorporated into country code 49. An unusual feature of the
telephone network was that in most cases, direct dialing for long distance
calls was not possible. Although area codes were assigned to all major towns
and cities, they were only used for switching international calls. Instead,
each location had its own list of dialing codes with shorter codes for local
calls and longer codes for long distance calls. After reunification, the
existing network was largely replaced, and area codes and dialing became
standardised. In 1976 East Germany inaugurated the operation of a ground-based
radio station at F√ºrstenwalde for the purpose of relaying and receiving
communications from Soviet satellites and to serve as a participant in the
international telecommunications organization established by the Soviet
government, Intersputnik. Ostalgie. The end of the Cold War division of Germany
and unification in 1990 inspired initial euphoria. But for many East Germans,
this joy quickly turned to dismay. West Germans often acted as if they had
"won" and East Germans had "lost" in unification, leading many East Germans
("Ossis") to resent West Germans ("Wessis"). Barnstone finds that, "East
Germans resent the wealth possessed by West Germans; West Germans see the East
Germans as lazy opportunists who want something for nothing. East Germans find
‚ÄúWessis‚Äù arrogant and pushy, West Germans think the ‚ÄúOssis‚Äù are lazy
good-for-nothings." Additionally, the dislocations, especially the closure of
obsolete factories in the east, the end of Communism, the disappearance of East
Germany and German unification were hardest for East Germany, where
unemployment skyrocketed and many East German professionals quickly fled for
better jobs in West Germany. These and other effects of unification led many
East Germans to begin to think of themselves more strongly as "East" Germans
rather than as simply as "Germans". In many former GDR citizens this produced a
longing for certain aspects of the former East Germany, such as full employment
and other perceived benefits of the GDR state, termed "Ostalgie" (a blend of
"east" and "nostalgia") and depicted in the Wolfgang Becker film "Goodbye
Lenin!". Danish historian Feiwel Kupferberg (2002) argues that the real
difficulty in German reunification was the sharply different ways the West
Germans and East Germans interpreted their Nazi past. The West Germans
confronted the past and atoned for it, and meanwhile transformed the FRG into a
prosperous, free democracy that expressed the values of both individual freedom
and responsibility. By contrast, the East Germans took hold of Moscow's
official interpretation that East Germany was the "victor of history" and
represented the successful opposition to the Nazis. This myth, Kupferberg
argues, allowed the GDR to attack the West Germans as historically complicit in
the Nazi crimes because it had the same capitalist economy which had produced
Hitler in the first place. East Germany was now pure, because it had rejected
fascism and its twin, capitalism. This attitude, Kupferberg argues, allowed
middle classes that had supported Hitler to often retain powerful roles in East
Germany. Granville concludes that Kupferberg, "articulates well the thesis that
the rigid communist system in the GDR inculcated passivity, helplessness, and
amoral pragmatism in its citizens." See also. Germany Armed Forces Media
