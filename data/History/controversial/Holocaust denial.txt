Holocaust denial Holocaust denial is the act of denying the genocide of Jews in
the Holocaust during World War II. The key claims of Holocaust denial are: the
German Nazi government had no official policy or intention of exterminating
Jews, Nazi authorities did not use extermination camps and gas chambers to mass
murder Jews, and the actual number of Jews killed was significantly (typically
an order of magnitude) lower than the historically accepted figure of 5 to 6
million. Holocaust deniers generally do not accept the term "denial" as an
appropriate description of their activities, and use the term "revisionism"
instead. Scholars use the term "denial" to differentiate Holocaust deniers from
historical revisionists, who use established historical methodologies. The
methodologies of Holocaust deniers are criticized as based on a predetermined
conclusion that ignores extensive historical evidence to the contrary. Most
Holocaust denial claims imply, or openly state, that the Holocaust is a hoax
arising out of a deliberate Jewish conspiracy to advance the interest of Jews
at the expense of other peoples. For this reason, Holocaust denial is generally
considered to be an antisemitic conspiracy theory. Examination of claims.
Holocaust denial is widely viewed as failing to adhere to rules for the
treatment of evidence, principles that mainstream historians (as well as
scholars in other fields) regard as basic to rational inquiry. The Holocaust
was well documented by the bureaucracy of the Nazi government itself. It was
further witnessed by the Allied forces who entered Germany and its associated
Axis states towards the end of World War II. Much of the controversy
surrounding the claims of Holocaust deniers centers on the methods used to
present arguments that the Holocaust allegedly "never happened as commonly
accepted". Numerous accounts have been given by Holocaust deniers (including
evidence presented in court cases) of claimed facts and evidence; however,
independent research has shown these claims to be based upon flawed research,
biased statements, or even deliberately falsified evidence. Opponents of
Holocaust denial have documented numerous instances in which such evidence was
altered or manufactured (see Nizkor Project and David Irving). According to
Pierre Vidal-Naquet, "in our society of image and spectacle, extermination on
paper leads to extermination in reality." Attempts at concealment by
perpetrators. Eisenhower, upon finding the victims of the death camps, ordered
all possible photographs to be taken, and for the German people from
surrounding villages to be ushered through the camps and even made to bury the
dead. He wrote the following to General Marshall after visiting a German
internment camp near Gotha, Germany: History and development after World War
II. After World War II, many of the former leaders of the SS left Germany and
began using their propaganda skills to defend their actions (or, their critics
contended, to rewrite history). Denial materials began to appear shortly after
the war. Harry Elmer Barnes. Harry Elmer Barnes, an American, was at one time a
mainstream historian; he assumed a Holocaust-denial stance in the later years
of his life. Between World War I and World War II, Barnes became well known as
an anti-war writer and a leader in the historical revisionism movement, where
he had worked closely from 1924 onwards with Centre for the Study of the Causes
of the War. This institute was a pseudo-historical think-tank based in Berlin,
secretly funded by the German government and headed by a former "v√∂lkisch"
activist named Major Alfred von Wegerer, whose sole purpose was to prove
Germany was the victim of Allied aggression in 1914. Following World War II,
Barnes became convinced that allegations made against Germany and Japan,
including the Holocaust, were wartime propaganda used to justify U.S.
involvement in World War II. In his 1962 pamphlet, "Revisionism and
Brainwashing", Barnes claimed that there was a ‚Äúlack of any serious
opposition or concerted challenge to the atrocity stories and other modes of
defamation of German national character and conduct‚Äù. Barnes went on to write
that in his view there was ‚Äúa failure to point out the atrocities of the
Allies were more brutal, painful, mortal and numerous than the most extreme
allegations made against the Germans‚Äù. Starting at this time, Barnes started
to cite the French Holocaust denier Paul Rassinier, whom Barnes called a
‚Äúdistinguished French historian‚Äù who Barnes claimed had exposed the
‚Äúexaggerations of the atrocity stories". In a 1964 article entitled
‚ÄúZionist Fraud‚Äù published in the "American Mercury," Barnes wrote that:
Using Rassinier as his source, Barnes claimed that Germany was the victim of
aggression in both 1914 and 1939, and the Holocaust was just propaganda to
justify a war of aggression against Germany. Barnes took the view that World
War II had ended in disaster for the West with Germany divided and the United
States locked into the Cold War, made all the worse in Barnes‚Äôs eyes, as in
his view Germany never wanted war. Barnes claimed that in order to justify the
‚Äúhorrors and evils of the Second World War‚Äù, the Allies were required to
make the Nazis the ‚Äúscapegoat‚Äù for their own misdeeds. Barnes claimed there
were two false claims made about World War II, namely that Germany started the
war in 1939, and the Holocaust, which Barnes denied. Following the example of
Barnes, a few other early libertarian writers also concerned with anti-war
historical revisionism began to take a Holocaust-denial stance, including James
J. Martin. Most libertarians, however‚Äîeven those who otherwise hold Barnes'
writings in high regard‚Äîreject his Holocaust denial. Barnes' name has since
been appropriated by some modern Holocaust deniers in an attempt to lend
credibility to their cause, most notably Willis Carto. The beginnings of the
modern denial movement. In 1961, the American historian and a leading prot√©g√©
of Barnes, David Hoggan published "Der Erzwungene Krieg" ("The Forced War") in
West Germany, which claimed that Germany had been the victim of an Anglo-Polish
conspiracy in 1939. Though "Der Erzwungene Krieg" was primarily concerned with
the origins of World War II, it also down-played or justified the effects of
Nazi antisemitic measures in the pre-1939 period. For an example, Hoggan
justified the huge one billion "Reich"-mark fine imposed on the entire Jewish
community in Germany after the 1938 "Kristallnacht" as a reasonable measure to
prevent what he called "Jewish profiteering" at the expense of German insurance
companies and alleged that no Jews were killed in the "Kristallnacht" (in fact,
91 German Jews were killed in the "Kristallnacht"). Subsequently, Hoggan wrote
one of the first books denying the Holocaust in 1969 entitled "The Myth of the
Six Million", which was published by the Noontide Press, a small Los Angeles
publisher specializing in antisemitic literature. Hoggan became one of the
early stars of the Holocaust denial movement, because he had a number of
university professorships. In 1964, French historian Paul Rassinier published
"The Drama of the European Jews." Rassinier was himself a concentration camp
survivor (imprisoned in Buchenwald for his having helped French Jews escape the
Nazis), and modern-day deniers continue to cite his works as scholarly research
that questions the accepted facts of the Holocaust. Critics argued that
Rassinier did not cite evidence for his claims and ignored information that
contradicted his assertions; he nevertheless remains influential in Holocaust
denial circles for being one of the first deniers to propose that a vast
Zionist/Allied/Soviet conspiracy faked the Holocaust, a theme that would be
picked up in later years by other authors. The publication of Arthur Butz's
"The Hoax of the Twentieth Century: The case against the presumed extermination
of European Jewry" in 1976; and David Irving's "Hitler's War" in 1977 brought
other similarly inclined individuals into the fold. In December 1978 and
January 1979, Robert Faurisson, a French professor of literature at the
University of Lyon, wrote two letters to "Le Monde" claiming that the gas
chambers used by the Nazis to exterminate the Jews did not exist. A colleague
of Faurisson, Jean-Claude Pressac, who initially shared Faurisson's views,
later became convinced of the Holocaust's evidence while investigating
documents at Auschwitz in 1979. He published his conclusions along with much of
the underlying evidence in his 1989 book, "Auschwitz: Technique and operation
of the gas chambers". Henry Bienen, the former president of Northwestern
University, has described Arthur Butz's view of the Holocaust as an
"embarrassment to Northwestern". In 2006, sixty of Butz's colleagues from the
Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science faculty signed a
censure describing Butz's Holocaust denial as "an affront to our humanity and
our standards as scholars". The letter also called for Butz to "leave our
Department and our University and stop trading on our reputation for academic
excellence." Institute for Historical Review. In 1978 Willis Carto founded the
Institute for Historical Review (IHR) as an organization dedicated to publicly
challenging the commonly accepted history of the Holocaust. The IHR sought from
the beginning to attempt to establish itself within the broad tradition of
historical revisionism, by soliciting token supporters who were not from a neo-
Nazi background such as James J. Martin and Samuel Edward Konkin III, and by
promoting the writings of French socialist Paul Rassinier and American anti-war
historian Harry Elmer Barnes to attempt to show that Holocaust denial had a
broader base of support besides just neo-Nazis. The IHR brought most of Barnes'
writings, which had been out of print since his death, back into print. While
IHR included articles on other topics and sold books by mainstream historians
in its catalog, the majority of material published and distributed by IHR was
devoted to questioning the facts surrounding the Holocaust. The IHR became one
of the most important organizations devoted to Holocaust denial. In recent
years the IHR underwent an internal power struggle which ousted Willis Carto
and put Mark Weber in charge. Carto went on to found the "Barnes Review"
magazine after his ouster from IHR, a magazine which is also devoted to
Holocaust denial. Bradley Smith and the Committee for Open Debate on the
Holocaust. In 1987, Bradley R. Smith, a former media director of the Institute
for Historical Review, founded the Committee for Open Debate on the Holocaust
(CODOH). In the United States, CODOH has repeatedly tried to place newspaper
advertisements questioning whether the Holocaust happened, especially in
college campus newspapers. Some newspapers have accepted the advertisements,
while others have rejected them. Bradley Smith has more recently sought other
avenues to promote Holocaust denial¬ ‚Äì with little success. On September 8,
2009, The Harvard Crimson school paper ran a paid ad from Bradley R Smith. It
was quickly criticized and an apology was issued from the editor, claiming it
was a mistake. Bradley referred to his tactics as the CODOH campus project.
Bradley says, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to spend time with adults anymore, I want to go
to students. They are superficial. They are empty vessels to be filled.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat I wanted to do was I wanted to set forth three or four ideas that
students might be interested in, that might cause them to think about things or
to have questions about things. And I wanted to make it as simple as possible,
and to set it up in a way that could not really be debated‚Äù. Holocaust
deniers have placed[‚Ä¶]‚ÄúFull page advertisements in college and university
newspaper, including those of Brandeis University, Boston College, Pennsylvania
State University, and Queens College. Some of these ads arguing that Holocaust
never happened ran without comment; others generated op-ed pieces by professors
and students. James Keegstra. In 1984, James Keegstra, a Canadian high-school
teacher, was charged with denying the Holocaust and making antisemitic claims
in his classroom as part of the course material. Keegstra and his lawyer, Doug
Christie, argued that the section of the Criminal Code of Canada (now section
319{2}), is an infringement of the Charter of Rights (section 9{b}). The case
was appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, where it was decided that the law
he was convicted under did infringe on his freedom of expression, but it was a
justified infringement. Keegstra was convicted, and fired from his job. The
Z√ºndel trials. The Toronto-based photo retoucher Ernst Z√ºndel operated a
small-press publishing house called Samisdat Publishing, which published and
distributed Holocaust-denial material such as "Did Six Million Really Die?" by
Richard Harwood (a.k.a. Richard Verrall¬ ‚Äì a British neo-Nazi leader). In
1985, he was tried in R. v. Zundel and convicted under a "false news" law and
sentenced to 15 months imprisonment by an Ontario court for "disseminating and
publishing material denying the Holocaust." The Holocaust historian Raul
Hilberg was a notable witness for the prosecution at the 1985 trial. Z√ºndel
gained considerable notoriety after this conviction, and a number of free-
speech activists stepped forward to defend his right to publish his opinions.
After his conviction in 1985, Z√ºndel was able to have it overturned in an
appeal on a legal technicality, leading to a second trial in 1988, in which he
was again convicted. The 1988 trial was notable for the appearance of Fred A.
Leuchter, David Irving and Robert Faurisson as defense witnesses for Z√ºndel,
and for the presentation of the pseudo-scientific Leuchter report as a defense
document. The Leuchter report was published in Canada in 1988 by Samisdat
Publishers and in Britain in 1989 by Irving's Focal Point Publishing. In both
of his trials, Z√ºndel was defended by Douglas Christie and Barbara Kulaszka.
His conviction was overturned in 1992 when the Supreme Court of Canada declared
the "false news" law unconstitutional. Z√ºndel has a website, web-mastered by
his wife Ingrid, which publicises his viewpoints. In January 2002, the Canadian
Human Rights Tribunal delivered a ruling in a complaint involving his website,
in which it was found to be contravening the Canadian Human Rights Act. The
court ordered Z√ºndel to cease communicating hate messages. In February 2003,
the American INS arrested him in Tennessee, USA, on an immigration violations
matter, and few days later, Z√ºndel was sent back to Canada, where he tried to
gain refugee status. Z√ºndel remained in prison until March 1, 2005, when he
was deported to Germany and prosecuted for disseminating hate propaganda. On
February 15, 2007, Z√ºndel was convicted on 14 counts of incitement under
Germany's "Volksverhetzung" law, which bans the incitement of hatred against a
portion of the population, and given the maximum sentence of five years in
prison. Ernst Nolte. The German philosopher and historian Ernst Nolte, starting
in the 1980s, advanced a set of theories, which though not denying the
Holocaust appeared to flirt with Holocaust denial as a serious historical
argument. In a letter to the Israeli historian Otto Dov Kulka of December 8,
1986 Nolte criticized the work of the French Holocaust denier Robert Faurisson
on the ground that the Holocaust did occur, but went on to argue that
Faurison‚Äôs work was motivated by what Nolte claimed were the admirable
motives of sympathy towards the Palestinians and opposition to Israel. In his
1987 book "Der europ√§ische B√ºrgerkrieg" ("The European Civil War"), Nolte
claimed that the intentions of Holocaust deniers are "often honourable", and
that some of their claims are "not obviously without foundation". Nolte
himself, though he has never denied the occurrence of the Holocaust, has
claimed that the Wannsee Conference of 1942 never happened, and that the
minutes of the conference were post-war forgeries done by "biased" Jewish
historians designed to discredit Germany The British historian Ian Kershaw has
argued that Nolte was operating on the borderlines of Holocaust denial with his
implied claim that the "negative myth" of the Third Reich was created by Jewish
historians, his allegations of the domination of Holocaust scholarship by
‚Äúbiased‚Äù Jewish historians, and his statements that one should withhold
judgment on Holocaust deniers, whom Nolte takes considerable pains to stress
are not exclusively Germans or fascists. In Kershaw's opinion, Nolte is
attempting to imply that perhaps Holocaust deniers are on to something. In a
1990 interview, Nolte implied that there was something to the Leuchter report:
"If the revisionists deniers and Leuchter among them have made it clear to the
public that even "Auschwitz" must be an object of scientific inquiry and
controversy then they should be given credit for this. Even if it finally
turned out that the number of victims was even greater and the procedures were
even more horrific than has been assumed until now." In his 1993 book
"Streitpunkte" ("Points of Contention"), Nolte praised the work of Holocaust
deniers as superior to "mainstream scholars". Nolte wrote that "radical
revisionists have presented research which, if one is familiar with the source
material and the critique of the sources, is probably superior to that of the
established historians of Germany". In a 1994 interview with "Der Spiegel"
magazine, Nolte stated "I cannot rule out the importance of the investigation
of the gas chambers in which they looked for remnants of the process engendered
by Zyklon B", and that ‚Äú'Of course, I am against revisionists, but Fred
Leuchter's "study" of the Nazi gas ovens has to be given attention, because one
has to stay open to "other" ideas.‚Äù The British historian Richard J. Evans in
his 1989 book "In Hitler's Shadow" expressed the view that Nolte‚Äôs reputation
as a scholar was in ruins as a result of these and other controversial
statements on his part. The American historian Deborah Lipstadt in a 2003
interview stated: The Mayer Controversy. In 1988, the American historian Arno
J. Mayer published a book entitled "Why Did the Heavens Not Darken?", which did
not deny the Holocaust, but appeared to lend support to Holocaust denial by
stating that the majority of people who died at Auschwitz were the victims of
diseases rather than gassing. In addition, critics of Mayer such as Lucy
Dawidowicz assailed him for listing the works of Arthur Butz and Paul Rassinier
in his bibliography, and charged his statements about Auschwitz were factually
incorrect. Holocaust expert Robert Jan van Pelt has noted that Mayer's book is
as close as a mainstream historian has ever come to supporting Holocaust
denial. Holocaust deniers such as David Irving have often cited Mayer‚Äôs book
as one reason for embracing Holocaust denial. Though Mayer has been often
condemned for his statement about the reasons for the Auschwitz death toll, his
book does not deny the Holocaust as Holocaust deniers often claim. Holocaust
deniers have often quoted out of context Mayer‚Äôs sentence in "Why Did the
Heavens Not Darken?" that ‚ÄúSources for the study of the gas chambers at once
rare and unreliable‚Äù as the authors Michael Shermer and Alex Grobman have
noted that the paragraph from which the sentence is taken states that the SS
destroyed the majority of the documention relating to the operation of the gas
chambers in the death camps, which is why Mayer feels that sources for the
operation of the gas chambers are "rare" and "unreliable" The Israeli historian
Yehuda Bauer wrote that Mayer "popularizes the nonsense that the Nazis saw in
Marxism and Bolshevism their main enemy, and the Jews unfortunately got caught
up in this; when he links the destruction of the Jews to the ups and downs of
German warfare in the Soviet Union, in a book that is so cocksure of itself
that it does not need a proper scientific apparatus, he is really engaging in a
much more subtle form of Holocaust denial". Ken McVay and "alt.revisionism".
Ken McVay, an American resident in Canada, was disturbed by the efforts of
organizations like the Simon Wiesenthal Center to suppress the speech of the
Holocaust deniers, feeling that it was better to confront them openly than to
try to censor them. On the Usenet newsgroup "alt.revisionism" he began a
campaign of "truth, fact, and evidence," working with other participants on the
newsgroup to uncover factual information about the Holocaust and counter the
arguments of the deniers by proving them to be based upon misleading evidence,
false statements, and outright lies. He founded the Nizkor Project to expose
the activities of the Holocaust deniers, who responded to McVay with personal
attacks, slander, and death threats. David Irving and the Lipstadt libel case.
Deborah Lipstadt's 1993 book "Denying the Holocaust" was sharply critical of
questionable analytical methods used by various Holocaust deniers, in
particular British author David Irving, whom she accused of deliberately
misrepresenting evidence to justify his preconceived conclusions. In 1996
Irving filed a libel suit against Lipstadt and her publisher, Penguin Books.
American historian Christopher Browning, an expert witness for the defense,
wrote a comprehensive essay for the court summarizing the voluminous evidence
for the reality of the Holocaust, and under cross-examination, effectively
countered all of Irving's principal arguments to the contrary. Cambridge
historian Richard J. Evans, another defense expert witness, spent two years
examining Irving's writings, and confirmed his misrepresentations, including
evidence that he had knowingly used forged documents as source material. The
judge, Justice Charles Gray, ultimately delivered a long and decisive verdict
in favor of Lipstadt that referred to Irving as a "Holocaust denier" and
"right-wing pro-Nazi polemicist." In February 2006 Irving was arrested in
Austria, where Holocaust denial is illegal, for a speech he had made in 1989 in
which he denied the existence of gas chambers at Auschwitz. Irving was aware of
the outstanding arrest warrant, but chose to go to Austria anyway "to give a
lecture to a far-right student fraternity." Although he pleaded guilty to the
charge, Irving said he had been "mistaken", and had changed his opinions on the
Holocaust. "I said that then, based on my knowledge at the time, but by 1991
when I came across the Eichmann papers, I wasn't saying that anymore and I
wouldn't say that now. The Nazis did murder millions of Jews." Irving served 13
months of a 3 year sentence in an Austrian prison, and was deported in early
2007. The episode sparked intense international debate over the limits of
freedom of speech. Upon hearing of Irving's sentence, Lipstadt said, "I am not
happy when censorship wins, and I don't believe in winning battles via
censorship¬ ... The way of fighting Holocaust deniers is with history and with
truth." According to "CNN", upon Irving's return to the UK, he "vow to repeat
views denying the Holocaust that led to his conviction" stating he felt "no
need any longer to show remorse" for his Holocaust views. Recent developments
and trends. In Turkey, in 1996, the Islamic preacher Harun Yahya distributed
thousands of copies of a book which was originally published the previous year,
entitled "Soykƒ±rƒ±m Yalanƒ±" ("The Holocaust Lie") and mailed unsolicited
texts to American and European schools and colleges. The publication of
"Soykƒ±rƒ±m Yalanƒ±" sparked much public debate. This book claims that ‚Äúwhat
is presented as Holocaust is the death of some Jews due to the typhus plague
during the war and the famine towards the end of the war caused by the defeat
of the Germans.‚Äù In March 1996, a Turkish painter and intellectual, Bedri
Baykam, published a strongly worded critique of the book in the Ankara daily
newspaper "Siyah-Beyaz" ("Black and White"). A legal suit for slander was
brought against him. During the trial in September, Baykam exposed the real
author of the book as Adnan Oktar. The suit was withdrawn in March 1997. In
France, Holocaust denial became more prominent in the 1990s as
"n√©gationnisme," though the movement has existed in ultra-left French politics
since at least the 1960s, led by figures such as Pierre Guillaume (who was
involved in the bookshop La Vieille Taupe during the 1960s). Recently, elements
of the extreme far right in France have begun to build on each other's
negationist arguments, which often span beyond the Holocaust to cover a range
of antisemitic views, incorporating attempts to tie the Holocaust to the
Biblical massacre of the Canaanites, critiques of Zionism, and other material
fanning what has been called a "conspiratorial Judeo-phobia" designed to
legitimize and "banalize" antisemitism. In Belgium in 2001, Roeland Raes, the
ideologue and vice-president of one of the country's largest political parties,
the Vlaams Belang (formerly named Vlaams Blok, Flemish Bloc), gave an interview
on Dutch TV where he cast doubt over the number of Jews murdered by the Nazis
during the Holocaust. In the same interview he questioned the scale of the
Nazis' use of gas chambers and the authenticity of Anne Frank's diary. In
response to the media assault following the interview, Raes was forced to
resign his position but vowed to remain active within the party. Three years
later, the Vlaams Blok was convicted of racism and chose to disband.
Immediately afterwards, it legally reformed under the new name Vlaams Belang
(Flemish Interest) with the same leaders and the same membership. Accusations
of a Zionist conspiracy. A different version of this conspiracy theory claims
that Nazis and Zionists had a shared interest or even cooperated in the
extermination of Europe's Jewry, as persecution would force them to flee to
Palestine, then under British Mandate administration. Similar claims are
occasionally heard from Hezbollah. Holocaust denial in the Arab world. Denials
of the Holocaust have been regularly promoted by various Arab leaders and
others and in Arab media throughout the Middle East. According to Associated
Press reports, Arab world attitudes towards the Holocaust range from total
denial to a minimization of the extent of the genocide and holocaust denial is
rife within Palestinian society and in the Palestinian territories. In 2009, a
University of Haifa survey revealed that 40.5 percent of Israeli Arabs claim
the Holocaust never happened. Prominent Arab figures from the Middle East have
rarely made publicized visits to Auschwitz and individuals from the Syrian
government, the Palestinian Authority, and a number of Palestinian groups have
all engaged in various aspects of Holocaust denial. According to Robert Satloff
writing in the Washington Post, "A respected Holocaust research institution
recently reported that Egypt, Qatar and Saudi Arabia all promote Holocaust
denial and protect Holocaust deniers." According to Bernard Lewis, the three
most common positions on the historicity of the Holocaust are: "it never
happened; it was greatly exaggerated; the Jews deserved it anyway. On the last
point, some more enterprising writers add a rebuke to Hitler for not having
finished the job." In August 2002, the Zayed Center for Coordination and
Follow-Up, an Arab League think-tank whose Chairman, Sultan bin Zayed bin
Sultan Al Nahyan, served as Deputy Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates,
promoted a Holocaust denial symposium in Abu Dhabi. The government of the
United Arab Emirates closed down the Zayed Center as a result. Hamas leaders
have also promoted Holocaust denial; Abdel Aziz al-Rantissi held that the
Holocaust never occurred, that Zionists were behind the action of Nazis, and
that Zionists funded Nazism. A press release by Hamas in April 2000 decried
"the so-called Holocaust, which is an alleged and invented story with no
basis." In August 2009, Hamas refused to allow Palestinian children to learn
about the Holocaust, which it called "a lie invented by the Zionists" and
referred to Holocaust education as a "war crime." Holocaust denial has also
been resisted by prominent intellectual figures in the Arab world; in 2001, an
outcry led by Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish, Lebanese writer Elias Khoury
and others brought about the cancellation of a conference the Holocaust denial
organization Institute for Historical Review had planned to hold in Beirut. In
2005 the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood leader, Mohammed Mahdi Akef, denounced
what he called "the myth of the Holocaust" in defending Iranian president
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's denial of the Holocaust. In 2007, the founder of the
Islamic Movement in Israel, Sheikh Abdullah Nimr Darwish, condemned Holocaust
denial in the Muslim world (especially that by Mahmoud Ahmedinejad). Holocaust
denial has been practiced in schools and youth organisations. A private
English-language school in western Beirut censored excerpts of the diary of
Anne Frank out of a school textbook after it caused uproar when Hezbollah
learned the chapter was included in the textbook. The United Nations body
UNESCO stopped funding a children's magazine sponsored by the Palestinian
Authority that commended Hitler's killing of Jews. It deplored this publication
as contrary to its principles of building tolerance and respect for human
rights and human dignity. In a debate which aired on "Al-Alam TV" on May 5,
2010 (as translated by MEMRI), Ali Hatar of the "Jordanian Association against
Zionism and Racism" stated that "To this day, those who claim that Holocaust
did take place have been unable to provide any evidence whatsoever to that
effect." He claimed that a report by the Red Cross in 1949 "refutes the claim
that anyone was killed in these camps, during the so-called Holocaust. It also
mentions the self-management the camps by the Jews." Iranian President
Ahmadinejad. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad frequently denies the
Holocaust, although he has on occasion confirmed his belief in it. Holocaust
denial is relatively new to the Middle East, as Kenneth Jacobson, assistant
national director of the Anti-Defamation League, said in an interview with
"Haaretz": "Adopting the theories of Holocaust denial of Western scholars is a
relatively new phenomenon in the Muslim world. The accepted attitude had been
to say that whereas it was true the Holocaust had taken place, the Palestinians
should not have to pay the price. A look at Iranian President Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad's statements shows that he has mixed the two approaches." In a
December 2005 speech, Ahmadinejad said that a legend was fabricated and had
been promoted to protect Israel. He said, The remarks immediately provoked
international controversy as well as swift condemnation from government
officials in Israel, Europe, and the United States. All six political parties
in the German parliament signed a joint resolution condemning this Holocaust
denial. Hamas political leader Khaled Mashaal described Ahmadinejad's comments
as "courageous" and stated that "Muslim people will defend Iran because it
voices what they have in their hearts, in particular the Palestinian people."
In the United States, the Muslim Public Affairs Council condemned Ahmadinejad's
remarks. On April 24, 2006, Ahmadinejad demanded a free evaluation of the real
extent of the Holocaust "in order to find the ultimate truth." In a May 30,
2006 interview with "Der Spiegel", Ahmadinejad again questioned the Holocaust
several times, insisting there were "two opinions" on it. When asked if the
Holocaust was a myth, he responded "I will only accept something as truth if I
am actually convinced of it". On December 11, 2006, the "International
Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust" opened to widespread
condemnation. The conference, called for by and held at the behest of
Ahmadinejad, was widely described as a "Holocaust denial conference" or a
"meeting of Holocaust deniers", though Iran denied it was a Holocaust denial
conference. A few months before it opened, the Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi stated: "The Holocaust is not a sacred issue that
one can't touch. I have visited the Nazi camps in Eastern Europe. I think it is
exaggerated." Mir-Hossein Mousavi is the former Prime minister of Iran and an
opposition leader. During a TV-debate preceding Iran's 2009 elections, the
Jerusalem Post reported that Mousavi "slam Ahmadinejad's Holocaust denial". He
also said that it had cost Iran its international standing. According to Press
TV, Mousavi has said that the Holocaust is not Iran's business, and that Iran
should instead try to "find the most reasonable way to solve the Palestine
case". In early June 2009, Ahmadinejad described Israel as "the most criminal
regime in human history" and spoke about the "great deception of the Holocaust"
in a speech quoted by IRIB. At the September 2009 Quds Day ceremonies in
Tehran, Ahmadinejad stated Israel was created on "a lie and a mythical claim,"
that the Western powers "launched the myth of the Holocaust. They lied, they
put on a show and then they support the Jews" ‚Äì what the "New York Times"
considered his "among his harshest statements on the topic," and one
immediately condemned by the US, UK, French and German governments. In
September 2010, during a State visit to New York City, Ahmadinejad once again
questioned the Holocaust, saying it ‚Äúhas been exaggerated as a pretext for
war.‚Äù In an interview with the editor of the magazine "Atlantic Monthly" on
September¬ 28, he said, ‚ÄúThe question is, why don't we allow this subject to
be examined further ... It is incorrect to force only one view on the rest of
the world.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúHow come when it comes to the subject of the
Holocaust there is so much sensitivity?‚Äù Ahmadinejad made similar statements
later that day during what was described by Agence France-Presse as a
‚Äúchaotic speech‚Äù at the United Nations summit on the Millennium Development
Goals. He further charged that the U.S. government "orchestrated" the World
Trade Center attacks in order to reverse declines in the U.S. economy and "save
the Zionist regime." He broke off at one point during the speech to complain
that his words were not being accurately translated. (Organizers said they were
translating from a prepared text submitted by the Iranian delegation.)
Ahmadinejad was praised by Syrian Author Muhammad Nimr Al-Madani (author of
""Were the Jews Burned in the Ovens?", Beirut: Al-Manara, 2001), who has
previously claimed that "Hitler Was Falsely Accused of Committing Genocide
against the Jews". In an interview on "Al-Alam TV" (Iran), Al-Madani stated
that "I was very happy when the Iranian president denied the Holocaust. Since I
am convinced of the need to fight this lie, I was filled with admiration at the
words of the Iranian president" and that "those who claim that the Holocaust
took place do not have any proof." He also praised Ahmadinejad as "the first
leader in the world to adopt Holocaust denial. This is a great event."
Propaganda in the media. According to James Najarian, Holocaust deniers working
for the Institute for Historical review are not trained in history and "put out
sham scholarly articles in the mock-academic publication, the "Journal of
Historical Review"". They appeal to ‚Äúour objectivity, our sense of fair play,
and our distrust of figurative language‚Äù. Thus, they rely on facts to grab
the readers‚Äô attention. These facts, however, are strung by what Narjarian
calls ‚Äúfabricated decorum‚Äù and are re-interpreted for their use. For
example, they pay particular attention to inconsistencies in numbers. Holocaust
denial propaganda in all forms has shown to influence the audiences that it
reaches. In fact, even the well-educated‚Äîthat is, college graduates and
current university students alike‚Äîare susceptible to such propaganda when it
is presented before them. This stems from the growing disbelief that audiences
feel after being exposed to such information, especially since Holocaust
witnesses themselves are decreasing in number. Studies centered on the
psychological effects of Holocaust denial propaganda confirm this assertion.
Linda M. Yelland and William F. Stone, in particular, show that Denial essays
decrease readers‚Äô belief in the Holocaust, regardless of their prior
Holocaust awareness. Reactions to Holocaust denial. Types of reaction.
Scholarly response to Holocaust denial can be roughly divided into three
categories: Some academics refuse to engage Holocaust deniers or their
arguments at all, on grounds that doing so lends them unwarranted legitimacy. A
second group of scholars, typified by the American historian Deborah Lipstadt,
have tried to raise awareness of the methods and motivations of Holocaust
denial without legitimizing the deniers themselves. "We need not waste time or
effort answering the deniers' contentions," Lipstadt wrote. "It would be never-
ending¬ ... Their commitment is to an ideology and their 'findings' are shaped
to support it." A third group, typified by the Nizkor Project, responds to
arguments and claims made by Holocaust denial groups by pointing out
inaccuracies and errors in their evidence. Even scholarly responses, however,
can trigger vigorous rebuttals. In 1996, the British historian David Irving
brought a civil defamation suit against Lipstadt and her publisher, stemming
from Lipstadt's book "Denying the Holocaust", in which she named Irving as "one
of the more dangerous" Holocaust deniers, because he was a published author,
and was viewed by some as a legitimate military historian. He was "familiar
with historical evidence," she wrote, and "bends it until it conforms with his
ideological leanings and political agenda." Irving, who appeared as a defense
witness in Ernst Z√ºndel's trial in Canada, and once declared at a rally of
Holocaust deniers that "more women died in the back seat of Edward Kennedy's
car than ever died in a gas chamber at Auschwitz", claimed that Lipstadt's
allegation damaged his reputation. After a two-month trial in London, the trial
judge issued a 333-page ruling against Irving. Public figures and scholars. A
number of public figures and scholars have spoken out against Holocaust denial.
The American Historical Association, the oldest and largest society of
historians and teachers of history in the United States, states that Holocaust
denial is "at best, a form of academic fraud." Dr. William Shulman, director of
the Holocaust Research Center, described the denial "as if these people the
Holocaust were killed twice", a sentiment echoed by literary theorist Jean
Baudrillard, who argued that "Forgetting the extermination is part of the
extermination itself." In 2006, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said:
"Remembering is a necessary rebuke to those who say the Holocaust never
happened or has been exaggerated. Holocaust denial is the work of bigots; we
must reject their false claims whenever, wherever and by whomever they are
made." Holocaust survivor and Nobel Prize winner Elie Wiesel calls the
Holocaust "the most documented tragedy in recorded history. Never before has a
tragedy elicited so much witness from the killers, from the victims and even
from the bystanders‚Äîmillions of pieces here in the museum what you have, all
other museums, archives in the thousands, in the millions." He made a similar
statement on a special edition of "The Oprah Winfrey Show" after his final trip
to Auschwitz, along with host Winfrey. In January 2007, the United Nations
General Assembly condemned "without reservation any denial of the Holocaust",
though Iran disassociated itself from the resolution. Holocaust denial and
antisemitism. Holocaust denial is generally viewed as antisemitic. The
"Encyclopedia of Genocide and Crimes Against Humanity", for example, defines
Holocaust denial as "a new form of anti-Semitism, but one that hinges on age-
old motifs". The Anti-Defamation League has stated that "Holocaust denial is a
contemporary form of the classic anti-Semitic doctrine of the evil,
manipulative and threatening world Jewish conspiracy" and French historian
Val√©rie Igounet has written that "Holocaust denial is a convenient polemical
substitute for anti-semitism." In 2005, the European Monitoring Centre on
Racism and Xenophobia (now the Fundamental Rights Agency) published a "working
definition" of antisemitism which gave as an example of the way that
antisemitism might manifest itself, "denying the fact, scope, mechanisms (e.g.
gas chambers) or intentionality of the genocide of the Jewish people at the
hands of National Socialist Germany and its supporters and accomplices during
World War II (the Holocaust)". In a defense of Holocaust denier Bishop Richard
Williamson against the charge of being antisemitic, the journalist and writer
Kevin Myers argued "It is not anti-Semitic to make a fool of yourself in public
about a historical fact. It is anti-Semitic to preach or promote a dislike of
Jews because they are Jews, which is what Bishop Williamson has not done." Laws
against Holocaust denial. Holocaust denial is explicitly or implicitly illegal
in 17 countries: Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, France, Germany,
Hungary, Israel, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Poland,
Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, and Switzerland. The European Union's Framework
decision on Racism and Xenophobia states that denying or grossly trivializing
"crimes of genocide" should be made "punishable in all EU Member States".
Slovakia criminalized denial of fascist crimes in general in late 2001; in May
2005, the term "Holocaust" was explicitly adopted by the penal code and in
2009, it became illegal to deny any act regarded by an international criminal
court as genocide. The Parliament of Hungary adopted the most recent
legislation, which declared denial or trivialization of the Holocaust a crime
punishable by up to three years imprisonment, in February 2010. Such
legislation remains controversial. In October 2007, a tribunal declared Spain's
Holocaust denial law unconstitutional. In 2007 Italy rejected a denial law
proposing a prison sentence of up to four years. In 2006 the Netherlands
rejected a draft law proposing a maximum sentence of one year on denial of
genocidal acts in general, although specifically denying the Holocaust remains
a criminal offense there. The United Kingdom has twice rejected Holocaust
denial laws. Denmark and Sweden have also rejected such legislation. A number
of deniers have been prosecuted under various countries' denial laws. French
literature professor Robert Faurisson, for example, was convicted and punished
under the Gayssot Act in 1990. Some historians oppose such laws, among them
Vidal-Naquet, an outspoken critic of Faurisson, on the grounds that denial
legislation imposes "historical truth as legal truth." Other academics favor
criminalization. Holocaust denial, they contend, is "the worst form of racism
and its most respectable version because it pretends to be a research." In the
Belgian Senate the Minister of Justice Laurette Onkelinx compared laws
criminalizing Holocaust denial with those condemning incitement to ethnic or
racial hatred in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Focus on Allied war
crimes in Holocaust denial literature. The focus on supposed Allied atrocities
during the war has also been a theme in Holocaust denial literature,
particularly in countries where outright denial of the Holocaust is illegal.
According to historian Deborah Lipstadt, the concept of "comparable Allied
wrongs" such as the post-war expulsions and alleged Allied war crimes like the
bombing of Dresden, is at the center of, and a continuously repeated theme of,
contemporary Holocaust denial; phenomenon she calls "immoral equivalencies".
Pierre Vidal-Naquet pointed out the same phenomenon in the earlier version of
"Les Assassins de la m√©moire" under the title "Auschwitz et le tiers monde"
("Les Assassins de la m√©moire", Paris, 2005, pp.¬ 170‚Äì180), and accurately
about the declarations of Klaus Barbie's lawyer Jacques Verg√®s. In 1977,
Martin Broszat in a review of David Irving's book "Hitler's War" maintained
that the picture of World War II drawn by Irving was done in a such way to
imply moral equivalence between the actions of the Axis and Allied states with
both sides equally guilty of terrible crimes, leading to Hitler's "fanatical,
destructive will to annihilate" being downgraded to being "no longer an
exceptional phenomenon". Other genocide denials. Other acts of genocide have
met similar attempts to deny and minimize. Gregory H. Stanton, formerly of the
US State Department and the founder of Genocide Watch, lists denial as the
final stage of a genocide development: "Denial is the eighth stage that always
follows a genocide. It is among the surest indicators of further genocidal
massacres. The perpetrators of genocide dig up the mass graves, burn the
bodies, try to cover up the evidence and intimidate the witnesses. They deny
that they committed any crimes, and often blame what happened on the victims."
