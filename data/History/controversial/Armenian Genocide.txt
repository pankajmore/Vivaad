Armenian Genocide The Armenian Genocide (, ), also known as the Armenian
Holocaust, the Armenian Massacres and, traditionally among Armenians, as the
Great Crime (, ; English transliteration: Medz Yeghern + Yeghern/Crime) was the
Ottoman government's systematic extermination of its minority Armenian subjects
from their historic homeland in the territory constituting the present-day
Republic of Turkey. It took place during and after World War I and was
implemented in two phases: the wholesale killing of the able-bodied male
population through massacre and forced labor, and the deportation of women,
children, the elderly and infirm on death marches to the Syrian Desert . The
total number of people killed as a result has been estimated at between 1 and
1.5 million. The Assyrians, the Greeks and other minority groups were similarly
targeted for extermination by the Ottoman government, and their treatment is
considered by many historians to be part of the same genocidal policy. It is
acknowledged to have been one of the first modern genocides, as scholars point
to the organized manner in which the killings were carried out to eliminate the
Armenians, and it is the second most-studied case of genocide after the
Holocaust. The word "genocide" was coined in order to describe these events.
The starting date of the genocide is conventionally held to be April 24, 1915,
the day when Ottoman authorities arrested some 250 Armenian intellectuals and
community leaders in Constantinople. Thereafter, the Ottoman military uprooted
Armenians from their homes and forced them to march for hundreds of miles,
depriving them of food and water, to the desert of what is now Syria. Massacres
were indiscriminate of age or gender, with rape and other sexual abuse
commonplace. The majority of Armenian diaspora communities were founded as a
result of the Armenian genocide. The Republic of Turkey, the successor state of
the Ottoman Empire, denies the word "genocide" is an accurate description of
the events. In recent years, it has faced repeated calls to accept the events
as genocide. To date, twenty countries have officially recognized the events of
the period as genocide, and most genocide scholars and historians accept this
view. Background. Life under Ottoman rule. Armenia had come largely under
Ottoman rule during the 15th and 16th centuries. The vast majority of
Armenians, grouped together under the name Armenian "millet" (community) and
led by their spiritual head, the Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople, were
concentrated in the eastern provinces of the Ottoman Empire (commonly referred
to as Western Armenia), although large communities were also found in the
western provinces, as well as in the capital Constantinople. The Armenian
community was made up of three religious denominations: the Armenian Apostolic
to which the overwhelming majority of Armenians belonged, and the Armenian
Catholic and Armenian Protestant communities. With the exception of the
empire's urban centers and the extremely wealthy, Constantinople-based "Amira"
class, a social elite whose members included the Duzians (Directors of the
Imperial Mint), the Balyans (Chief Imperial Architects) and the Dadians
(Superintendent of the Gunpowder Mills and manager of industrial factories),
most Armenians â€” approximately 70% of their population â€” lived in poor and
dangerous conditions in the rural countryside. In addition to other legal
limitations, Christians were not considered equals to Muslims: testimony
against Muslims by Christians and Jews was inadmissible in courts of law; they
were forbidden to carry weapons or ride atop horses; their houses could not
overlook those of Muslims; and their religious practices were severely
circumscribed (e.g., the ringing of church bells was strictly forbidden).
Violation of these statutes could result in punishments ranging from the
levying of exorbitant fines to execution. Reform implementation, 1840sâ€“80s.
Beginning in the mid-19th century, the three major European powers, Great
Britain, France and Russia (known as the Great Powers), took issue with the
Empire's treatment of its Christian minorities and increasingly pressured the
Ottoman government (known as the Sublime Porte) to extend equal rights to all
its citizens. Starting in 1839 and ending with the declaration of a
constitution in 1876, the Ottoman government implemented a series of reforms,
known as the Tanzimat, to improve the situation of minorities, although these
were all largely abortive. The Muslims of the empire were loath to consider the
Christians as their social equals. By the late 1870s, the Greeks, along with
several other Christian nations in the Balkans, frustrated with their
conditions, had, often with the help of the Powers, broken free of Ottoman
rule. The Armenians remained, by and large, passive during these years, earning
them the title of "millet-i sadika" or the "loyal millet." In the mid-1860s and
early 1870s, things began to change as an intellectual class began to emerge
among Armenian society. Educated in the European university system or in
American missionary schools in the Ottoman Empire, these Armenians began to
question their second-class status in society and initiated a movement that
asked for better treatment from their government. In one such instance, after
amassing the signatures of peasants from Western Armenia, the Armenian Communal
Council petitioned to the Ottoman government to redress the issues that the
peasants complained about the most: "the looting and murder in Armenian towns
by Kurds and Circassians, improprieties during tax collection, criminal
behavior by government officials and the refusal to accept Christians as
witnesses in trial." The Ottoman government considered these grievances and
promised to punish those responsible, though no meaningful steps were ever
taken. Following the violent suppression of Christians in the uprisings in
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria and Serbia in 1875, the Great Powers invoked
the 1856 Treaty of Paris by claiming that it gave them the right to intervene
and protect the Ottoman Empire's Christian minorities. Under growing pressure,
the government of Sultan Abdul Hamid II declared itself a constitutional
monarchy with a parliament (which was almost immediately prorogued) and entered
into negotiations with the powers. At the same time, the Armenian patriarchate
of Constantinople, Nerses II, forwarded Armenian complaints of widespread
"forced land seizureâ€¦ forced conversion of women and children, arson,
protection extortion, rape, and murder" to the Powers. After the conclusion of
the 1877â€“78 Russo-Turkish War, the Armenians began to look more toward the
Russian Empire as the ultimate guarantors of their security. Nerses approached
the Russian leadership during its negotiations with the Ottomans in San Stefano
and in the eponymous treaty, convinced them to insert a clause, Article 16,
stipulating that the Russian forces occupying the Armenian-populated provinces
in the eastern Ottoman Empire would withdraw only with the full implementation
of reforms. Great Britain was troubled with Russia's holding on to so much
Ottoman territory and forced it to enter into new negotiations with the
convening of the Congress of Berlin in June 1878. Armenians also entered into
these negotiations and emphasized that they sought autonomy, not independence
from the Ottoman Empire. They partially succeeded, as Article 61 of the Treaty
of Berlin contained the same text as Article 16 but removed any mention that
Russian forces would remain in the provinces; instead, the Ottoman government
was periodically to inform the Great Powers of the progress of the reforms.
Armenian revolutionary movement. As it turned out, the reforms were not
forthcoming. Upset with this turn of events, a number of disillusioned Armenian
intellectuals living in Europe and Russia decided to form political parties and
societies dedicated to the betterment of their compatriots living inside the
Ottoman Empire. In the last quarter of the 19th century, this movement came to
be dominated by three parties: the Ramkavar (Constitutional-Democrat;
Armenakan), Social Democrat Hunchakian Party, and the Armenian Revolutionary
Federation (Dashnaktsutiun). While the parties differed somewhat in ideology,
they were all committed to the same goal of seeing the social status of
Armenians in the Ottoman Empire improve. Parallel to their efforts, another
group of Armenians, seeing the futility of asking for reforms and the
unwillingness of the European powers in pressuring the Ottoman government to
implement reforms, were convinced that the only possibility of improving the
plight of the Armenians was through self-defense. Hamidian Massacres,
1894â€“96. Since 1876, the Ottoman state had been led by Sultan Abdul Hamid II.
From the beginning of the reform period after the signing of the Berlin treaty,
Hamid II attempted to stall their implementation and asserted that Armenians
did not make up a majority in the provinces and that Armenian reports of abuses
were largely exaggerated or false. In 1890, Hamid II created a paramilitary
outfit known as the "Hamidiye" which was made up of Kurdish irregulars who were
tasked to "deal with the Armenians as they wished." As Ottoman officials
intentionally provoked rebellions (often as a result of over-taxation) in
Armenian populated towns, such as in Sasun in 1894 and Zeitun in 1895â€“96,
these regiments were increasingly used to deal with the Armenians by way of
oppression and massacre. In some instances, Armenians successfully fought off
the regiments and brought the excesses to the attention of the Great Powers in
1895 who subsequently condemned the Porte. The Powers forced Hamid to sign a
new reform package designed to curtail the powers of the "Hamidiye" in October
1895 which, like the Berlin treaty, was never implemented. On October 1, 1895,
2,000 Armenians assembled in Constantinople to petition for the implementation
of the reforms but Ottoman police units converged towards the rally and
violently broke it up. Soon, massacres of Armenians broke out in Constantinople
and then engulfed the rest of the Armenian-populated provinces of Bitlis,
Diyarbekir, Erzerum, Harput, Sivas, Trabzon and Van. Estimates differ on how
many Armenians were killed but European documentation of the violence, which
became known as the Hamidian massacres, placed the figures from anywhere
between 100â€“300,000Â Armenians. Although Hamid was never directly implicated
in ordering the massacres, it is believed that they had his tacit encouragement
approval. Frustrated with European indifference to the massacres, Armenians
from the Dashnaktsutiun party seized the European-managed Ottoman Bank on
August 26, 1896. This incident brought further sympathy for Armenians in Europe
and was lauded by the European and American press, which vilified Hamid and
painted him as the "great assassin" and "bloody Sultan." While the Great Powers
vowed to take action and enforce new reforms, these never came into fruition
due to conflicting political and economic interests. Prelude to genocide. The
Young Turk Revolution of 1908. On July 24, 1908, Armenians' hopes for equality
in the empire brightened once more when a coup d'Ã©tat staged by officers in
the Turkish Third Army based in Salonika removed Abdul Hamid from power and
restored the country to a constitutional monarchy. The officers were part of
the Young Turk movement that wanted to reform administration of the decadent
state of the Ottoman Empire and modernize it to European standards. The
movement was an anti-Hamidian coalition made up of two distinct groups: the
secular liberal constitutionalists and the nationalists; the former was more
democratic and accepted Armenians into their wing whereas the latter was more
intolerant in regard to Armenian-related issues and their frequent requests for
European assistance. In 1902, during a congress of the Young Turks held in
Paris, the heads of the liberal wing, Sabahaddin and Ahmed Riza Bey, partially
persuaded the nationalists to include in their objectives to ensure some rights
to all the minorities of the empire. One of the numerous factions within the
Young Turk movement was a secret revolutionary organization called The
Committee of Union and Progress. It drew its proliferating membership from
disaffected army officers based in Salonika and was behind a wave of mutinies
against the central government. In 1908, elements of the Third Army and the
Second Army Corps declared their opposition to the Sultan and threatened to
march on the capital to depose him. Hamid, shaken by the wave of resentment,
stepped down from power as Armenians, Greeks, Arabs, Bulgarians and Turks alike
rejoiced in his dethronement. The Adana Massacre of 1909. A countercoup took
place on April 13, 1909. Some Ottoman military elements, joined by Islamic
theological students, aimed to return control of the country to the Sultan and
the rule of Islamic law. Riots and fighting broke out between the reactionary
forces and CUP forces, until the CUP was able to put down the uprising and
court-martial the opposition leaders. While the movement initially targeted the
Young Turk government, it spilled over into pogroms against Armenians who were
perceived as having supported the restoration of the constitution. When Ottoman
Army troops were called in, many accounts record that instead of trying to
quell the violence they actually took part in pillaging Armenian enclaves in
Adana province. 15,000â€“30,000Â Armenians were killed in the course of the
"Adana Massacre". The Balkan wars. In 1912, the First Balkan War broke out and
resulted in a defeat of the Ottoman Empire and the loss of 85% of its territory
in Europe. Many in the empire saw their defeat as "Allah's divine punishment
for a society that did not know how to pull itself together." The Turkish
nationalist movement in the country gradually came to view Anatolia as their
last refuge. That the Armenian population formed a significant minority in this
region would figure prominently in the calculations of the Young Turks who
would eventually carry out the Armenian Genocide. An important consequence of
the Balkan Wars was also the mass expulsion of Muslims (known as "muhajirs")
from the Balkans. In fact, beginning in the mid-19th century, hundreds of
thousands of Muslims, including Circassians and Chechens, were expelled or
forced to flee from the Caucasus and the Balkans (Rumelia) as a result of the
Russo-Turkish wars and the conflicts in the Balkans. Muslim society in the
empire was incensed by this flood of refugees and overcome by a sense of
revenge. A journal published in Constantinople expressed the mood of the times:
"Let this be a warning...O Muslims, don't get comfortable! Do not let your
blood cool before taking revenge." As many as 850,000 of these refugees were
settled in areas where the Armenians were resident from the period of
1878â€“1904. The "muhajirs" resented the status of their relatively well-off
neighbors and, as historian Taner AkÃ§am and others have noted, the refugees
would come to play a pivotal role in the killings of the Armenians and the
confiscation of their properties during the genocide. World War I. On November
2, 1914, the Ottoman Empire entered World War I on the side of the Central
Powers. The Middle Eastern theatre of World War I became the scene of action.
The combatants were the Ottoman Empire, with some assistance from the other
Central Powers, and primarily the British and the Russians among the Allies of
World War I. The conflicts at the Caucasus Campaign, the Persian Campaign and
the Gallipoli Campaign affected where the Armenian people lived in significant
amounts. Before the declaration of war at the Armenian congress at Erzurum the
Ottoman government requested the Ottoman Armenians to facilitate the conquest
of Transcaucasia by inciting a rebellion with the Russian Armenians against the
tsarist army in the event of a Caucasus front. Battle of Sarikamish. On
December 24, 1914 Minister of War Enver Pasha developed a plan to encircle and
destroy the Russian Caucasus Army at Sarikamish, to regain territories lost to
Russia after the Russo-Turkish War of 1877â€“78. Enver Pasha's forces were
routed at the Battle of Sarikamis, and almost completely destroyed. In the
summer of 1914, Armenian volunteer units were established under the Russian
Armed forces. As the Russian Armenian conscripts had already been sent to the
European Front, this force was uniquely established from Armenians that were
not Russian or who were not obligated to serve. An Ottoman representative,
Karekin Bastermadjian (Armen Karo), was also brought into to this force.
Initially they had 20,000 men, but it was reported that their number
subsequently increased. Returning to Constantinople, Enver publicly blamed his
defeat on Armenians in the region having actively sided with the Russians.
Labor battalions, February 25. On February 25, 1915, The War minister Enver
Pasha sent an order to all military units that Armenians in the active Ottoman
forces be demobilized and assigned to the unarmed Labour battalion (Turkish:
"amele taburlari"). Enver Pasha explained this decision as "out of fear that
they would collaborate with the Russians". As a tradition, the Ottoman Army
drafted non-Muslim males only between the ages of 20 and 45 into the regular
army. The younger (15â€“20) and older (45â€“60) non-Muslim soldiers had always
been used as logistical support through the labor battalions. Before February,
some of the Armenian recruits were utilized as laborers ("hamals"), though they
would ultimately be executed. Transferring Armenian conscripts from active
field (armed) to passive, unarmed logistic section was an important aspect of
the subsequent genocide. As reported in "The Memoirs of Naim Bey", the
extermination of the Armenians in these battalions was part of a premeditated
strategy on behalf of the Committee of Union and Progress. Many of these
Armenian recruits were executed by local Turkish gangs. Events at Van, April
1915. On April 19, 1915, Jevdet Bey demanded that the city of Van immediately
furnish him 4,000Â soldiers under the pretext of conscription. However, it was
clear to the Armenian population that his goal was to massacre the able-bodied
men of Van so that there would be no defenders. Jevdet Bey had already used his
official writ in nearby villages, ostensibly to search for arms, but in fact to
initiate wholesale massacres. The Armenians offered five hundred soldiers and
exemption money for the rest in order to buy time, but Djevdet accused
Armenians of "rebellion" and asserted his determination to "crush" it at any
cost. "If the rebels fire a single shot", he declared, "I shall kill every
Christian man, woman, and" (pointing to his knee) "every child, up to here." On
April 20, 1915, the armed conflict of the Siege of Van began when an Armenian
woman was harassed and the two Armenian men that came to her aid were killed by
Ottoman soldiers. The Armenian defenders protected 30,000Â residents and
15,000Â refugees in an area of roughly one square kilometer of the Armenian
Quarter and suburb of Aigestan with 1,500Â ablebodied riflemen who were
supplied with 300Â rifles and 1,000Â pistols and antique weapons. The conflict
lasted until General Yudenich came to rescue them. Similar reports reached
Morgenthau from Aleppo and Van, prompting him to raise the issue in person with
Talaat and Enver. As he quoted to them the testimonies of his consulate
officials, they justified the deportations as necessary to the conduct of the
war, suggesting that complicity of the Armenians of Van with the Russian forces
that had taken the city justified the persecution of all ethnic Armenians.
Arrest and deportation of Armenian notables, April 1915. On April 24, 1915, Red
Sunday (), was the night on which the leaders of Armenians of the Ottoman
capital, Constantinople, and later extending to other Ottoman centers were
arrested and moved to two holding centers near Ankara by then minister of
interior Mehmed Talaat Bey with his . These Armenians were later deported with
the passage of Tehcir Law on 29 May 1915. The date 24 April, Genocide
Remembrance Day, commemorates the Armenian notables deported from the Ottoman
capital in 1915, as the precursor to the ensuing events. On the night of April
24, 1915, the Ottoman government rounded up and imprisoned an estimated 250
Armenian intellectuals and community leaders. This date coincided with Allied
troop landings at Gallipoli after unsuccessful Allied naval attempts to break
through the Dardanelles to Constantinople in February and March 1915. Triple
Entente's reaction. On May 24, 1915, the Triple Entente warned the Ottoman
Empire that "In view of these new crimes of Turkey against humanity and
civilization, the Allied Governments announce publicly to the Sublime Porte
that they will hold personally responsible for these crimes all members of the
Ottoman Government, as well as those of their agents who are implicated in such
massacres." Massacres. Mass burnings. Eitan Belkind was a Nili member, who
infiltrated the Ottoman army as an official. He was assigned to the
headquarters of Kamal Pasha. He claims to have witnessed the burning of 5,000
Armenians. Lt. Hasan Maruf, of the Ottoman army, describes how a population of
a village were taken all together, and then burned. The Commander of the Third
Army Vehib's 12-page affidavit, which was dated 5 December 1918, was presented
in the Trabzon trial series (March 29, 1919) included in the Key Indictment,
reporting such a mass burning of the population of an entire village near Mush.
that in Bitlis, Mus and Sassoun, "The shortest method for disposing of the
women and children concentrated in the various camps was to burn them." And
also that "Turkish prisoners who had apparently witnessed some of these scenes
were horrified and maddened at remembering the sight. They told the Russians
that the stench of the burning human flesh permeated the air for many days
after." Drowning. Trabzon was the main city in Trabzon province; Oscar S.
Heizer, the American consul at Trabzon, reports: "This plan did not suit Nail
Bey... Many of the children were loaded into boats and taken out to sea and
thrown overboard." The Italian consul of Trabzon in 1915, Giacomo Gorrini,
writes: "I saw thousands of innocent women and children placed on boats which
were capsized in the Black Sea." The Trabzon trials reported Armenians having
been drowned in the Black Sea. Hoffman Philip, the American Charge at
Constantinople chargÃ© d'affaires, writes: "Boat loads sent from Zor down the
river arrived at Ana, one thirty miles away, with three fifths of passengers
missing." Use of poison and drug overdoses. The psychiatrist Robert Jay Lifton
writes in a parenthesis when introducing the crimes of Nazi doctors, "Perhaps
Turkish doctors, in their participation in the genocide against the Armenians,
come closest, as I shall later suggest." Morphine overdose: During the Trabzon
trial series of the Martial court, from the sittings between March 26 and May
17, 1919, the Trabzons Health Services Inspector Dr. Ziya Fuad wrote in a
report that Dr. Saib caused the death of children with the injection of
morphine. The information was allegedly provided by two physicians (Drs. Ragib
and Vehib), both Dr. Saib's colleagues at Trabzons Red Crescent hospital, where
those atrocities were said to have been committed. Toxic gas: Dr. Ziya Fuad and
Dr. Adnan, public health services director of Trabzon, submitted affidavits
reporting cases in which two school buildings were used to organize children
and send them to the mezzanine to kill them with toxic gas equipment. Typhoid
inoculation: The Ottoman surgeon, Dr. Haydar Cemal wrote "on the order of the
Chief Sanitation Office of the Third Army in January 1916, when the spread of
typhus was an acute problem, innocent Armenians slated for deportation at
Erzican were inoculated with the blood of typhoid fever patients without
rendering that blood â€˜inactiveâ€™." Jeremy Hugh Baron writes: "Individual
doctors were directly involved in the massacres, having poisoned infants,
killed children and issued false certificates of death from natural causes.
Nazim's brother-in-law Dr. Tevfik Rushdu, Inspector-General of Health Services,
organized the disposal of Armenian corpses with thousands of kilos of lime over
six months; he became foreign secretary from 1925 to 1938." Deportations. In
May 1915, Mehmed Talaat Pasha requested that the cabinet and Grand Vizier Said
Halim Pasha legalize a measure for relocation and settlement of Armenians to
other places due to what Talaat Pasha called "the Armenian riots and massacres,
which had arisen in a number of places in the country." However, Talaat Pasha
was referring specifically to events in Van and extending the implementation to
the regions in which alleged "riots and massacres" would affect the security of
the war zone of the Caucasus Campaign. Later, the scope of the immigration was
widened in order to include the Armenians in the other provinces. On 13
September 1915, the Ottoman parliament passed the "Temporary Law of
Expropriation and Confiscation", stating that all property, including land,
livestock, and homes belonging to Armenians, was to be confiscated by the
authorities. With the implementation of Tehcir law, the confiscation of
Armenian property and the slaughter of Armenians that ensued upon the law's
enactment outraged much of the western world. While the Ottoman Empire's
wartime allies offered little protest, a wealth of German and Austrian
historical documents has since come to attest to the witnesses' horror at the
killings and mass starvation of Armenians. In the United States, "The New York
Times" reported almost daily on the mass murder of the Armenian people,
describing the process as "systematic", "authorized" and "organized by the
government." Theodore Roosevelt would later characterize this as "the greatest
crime of the war." Historian Hans-Lukas Kieser states that, from the statements
of Talat Pasha it is clear that the officials were aware that the deportation
order was genocidal. Another historian Taner AkÃ§am states that the telegrams
show that the overall coordination of the genocide was taken over by Talat
PaÅŸa. Death marches. The Armenians were marched out to the Syrian town of Deir
ez-Zor and the surrounding desert. A good deal of evidence suggests that the
Ottoman government did not provide any facilities or supplies to sustain the
Armenians during their deportation, nor when they arrived. By August 1915, "The
New York Times" repeated an unattributed report that "the roads and the
Euphrates are strewn with corpses of exiles, and those who survive are doomed
to certain death. It is a plan to exterminate the whole Armenian people."
Ottoman troops escorting the Armenians not only allowed others to rob, kill,
and rape the Armenians, but often participated in these activities themselves.
Deprived of their belongings and marched into the desert, hundreds of thousands
of Armenians perished. Similarly, Major General Friedrich Freiherr Kress von
Kressenstein noted that "The Turkish policy of causing starvation is an all too
obvious proofâ€¦ for the Turkish resolve to destroy the Armenians."
Extermination camps. It is believed that 25Â major concentration camps existed,
under the command of ÅžÃ¼krÃ¼ Kaya, one of the right-hand men of Talaat Pasha.
The majority of the camps were situated near Turkey's modern Iraqi and Syrian
borders, and some were only temporary transit camps. Others, such as Radjo,
Katma, and Azaz, are said to have been used only temporarily, for mass graves;
these sites were vacated by autumn 1915. Some authors also maintain that the
camps Lale, Tefridje, Dipsi, Del-El, and Ra's al-'Ayn were built specifically
for those who had a life expectancy of a few days. Relief. The American
Committee for Relief in the Near East is a relief organization established in
1915, just after the deportations, whose primary aim was to alleviate the
suffering of the Armenian people. Henry Morgenthau played a key role in
rallying support for the organization. Between 1915 and 1930, distributed
humanitarian relief across a wide range of geographical locations. ACRNE
eventually spent over ten times the initial estimate, see original estimate,
that amount and helped an estimated close to 2,000,000 refugees. In its first
year, the ACRNE cared for 132,000 Armenian orphans from Tiflis, Yerevan,
Constantinople, Sivas, Beirut, Damascus, and Jerusalem. A relief organization
for refugees in the Middle East helped donate over $102 million (budget
$117,000,000) value of dollar to Armenians both during and after the war.
Teshkilat-i Mahsusa. The Committee of Union and Progress founded a "special
organization" () that participated in the destruction of the Ottoman Armenian
community. This organization adopted its name in 1913 and functioned like a
special forces outfit, and it has been compared by some scholars to the Nazi
Einsatzgruppen. Later in 1914, the Ottoman government influenced the direction
the special organization was to take by releasing criminals from central
prisons to be the central elements of this newly formed special organization.
According to the Mazhar commissions attached to the tribunal as soon as
November 1914, 124 criminals were released from Pimian prison. Little by little
from the end of 1914 to the beginning of 1915, hundreds, then thousands of
prisoners were freed to form the members of this organization. Later, they were
charged to escort the convoys of Armenian deportees. Vehib Pasha, commander of
the Ottoman Third Army, called those members of the special organization, the
"butchers of the human species." Trials. Turkish courts-martial. The term Three
Pashas, which include Mehmed Talaat Pasha and Ismail Enver, refers to the
triumvirate who had fled the Empire at the end of World War I. At the trials in
Constantinople in 1919 they were sentenced to death in absentia. The courts-
martial officially disbanded the CUP and confiscated its assets, and the assets
of those found guilty. At least two of the three were later assassinated by
Armenian vigilantes. International trials. Following the Mudros Armistice, the
preliminary Peace Conference in Paris established "The Commission on
Responsibilities and Sanctions" in January 1919, which was chaired by US
Secretary of State Lansing. Based on the commission's work, several articles
were added to the Treaty of SÃ¨vres, and the acting government of the Ottoman
Empire, Sultan Mehmed VI and Damat Adil Ferit Pasha, were summoned to trial.
The Treaty of SÃ¨vres (August 1920) planned a trial to determine those
responsible for the "barbarous and illegitimate methods of warfareâ€¦ offenses
against the laws and customs of war and the principles of humanity". Article
230 of the Treaty of SÃ¨vres required the Ottoman Empire "hand over to the
Allied Powers the persons whose surrender may be required by the latter as
being responsible for the massacres committed during the continuance of the
state of war on territory which formed part of the Ottoman Empire on August 1,
1914." Various Ottoman politicians, generals, and intellectuals were
transferred to Malta, where they were held for some three years while searches
were made of archives in Constantinople, London, Paris and Washington to
investigate their actions. However, the Inter-allied tribunal attempt demanded
by the Treaty of SÃ¨vres never solidified and the detainees were eventually
returned to Turkey in exchange for British citizens held by Kemalist Turkey.
Trial of Soghomon Tehlirian. On March 15, 1921, former Grand Vizier Talaat
Pasha was assassinated in the Charlottenburg District of Berlin, Germany, in
broad daylight and in the presence of many witnesses. Talaat's death was part
of ""Operation Nemesis"", the Armenian Revolutionary Federation's codename for
their covert operation in the 1920s to kill the planners of the Armenian
Genocide. The subsequent trial of the assassin, Soghomon Tehlirian, had an
important influence on Raphael Lemkin, a lawyer of Polishâ€“Jewish descent who
campaigned in the League of Nations to ban what he called "barbarity" and
"vandalism". The term "genocide", created in 1943, was coined by Lemkin who was
directly influenced by the massacres of Armenians during World War I. Armenian
population, deaths, survivors, 1914 to 1918. While there is no consensus as to
how many Armenians lost their lives during the Armenian Genocide, there is
general agreement among western scholars that over 500,000Â Armenians died
between 1914 and 1918. Estimates vary between 600,000, to 1,500,000 (per
Western scholars, Argentina, and other states). "EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica"
references the research of Arnold J. Toynbee, an intelligence officer of the
British Foreign Office, who estimated that 600,000Â Armenians "died or were
massacred during deportation" in the years 1915â€“16. According to the Ottoman
Census in 1914 (before the genocide) the total Armenian population was
1,219,323. Contemporaneous reports and reactions. Hundreds of eyewitnesses,
including the neutral United States and the Ottoman Empire's own allies,
Germany and Austria-Hungary, recorded and documented numerous acts of state-
sponsored massacres. Many foreign officials offered to intervene on behalf of
the Armenians, including Pope Benedict XV, only to be turned away by Ottoman
government officials who claimed they were retaliating against a pro-Russian
insurrection. On May 24, 1915, the Triple Entente warned the Ottoman Empire
that "In view of these new crimes of Turkey against humanity and civilization,
the Allied Governments announce publicly to the Sublime Porte that they will
hold personally responsible for these crimes all members of the Ottoman
Government, as well as those of their agents who are implicated in such
massacres." The American Committee for Relief in the Near East (ACRNE, or "Near
East Relief") was a charitable organization established to relieve the
suffering of the peoples of the Near East. The organization was championed by
Henry Morgenthau, Sr., American ambassador to the Ottoman Empire. Morgenthau's
dispatches on the mass slaughter of Armenians galvanized much support for
ACRNE. The U.S. Mission in the Ottoman Empire. The United States had several
consulates throughout the Ottoman Empire, including locations in Edirne,
Kharput, Samsun, Smyrna, Trebizond, Van, Constantinople, and Aleppo. The United
States was officially a neutral party until it joined with the Allies in 1917.
In addition to the consulates, there were also numerous Protestant missionary
compounds established in Armenian-populated regions, including Van and Kharput.
The events were reported regularly in newspapers and literary journals around
the world. On his return to the United States having served for thirty years as
United States Consul and Consul General in the Near East, George Horton wrote
his own account of "the Systematic Extermination of Christian Populations by
Mohammedans and of the Culpability of Certain Great Powers; with the True Story
of the Burning of Smyrna". Horton's account quotes numerous contemporary
communications and eyewitness reports including eyewitness accounts of the
massacre of Phocea in 1914 by a Frenchman and the Armenian massacres of 1914/15
by an American citizen and a German missionary. Many Americans vocally spoke
out against the genocide, including former president Theodore Roosevelt, rabbi
Stephen Wise, William Jennings Bryan, and Alice Stone Blackwell. In the United
States and the United Kingdom, children were regularly reminded to clean their
plates while eating and to "remember the starving Armenians." Ambassador
Morgenthau's Story. As the orders for deportations and massacres were enacted,
many consular officials reported to the ambassador what they were witnessing.
In his memoirs which he completed writing in 1918, Morgenthau wrote, "When the
Turkish authorities gave the orders for these deportations, they were merely
giving the death warrant to a whole race; they understood this well, and, in
their conversations with me, they made no particular attempt to conceal the
factâ€¦" In memoirs and reports, their staff vividly described the brutal
methods used by Ottoman forces and documented numerous instances of atrocities
committed against the Christian minority. Allied forces in the Middle East.
Winston Churchill described the massacres as an "administrative holocaust" and
noted that "the clearance of the race from Asia Minor was about as complete as
such an act, on a scale so great, could well be. [â€¦] There is no reasonable
doubt that this crime was planned and executed for political reasons. The
opportunity presented itself for clearing Turkish soil of a Christian race
opposed to all Turkish ambitions, cherishing national ambitions that could only
be satisfied at the expense of Turkey, and planted geographically between
Turkish and Caucasian Moslems." Arnold Toynbee: The Treatment of Armenians.
Arnold J. Toynbee published a widely studied book The treatment of Armenians in
the Ottoman Empire in 1916. It was a collection of documents. Reacting to
numerous eyewitness accounts, British politician Viscount Bryce and historian
Toynbee compiled statements from survivors and eyewitnesses from other
countries including Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland,
who similarly attested to the systematized massacring of innocent Armenians by
Ottoman government forces. The book has since been criticized as British
wartime propaganda to build up sentiment against the Central Powers, but Bryce
had submitted the work to scholars for verification before its publication.
University of Oxford Regius Professor Gilbert Murray stated, "â€¦the evidence
of these letters and reports will bear any scrutiny and overpower any
skepticism. Their genuineness is established beyond question." Other
professors, including Herbert Fisher of Sheffield University and former
American Bar Association president Moorfield Storey, came to the same
conclusion. Joint Austrian and German mission. As allies during the war, the
Imperial German mission in the Ottoman Empire included both military and
civilian components. Germany had brokered a deal with the Sublime Porte to
commission the building of a railroad stretching from Berlin to the Middle
East, called the Baghdad Railway. Germany's diplomatic mission at the beginning
of 1915 was led by Ambassador Baron Hans Freiherr von Wangenheim (who was later
succeeded by Count Paul Wolff Metternich following his death in 1915). Like
Morgenthau, von Wangenheim began to receive many disturbing messages from
consul officials around the Ottoman Empire detailing the massacre of Armenians.
From the province of Adana, Consul Eugene Buge reported that the CUP chief had
sworn to kill and massacre any Armenians who survived the deportation marches.
In June 1915, von Wangenheim sent a cable to Berlin reporting that Talat had
admitted that the deportations were not "being carried out because of 'military
considerations alone.'" One month later, he came to the conclusion that there
"no longer was doubt that the Porte was trying to exterminate the Armenian race
in the Turkish Empire." When Wolff-Metternich succeeded von Wangenheim, he
continued to dispatch similar cables: "The Committee demands the extirpation of
the last remnants of the Armenians and the government must yieldâ€¦ A Committee
representative is assigned to each of the provincial administrationsâ€¦
Turkification means license to expel, to kill or destroy everything that is not
Turkish." Another notable figure in the German military camp was Max Erwin von
Scheubner-Richter, who documented various massacres of Armenians. He sent
fifteen reports regarding "deportations and mass killings" to the German
chancellery. His final report noted that fewer than 100,000 Armenians were left
alive in the Ottoman Empire: the rest having been exterminated (). Scheubner-
Richter also detailed the methods of the Ottoman government, noting its use of
the Special Organization and other bureaucratized instruments of genocide. I
have lived in Turkey the larger part of my lifeâ€¦ and I know the Armenians. I
also know that both Armenians and Turks cannot live together in this country.
One of these races has got to go. And I don't blame the Turks for what they are
doing to the Armenians. I think that they are entirely justified. The weaker
nation must succumb. The Armenians desire to dismember Turkey; they are against
the Turks and the Germans in this war, and they therefore have no right to
exist here. In a genocide conference held in 2001, professor Wolfgang Wipperman
of the Free University of Berlin introduced documents evidencing that the
German High Command was aware of the mass killings at the time but chose not to
interfere or speak out. Photographs exist that may also suggest the Germans
participated in the mass killing and some of the German witnesses to the
Armenian holocaust would go on to play a role in the Nazi regime - Konstantin
Freiherr von Neurath, for example, was attached to the Turkish 4th Army in 1915
with instructions to monitor "operations" against the Armenians who later
became Hitler's foreign minister and "Protector of Bohemia and Moravia" during
Reinhard Heydrich's terror in Czechoslovakia. Armin T. Wegner. German military
medic Armin T. Wegner enrolled as a medic at the outbreak of World War I during
the winter of 1914â€“15. He defied censorship in taking hundreds of photographs
of Armenians being deported and subsequently starving in northern Syrian camps
and in the deserts of Der Zor. Wegner was part of a German detachment under von
der Goltz stationed near the Baghdad Railway in Mesopotamia. Wegner was
eventually arrested by the Germans and recalled to Germany. Wegner protested
against the atrocities perpetrated in an open letter submitted to US President
Woodrow Wilson at the peace conference of 1919. The letter made a case for the
creation of an independent Armenian state. Also in 1919, Wegner published "The
Road of No Return" ("Der Weg ohne Heimkehr"), a collection of letters he had
written during what he deemed the "martyrdom" (German: "Martyrium") of the
Armenians. A documentary film depicting Wegner's personal account of the
Armenian Genocide through his own photographs called "Destination Nowhere: The
Witness" and produced by Dr J Michael Hagopian premiered in Fresno on 25 April
2000. Prior to the release of the documentary he was honored at the Armenian
Genocide Museum in Yerevan for championing the plight of Armenians throughout
his life. Russian military. The Russian Empire's response to the bombardment of
its Black Sea naval ports was primarily a land campaign through the Caucasus.
Early victories against the Ottoman Empire from the winter of 1914 to the
spring 1915 saw significant gains of territory, including relieving the
Armenian bastion resisting in the city of Van in May 1915. The Russians also
reported encountering the bodies of unarmed civilian Armenians as they
advanced. In March 1916, the scenes they saw in the city of Erzerum led the
Russians to retaliate against the Ottoman III Army whom they held responsible
for the massacres, destroying it in its entirety. Swedish Embassy and Military
AttachÃ©. On August 9, 1915, AnckarsvÃ¤rd dispatched yet another report,
confirming his suspicions regarding the plans of the Turkish government, "It is
obvious that the Turks are taking the opportunity to, now during the war,
annihilate [utplÃ¥na] the Armenian nation so that when the peace comes no
Armenian question longer exists." When reflecting upon the situation in Turkey
during the final stages of the war, Envoy Alhgren presented an analysis of the
prevailing situation in Turkey and the hard times which had befallen the
population. In explaining the increased living costs he identified a number of
reasons: "obstacles for domestic trade, the almost total paralysing of the
foreign trade and finally the strong decreasing of labour power, caused partly
by the mobilisation but partly also by the extermination of the Armenian race
af den armeniska rasen." WirsÃ©n, when writing his memoirs from his mission to
the Balkans and Turkey, "Minnen frÃ¥n fred och krig" ("Memories from Peace and
War"), dedicated an entire chapter to the Armenian genocide, entitled "Mordet
pÃ¥ en nation" ("The Murder of a Nation"). Commenting on the interpretation
that the deportations resulted from the purported collaboration of the
Armenians with the Russians, Wirsen concludes that their subsequent
deportations were nothing but a cover for their extermination.: "Officially,
these had the goal to move the entire Armenian population to the steppe regions
of Northern Mesopotamia and Syria, but in reality they aimed to exterminate the
Armenians, whereby the pure Turkish element in Asia Minor would achieve a
dominating position." In conclusion, WirsÃ©n made the following note: "The
annihilation of the Armenian nation in Asia Minor must revolt all human
feelingsâ€¦ The way the Armenian problem was solved was hair-raising. I can
still see in front of me Talaat's cynical expression, when he emphasized that
the Armenian question was solved." Bodil BiÃ¸rn. In 1905 the missionary nurse
Bodil BiÃ¸rn (1871â€“1960) was sent to Armenia. First based in the town of
Mezereh (now Elazig) and later in Mush, she worked for widows and orphaned
children in cooperation with missionaries from the German HÃ¼lfsbund. She
witnessed the massacres of 1915 in Mush and saw most of the children in her
care murdered along with Armenian priests, teachers, and assistants. She barely
escaped after 9 days on horseback but stayed on in the region for another 2
years under increasingly difficult working conditions. After a period at home
she again went to Armenia and, until she retired in 1935, worked for Armenian
refugees in Syria and Lebanon. Bodil BiÃ¸rn was also an able photographer. Many
of her photos are now in the WMF archive, which since the organisation was
dissolved in 1982 has been preserved in the National Archives of Norway. In
combination with her comments, written in her photo albums or on the back of
the prints themselves, these photos bear strong witness of the atrocities that
she saw. Ottoman reactions. Halil PaÅŸa (Kut), uncle of Enver PaÅŸa wrote "the
Armenian nation, because of trying to erase my country from history as
prisoners of the enemy, in the most horrible and painful days of my
homelandâ€¦" in his memory. In 1919, Ahmet Refik wrote "the Unionists
(Committee of Union and Progress) wanted to remove the problem of VilÃ¢yÃ¢t-Ä±
Sitte with annihilating Armenians" in his work entitled "Ä°ki Komite Ä°ki
KÄ±tal". Persia. Throughout history, the nation of Persia (now known as Iran)
has usually regarded itself as the protector of Armenian nation whom they
considered as fellows due to their both belonging to the Aryan race. However,
in this case, due to the weak central government in Tehran's inability to
protect its territorial integrity, no resistance was offered by the mostly
Islamic Persian troops when, after the withdrawal of Russian troops from the
extreme northwest of Persia, Islamic Turks invaded the town of Salmas in
northwestern Persia and tortured and massacred the Christian Armenian
inhabitants in the cruelest possible manner. Study of the Armenian Genocide.
The Armenian Genocide is widely corroborated by the international genocide
scholars. The International Association of Genocide Scholars (IAGS), consisting
of world's foremost experts on genocide, unanimously passed a formal resolution
affirming the fact of the Armenian Genocide. According to IAGS, "Every book on
comparative genocide studies in the English language contains a segment on the
Armenian Genocide. Leading texts in the international law of genocide such as
William Schabas's 'Genocide in International Law' cite the Armenian Genocide as
presursor to the Holocaust and as a precedent for the law on crimes against
humanity. Polish Jurist Raphael Lemkin, when he coined the term genocide in
1944, cited the Turkish extermination of the Armenians and the Nazi
extermination of the Jews as defining examples of what he meant by genocide.
The killings of Armenians is genocide as defined by the 1948 United Nations
Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. 126
leading scholars of the holocaust including Elie Wiesel, and Yehuda Bauer
placed a statement in the "New York Times" in June 2000 declaring the
"inconstestable fact of the Armenian genocide" and urging western democracies
to acknowledge it. "The Institute on the Holocaust and Genocide (Jerusalem),
and the Institute for the Study of Genocide (NYC), have affirmed the historical
fact of the Armenian Genocide." British historian Arnold J. Toynbee, whose 1917
report remains a critical primary source, changed his evaluation later in life,
concluding, "Theseâ€¦Armenian political aspirations had not been
legitimate...Their aspirations did not merely threaten to break up the Turkish
Empire; they could not be fulfilled without doing grave injustice to the
Turkish people itself." For Turkish historians, supporting the national
republican myth is essential to preserving Turkish national unity. The usual
Turkish argument is that the deportations were necessary because the Armenians
had allied themselves with the Russian army in wartime and that around 600,000
Armenians perished during the marches, largely due to isolated massacres,
disease, or malnourishment. "There was no genocide committed against the
Armenians in the Ottoman Empire before or during World War I." Genocide
scholars Roger Smith, Eric Markusen, and Robert Jay Lifton wrote in
"Professional Ethics and the Denial of the Armenian Genocide" (Holocaust and
Genocide Studies): "Where scholars deny genocide in the face of decisive
evidence ... they contribute to false consciousness that can have the most dire
reverbrations. Their message, in effect, is ... mass murder requires no
confrontation, no reflection, but should be ignored, glossed over." Some
dissident historians and scholars in Turkey, including Yektan TÃ¼rkyilmaz, have
been trying to reclaim the Armenians as part of Ottoman and Turkish history and
acknowledge the wrongs done to the Armenians as a condition for reconciliation
with them on the basis of confidence in Turkish national unity. Defining
"genocide". Law professor Raphael Lemkin, who coined the term "genocide" in
1943, has stated that he did so with the fate of the Armenians in mind,
explaining that "it happened so many timesâ€¦ First to the Armenians, then
after the Armenians, Hitler took action." Several international organizations
have conducted studies of the events, each in turn determining that the term
"genocide" aptly describes "the Ottoman massacre of Armenians in 1915â€“16."
Among the organizations affirming this conclusion are the International Center
for Transitional Justice, the International Association of Genocide Scholars,
and the United Nations' Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and
Protection of Minorities. One public figure who objected to the use of the term
"genocide" was Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, who was subsequently
rebutted by Dr Israel Charny, executive director of the Institute on the
Holocaust and Genocide in Jerusalem. In 2002, the International Center for
Transitional Justice (ICTJ) was asked by the Turkish Armenian Reconciliation
Commission to provide a report on the applicability of the Genocide Convention
to the controversy. An independent legal counsel drafted memorandum for the
ICTJ stated that in the opinion of the independent legal counsel "legal
scholars as well as historians, politicians, journalists and other people would
be justified in continuing to so describe events as genocide" and further that
the Republic of Turkey was not liable for the event. In 2005, the International
Association of Genocide Scholars affirmed that scholarly evidence revealed the
"Young Turk government of the Ottoman Empire began a systematic genocide of its
Armenian citizensÂ â€“ an unarmed Christian minority population. More than a
million Armenians were exterminated through direct killing, starvation,
torture, and forced death marches." The IAGS also condemned Turkish attempts to
deny the factual and moral reality of the Armenian Genocide. In 2007, the Elie
Wiesel Foundation for Humanity] produced a letter signed by 53 Nobel Laureates
re-affirming the Genocide Scholars' conclusion that the 1915 killings of
Armenians constituted genocide. While some consider denial to be a form of hate
speech or politically minded historical revisionism, several western academics
have expressed doubts as to the genocidal character of the events. The most
important counterpoint may be that of British scholar Bernard Lewis. While he
had once written of "the terrible holocaust of 1915, when a million and a half
Armenians perished", he later came to believe that the term "genocide" was
distinctly inaccurate, because the "tremendous massacres" were not "a
deliberate preconceived decision of the Turkish government." This opinion has
been joined by Guenter Lewy. Academic views within the Republic of Turkey are
often at odds with international consensus: this may partly stem from the fact
that to acknowledge the Armenian genocide in Turkey carries with it a risk of
criminal prosecution. Many Turkish intellectuals have been prosecuted for
characterizing the massacres as genocide. Bat Ye'or has suggested that "the
genocide of the Armenians was a jihad." Ye'or holds jihad and what she calls
"dhimmitude" to be among the "principles and values" that led to the Armenian
Genocide. This perspective is challenged by FÃ 'iz el-Ghusein, a Bedouin Arab
witness of the Armenian persecution, whose 1918 treatise aimed "to refute
beforehand inventions and slanders against the Faith of Islam and against
Moslems generallyâ€¦ the Armenians have suffered is to be attributed to the
Committee of Union and Progressâ€¦ [It has been due to their nationalist
fanaticism and their jealousy of the Armenians, and to these alone; the Faith
of Islam is guiltless of their deeds." Arnold Toynbee writes that "the Young
Turks made Pan-Islamism and Turkish Nationalism work together for their ends,
but the development of their policy shows the Islamic element receding and the
Nationalist gaining ground." Toynbee, and various other sources, report that
many Armenians were spared death by marrying into Turkish families or
converting to Islam. El-Ghusein points out that many converts were put to
death, concerned that Westerners would come to regard the "extermination of the
Armenians" as "a black stain on the history of Islam, which ages will not
efface." In one instance, when an Islamic leader appealed to spare Armenian
converts to Islam, El-Ghusein quotes a government functionary as responding
that "politics have no religion", before sending the converts to their deaths.
Noam Chomsky has suggested that, rather than the Armenian Genocide having been
relegated to the periphery of public awareness, "more people are aware of the
Armenian genocide during the First World War than are aware of the Indonesian
genocide in 1965". Taner AkÃ§am's "A Shameful Act" has contextualized the
Armenian Genocide with the desperate Ottoman struggle at Gallipoli, suggesting
that panic of imminent destruction caused Ottoman authorities to opt for
deportation and extermination. On October 10, 2009 in Zurich, despite
overwhelming opposition by Armenians in Armenia and in the Diaspora, the
Armenian government signed the Armenia-Turkey Protocols, one of the provisions
of which stipulates the establishment of a research commission "to study the
two country's historical grievances." The agreement must still be ratified by
the parliaments of both countries in order to take effect. Just a day before,
on 9 October 2009 in London, Geoffrey Robertson QC, eminent jurist, barrister
and judge, published a detailed legal opinion which comprehensively and
methodically countered the British Government's reasons for not formally
recognizing the Armenian Genocide. Republic of Turkey and the Genocide.
According to Kemal Ã‡iÃ§ek, the head of the Armenian Research Group at the
Turkish Historical Society, in Turkey there is no official thesis on the
Armenian issue. The Republic of Turkey's formal stance is that the deaths of
Armenians during the "relocation" or "deportation" cannot aptly be deemed
"genocide", a position that has been supported with a plethora of diverging
justifications: that the killings were not deliberate or were not
governmentally orchestrated, that the killings were justified because Armenians
posed a Russian-sympathizing threat as a cultural group, that Armenians merely
starved, or any of various characterizations recalling marauding "Armenian
gangs." Some suggestions seek to invalidate the genocide on semantic or
anachronistic grounds (the word "genocide" was not coined until 1943). Turkish
World War I casualty figures are often cited to mitigate the effect of the
number of Armenian dead. According to the retired ambassador of Turkey to
Germany and Spain; Volkan Vural, the Turkish state should apologize for what
happened to the Armenians during the deportations of 1915 and what happened to
the Greeks during Istanbul Pogrom He also states that, "I think that, the
Armenian issue can be solved by politicians and not by historians. I don't
believe that historical facts about this issue is not revealed. The historical
facts are already known. The most important point here is that how this facts
will be interpreted and will affect the future." . In 2007, Turkish Prime
Minister Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan issued a circular that calls the government
institutions to use "1915 Events" (in Turkish, 1915 OlaylarÄ±) phrase instead
of the "so-called Armenian genocide" (in Turkish, sÃ¶zde Ermeni soykÄ±rÄ±mÄ±)
phrase. Turkey has started an "Initiative to Resolve Armenian Allegations
Regarding 1915", by using archives in Turkey, Armenia and other countries.
Armenian president Robert Kocharian rejected this offer by saying, "It is the
responsibility of governments to develop bilateral relations and we do not have
the right to delegate that responsibility to historians. That is why we have
proposed and propose again that, without pre-conditions, we establish normal
relations between our two countries." Additionally, Turkish foreign minister of
the time, Abdullah GÃ¼l, invited the United States and other countries to
contribute to such a commission by appointing scholars to "investigate this
tragedy and open ways for Turks and Armenians to come together". The Turkish
government continues to protest against the formal recognition of the genocide
by other countries and to dispute that there ever was a genocide.
Controversies. Efforts by the Turkish government and its agents to quash
mention of the genocide have resulted in numerous scholarly, diplomatic,
political and legal controversies. Prosecutors acting on their own initiative
have utilized Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code prohibiting "insulting
Turkishness" to silence a number of prominent Turkish intellectuals who spoke
of atrocities suffered by Armenians in the last days of the Ottoman Empire (as
of yet, most of these cases have been dismissed). These prosecutions have often
been accompanied by hate campaigns and threats, as was the case for Hrant Dink,
who was prosecuted three times for "denigrating Turkishness", and murdered in
2007. Later, photographs of the assassin being honored as a hero while in
police custody, posing in front of the Turkish flag with grinning policemen,
gave the academic community still more cause for pause with regard to engaging
the Armenian issue. The leading lawyer behind the prosecutions, Kemal
KerinÃ§siz, is accused of plotting to overthrow the government as being a
member of the alleged Ergenekon network. In 1973 Turkey recalled its ambassador
to France to protest the Genocide monument erected in Marseilles "to the memory
of the 1.5 million Armenian victims of the genocide ordered by the Turkish
rulers in 1915". In 1982, the Israeli Foreign Ministry attempted to prevent an
international conference on genocide, held in Tel Aviv, from including any
mention of the Armenian Genocide. Several reports suggested that Turkey had
warned that Turkish Jews might face "reprisals", if the conference permitted
Armenian participation. This charge was "categorically denied" by Turkey; the
Israeli Foreign Ministry supported Turkey in this protestation that there had
been no threats against Jews, suggesting that its misgivings as to the genocide
conference were based on considerations "vital to the Jewish nation." In the
same year (1982), the Institute of Turkish Studies in Washington, D.C. (ITS)
was established by a $3 million grant from the Turkish Government. Israel
Charny identifies ITS and some of its foremost deniers of the Armenian
genocide, such as Stanford Shaw, Heath W. Lowry, and Justin McCarthy, as the
Turkish government's principal agency in USA for promoting research on Turkey
and the Ottoman Empire, but also denial of the Armenian Genocide. A 1989 U.S.
Senate proposal to recognize the Armenian Genocide stoked the ire of Turkey.
The proposal occurred in the context of the publication of internal U.S.
documents which laid out a State Department official's eyewitness report that
"thousands and thousands of Armenians, mostly innocent and helpless women and
children, were butchered", in the last days of the Ottoman Empire. Turkey
responded by blocking United States Navy visits to Turkey and suspending some
US military training facilities on Turkish territory. The American scholar who
assembled the US archive documents for publication went into hiding after a
series of anonymous threats. In 1990, psychologist Robert Jay Lifton received a
letter from the Turkish Ambassador to the United States, questioning his
inclusion of references to the Armenian Genocide in one of his books. The
ambassador inadvertently included a draft of the letter, presented by scholar
Heath W. Lowry, advising the ambassador on how to prevent mention of the
Armenian Genocide in scholarly works. In 1996, Lowry was named to a chair at
Princeton University that had been financed by the Turkish government, sparking
a debate on ethics in scholarship. In 1993, RagÄ±p Zarakolu a Turkish human
rights activist published the Turkish translation of the book called "History
of the Genocide" written by Yves Ternon. The book was the first to be published
in Turkey that openly acknowledged the event in 1915 as Genocide. Soon after
its publication, he started to receive threats and eventually in 1994 the
publishing firm of RagÄ±p Zorakolu was the target of a serious bomb attack.
During a February 2005 interview with "Das Magazin", novelist Orhan Pamuk made
statements implicating Turkey in massacres against Armenians and persecution of
the Kurds, declaring: "Thirty thousand Kurds and a million Armenians were
killed in these lands and nobody but me dares to talk about it". Subjected to a
hate campaign, he left Turkey, before returning in 2005 to defend his right to
freedom of speech: "What happened to the Ottoman Armenians in 1915 was a major
thing that was hidden from the Turkish nation; it was a taboo. But we have to
be able to talk about the past". However, when asked about his speech on CNN
TURK television, Pamuk stated that "I did not estimate the number of killed
Armenians, I did not use the word genocide, I did say Armenians were killed,
but I did not say Armenians were killed by Turks". Lawyers of two Turkish
ultranationalist professional associations led by Kemal KerinÃ§siz then brought
criminal charges against Pamuk. However, on January 23, 2006 the charges of
"insulting Turkishness" were dropped (for formal reasons without finding it
necessary to judge on the essence of the case), a move welcomed by the EU. That
the charges had been brought at all was still a matter of contention for
European politicians. According to some newly discovered documents that
belonged to the interior minister of the Ottoman Empire, more than 970,000
Ottoman Armenians disappeared from official population records from 1915
through 1916. These documents have been published in a recent book titled "The
Remaining Documents of Talat Pasha" (aka "Talat Pasha's Black Book") written by
the Turkish journalist Murat BardakÃ§Ä±. The book is a collection of documents
and records that once belonged to Mehmed Talat, known as Talat Pasha, the
primary architect of the Armenian deportations. The documents were given to Mr.
BardakÃ§Ä± by Mr Talat's widow, Hayriye Talat BafralÄ±, in 1983. According to
the documents, the number of Armenians living in the Ottoman Empire before 1915
stood at 1,256,000. The number plunged to 284,157 two years later in 1917. "BBC
â€“ Turkey threatens to expel 100,000 Armenians." "BBC News". March 17, 2010.
The answer to ErdoÄŸan came from the Armenian Prime Minister; he said that this
kind of threat reminded Armenians of the Armenian Genocide and neither did they
improve relations between the two countries. The exact number of illegal
Armenians in Turkey is unknown, but the estimation is only 12,000 â€“ 13,000
contrary to number used by the Turkish prime minister. Armenia and the
Genocide. Armenia has been involved in a protracted ethnic-territorial conflict
with Azerbaijan, a Turkic state, since Azerbaijan became independent from the
Soviet Union in 1991. The conflict has featured several pogroms, massacres, and
waves of ethnic cleansing, by both sides. Some foreign policy observers and
historians have suggested that Armenia and the Armenian diaspora have sought to
portray the modern conflict as a continuation of the Armenian Genocide, in
order to influence modern policy-making in the region. According to Thomas
Ambrosio, the Armenian Genocide furnishes "a reserve of public sympathy and
moral legitimacy that translates into significant political influenceâ€¦ to
elicit congressional support for anti-Azerbaijan policies." The rhetoric
leading up to the onset of the conflict, which unfolded in the context of
several pogroms of Armenians, was dominated by references to the Armenian
Genocide, including fears that it would be, or was in the course of being,
repeated. During the conflict, the Azeri and Armenian governments regularly
accused each other of genocidal intent, although these claims have been treated
skeptically by outside observers. The worldwide recognition of the Genocide is
a core aspect of Armenia's foreign policy and overarching grand strategy.
Recognition of the Genocide. Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly
Resolution, April 24, 1998 ""Today we commemorate the anniversary of what has
been called the first genocide of the 20th century, and we salute the memory of
the Armenian victims of this crime against humanity"". As a response to the
continuing denial of the Armenian Genocide by the Turkish State, many activists
among Armenian Diaspora communities have pushed for formal recognition of the
Armenian genocide from various governments around the world. 20 countries and
42Â U.S. states have adopted resolutions acknowledging the Armenian Genocide as
a "bona fide" historical event. On March 4, 2010, a US congressional panel
narrowly voted that the incident was indeed genocide; within minutes the
Turkish government issued a statement critical of "this resolution which
accuses the Turkish nation of a crime it has not committed." The Armenian
Assembly of America (AAA) and the single largest organisation with the AAA the
Armenian National Committee of America (ANCA) have as their main lobbying
agenda to press Congress and the President of the United States for an increase
of economic aid for Armenia (already the second largest per capita after
Israel) and the reduction economic and military assistance for Turkey. The
efforts also include reaffirmation of a genocide by Ottoman Turkey in 1915.
Despite his previous public recognition and support of Genocide bills, as well
as the election campaign promises to formally recognize the Armenian Genocide,
the U.S. President, Barack Obama, although repeating that his views on the
issue have not changed, has thus far abstained from using the term 'genocide'.
On April 24 commemoration speeches President Obama has yet referred to the
Armenian Genocide only by the Armenian synonym Metz Eghern ("Mec EÄ¡eá¹™n").
Cultural loss. The premeditated destruction of objects of Armenian cultural,
religious, historical and communal heritage was yet another key purpose of both
the genocide itself and the post-genocidal campaign of denial. Armenian
churches and monasteries were destroyed or changed into mosques, Armenian
cemeteries flattened, and, in several cities (e.g. Van), Armenian quarters were
demolished. Aside from the deaths, Armenians lost their wealth and property
without compensation. Businesses and farms were lost, and all schools,
churches, hospitals, orphanages, monasteries, and graveyards became Turkish
state property. In January 1916, the Ottoman Minister of Commerce and
Agriculture issued a decree ordering all financial institutions operating
within the empire's borders to turn over Armenian assets to the government. It
is recorded that as much as 6 million Turkish gold pounds were seized along
with real property, cash, bank deposits, and jewelry. The assets were then
funneled to European banks, including Deutsche and Dresdner banks. After the
end of World War I, Genocide survivors tried to return and reclaim their former
homes and assets, but were driven out by the Ankara Government. In 1914, the
Armenian Patriarch in Constantinople presented a list of the Armenian holy
sites under his supervision. The list contained 2,549 religious places of which
200 were monasteries while 1,600 were churches. In 1974 UNESCO stated that
after 1923, out of 913 Armenian historical monuments left in Eastern Turkey,
464 have vanished completely, 252 are in ruins, and 197 are in need of repair
(in stable conditions). Armenian Genocide reparations. The grounds of the
International Law. The United Nations Basic Principles and Guidelines on the
Right to Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of Human Rights and
International Humanitarian Law provide in part, that reparation may be claimed
individually and where appropriate collectively, by the direct victims of
violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, the immediate
family, dependants or other persons or groups of persons closely connected with
the direct victims. According to Henry Theriault, while current members of
Turkish society cannot be blamed morally for the destruction of Armenians,
present-day Republic of Turkey, as successor state to the Ottoman Empire and as
beneficiary of the wealth and land expropriations brought forth through the
genocide, is responsible for reparations. Particularly important are Principles
9 and 12 that state, that civil claims relating to reparations for gross
violations of human rights and international humanitarian law shall not be
subject to statutes of limitations (article 9), and that restitution shall be
provided to re-establish the situation that existed prior to the violations of
human rights or international humanitarian law. The restitution requires,
"inter alia" â€“ return to one's place of residence and restoration of
property. Professor of International Law of Geneva School of Diplomacy (J.D.
â€“ Harvard, Dr.phil. â€“ GÃ¶ttingen), former Secretary of the UN Human Rights
Committee and former Chief of Petitions at the Office of the UN High
Commissioner for Human Rights, Dr. Alfred de Zayas stated, that because of the
continuing character of the crime of genocide in factual and legal terms, the
remedy of restitution has not been foreclosed. Thus the survivors of the
genocide against the Armenians, both individually and collectively, have
standing to advance a claim for restitution. Whenever possible complete
restitution or restoration to the previous condition should be granted. But
where is not possible, relevant compensation may be substituted as a remedy. In
an article published in European Journal of International Law, Vahagn Avedian,
rather leaving the limitations of the UN Genocide Convention, emphasizes the
applicability of the then and now prevailing international laws, e.g. the Hague
Conventions of 1899 and 1907, more specifically the Martens Clause, pertaining
to the protection of civilian population, but also existing international laws
on unlawful confiscation etc. Thus, the actions of the Turkish governments (the
Ottoman, the insurgent nationalist movement as well as the succeeding
republic), should be viewed from the perspective of Internationally Wrongful
Acts. Avedian argues that: SÃ¨vres Treaty. Although there are different
opinions on the legitimacy of the Treaty of SÃ¨vres and its relativity to
reparation claims, there are specialists who claim that some of its elements
retain the force of law. In particular, the fixing of the proper borders of an
Armenian state was undertaken pursuant to the treaty and determined by a
binding arbitral award, regardless of whether the treaty was ultimately
ratified. "The committee process determining the arbitral award was agreed to
by the parties" and, according to international law, the resulting
determination has legal force regardless of the ultimate fate of the treaty.
Lawsuits. In July 2004, after California Legislature passed the Armenian
Genocide Insurance Act, descendants of Armenian Genocide victims settled a case
for about 2,400 life insurance policies from New York Life written on Armenians
living in the Ottoman Empire. Around 1918, the Turkish government attempted to
recover for the people it had killed with the argument that there are no
identifiable heirs to the policy holders. The settlement provided $20 million,
of which $11 million was for heirs of the Genocide victims. Commemoration.
Memorials. Over 135 memorials, spread across 25 countries, commemorate the
Armenian Genocide. In 1965, the 50th anniversary of the genocide, a 24-hour
mass protest was initiated in Yerevan demanding recognition of the Armenian
Genocide by Soviet authorities. The memorial was completed two years later, at
Tsitsernakaberd above the Hrazdan gorge in Yerevan. The stele symbolizes the
national rebirth of Armenians. Twelve slabs are positioned in a circle,
representing 12Â lost provinces in present day Turkey. At the center of the
circle there is an eternal flame. Each April 24, hundreds of thousands of
people walk to the genocide monument and lay flowers around the eternal flame.
Another memorial, in Alfortville, France, near Paris, was bombed on May 3,
1984, by a hit-team headed by Grey Wolves member Abdullah Ã‡atlÄ± and paid by
the Turkish intelligence agency (MÄ°T). Representation in popular culture. The
earliest example of the Armenian genocide on art was a medal issued in St.
Petersburg, signifying Russian sympathy for Armenian suffering. It was struck
in 1915, as the massacres and deportations were still raging. Since then,
dozens of medals in different countries have been commissioned to commemorate
the event. Several eyewitness accounts of the events were published, notably
those of Swedish missionary Alma Johansson and U.S. Ambassador Henry
Morgenthau, Sr. German medic Armin Wegner wrote several books about the events
he witnessed while stationed in the Ottoman Empire. Years later, having
returned to Germany, Wegner was imprisoned for opposing Nazism, and his books
were burnt by the Nazis. Probably the best known literary work on the Armenian
Genocide is Franz Werfel's 1933 "The Forty Days of Musa Dagh". It was a
bestseller that became particularly popular among the youth of the Jewish
ghettos during the Nazi era. Kurt Vonnegut's 1988 novel "Bluebeard" features
the Armenian Genocide as an underlying theme. Other novels incorporating the
Armenian Genocide include Louis de BerniÃ©res' "Birds without Wings", Edgar
Hilsenrath's German-language "The Story of the Last Thought", and Polish Stefan
Å»eromski's 1925 "The Spring to Come". A story in Edward Saint-Ivan's 2006
anthology "The Black Knight's God" includes a fictional survivor of the
Armenian Genocide. The first film about the Armenian Genocide appeared in 1919,
a Hollywood production titled "Ravished Armenia". It resonated with acclaimed
director Atom Egoyan, influencing his 2002 "Ararat". There are also references
in Elia Kazan's "America, America" and Henri Verneuil's "Mayrig". At the Berlin
Film Festival of 2007 Italian directors Paolo and Vittorio Taviani presented
another film about the events, based on Antonia Arslan's book, "La Masseria
Delle Allodole" ("The Farm of the Larks"). Richard Kalinoski's play, "Beast on
the Moon", is about two Armenian Genocide survivors. The paintings of Armenian-
American Arshile Gorky, a seminal figure of Abstract Expressionism, are
considered to have been informed by the suffering and loss of the period. In
1915, at age 10, Gorky fled his native Van and escaped to Russian-Armenia with
his mother and three sisters, only to have his mother die of starvation in
Yerevan in 1919. His two "The Artist and His Mother" paintings are based on a
photograph with his mother taken in Van. In 1975, famous French-Armenian singer
Charles Aznavour recorded the song "Ils sont tombÃ©s" ("They Fell"), dedicated
to the memory of Armenian Genocide victims. American composer and singer Daniel
Decker has achieved critical acclaim for his collaborations with Armenian
composer Ara Gevorgyan. The song "Adana", named for the province of a 1909
pogrom of the Armenian people, tells the story of the Armenian Genocide.
"Adana" has been translated into 17 languages and recorded by singers around
the world. The American band System of a Down, composed of four descendants of
Armenian Genocide survivors, has promoted awareness of the Armenian Genocide
through its lyrics, including P.L.U.C.K. and in concerts. In late 2003,
Diamanda GalÃ¡s released the album "Defixiones, Will and Testament: Orders from
the Dead", an 80-minute memorial tribute to the Armenian, Assyrian and Greek
victims of the genocide in Turkey. "The performance is an angry meditation on
genocide and the politically cooperative denial of it, in particular the
Turkish and American denial of the Armenian, Assyrian, and Anatolian Greek
genocides from 1914 to 1923".
