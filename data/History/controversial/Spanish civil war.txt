Spanish Civil War The Spanish Civil War was fought from 17 July 1936 to 1 April
1939 between the Republicans, who were loyal to the established Spanish
republican government, and the Nationalists, a rebel group led by General
Francisco Franco. The Nationalists prevailed and Franco would rule Spain as
dictator for the next 36 years. The war began after a "pronunciamiento"
(declaration of opposition) by a group of generals of the Spanish Republican
Armed Forces under the leadership of Jos√© Sanjurjo against the elected
government of the Second Spanish Republic, at the time under the leadership of
President Manuel Aza√±a. The rebel coup was supported by a number of
conservative groups including the Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous
Right, monarchists such as the religious conservative Carlists, and the Fascist
Falange. The coup was supported by units in Morocco, Pamplona, Burgos,
Valladolid, C√°diz, Cordova, and Seville. However, barracks in important cities
such as Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Bilbao and M√°laga did not join in the
rebellion. Spain was left militarily and politically divided. The rebels led by
Franco then embarked upon a war of attrition against the established government
for the control of the country. The rebel forces received the support of Nazi
Germany and the Kingdom of Italy, as well as neighbouring Portugal, while the
Soviet Union and Mexico intervened in support of the Republican government or
loyalist side. Other countries, such as the Untied Kingdom and France operated
an official policy of non-intervention. Atrocities were committed by both sides
in the war. Organised purges occurred in territory captured by Franco's forces
to consolidate the future regime. A smaller but significant number of killings
took place in areas controlled by the Republicans, normally associated with a
breakdown in law and order. The extent to which killings in Republican
territory were carried out with connivance of the Republican authorities
varied. The Civil War became notable for the passion and political division it
inspired. Tens of thousands of civilians on both sides were killed for their
political or religious views, and after the War's conclusion in 1939, those
associated with the losing Republicans were persecuted by the victorious
Nationalists. The war ended with the victory of the Nationalists and the exile
of thousands of left-leaning Spaniards, many of whom fled to refugee camps in
Southern France. With the establishment of a dictatorship led by General
Francisco Franco in the aftermath of the Civil War, all right-wing parties were
fused into the structure of the Franco regime. Background. At the end of the
19th century, the owners of large estates, called "latifundia", held most of
the power in a land-based oligarchy. The landowners' power was unsuccessfully
challenged by the industrial and merchant sectors. In 1868 popular uprisings
led to the overthrow of Queen Isabella II of the House of Bourbon. In 1873
Isabella's replacement, King Amadeo I of the House of Savoy, abdicated due to
increasing political pressure, and the short-lived First Spanish Republic was
proclaimed. After the restoration of the Bourbons in December 1874, Carlists
and anarchists emerged in opposition to the monarchy. Alejandro Lerroux helped
bring republicanism to the fore in Catalonia, where poverty was particularly
acute. Growing resentment of conscription and of the military culminated in the
Tragic Week in Barcelona in 1909. After the First World War, the working class,
the industrial class, and the military united in hopes of removing the corrupt
central government, but were unsuccessful. Fears of communism grew. A military
coup brought Miguel Primo de Rivera to power in 1923, and he ran Spain as a
military dictatorship. Support for his regime gradually faded, and he resigned
in January 1930. There was little support for the monarchy in the major cities,
and King Alfonso XIII abdicated; the Second Spanish Republic was formed, whose
power would remain until the culmination of the Spanish Civil War. Niceto
Alcal√°-Zamora became the first prime minister. The Republic had broad support
from all segments of society; elections in June 1931 returned a large majority
of Republicans and Socialists. With the onset of the Great Depression, the
government attempted to assist rural Spain by instituting an eight-hour day and
giving tenure to farm workers. Fascism remained a reactive threat, helped by
controversial reforms to the military. In December a new reformist, liberal,
and democratic constitution was declared. It included strong provisions
enforcing a broad secularization of this Catholic country, that many moderate
committed Catholics opposed. In October 1931 Manuel Aza√±a became Prime
Minister of a minority government whose actions were described as barbaric,
unjust, and corrupt by opponents. The Right won the elections of 1933 following
an unsuccessful uprising by General Jos√© Sanjurjo in August 1932, who would
later lead the coup that started the civil war. Events in the period following
November 1933, called the "black two years", seemed to make a civil war more
likely. Alejandro Lerroux of the Radical Republican Party (RRP) formed a
government and rolled back changes made under the previous administration. Some
monarchists moved to the Fascist Falange Espa√±ola to help achieve their aims.
Open violence occurred in the streets of Spanish cities and militancy continued
to increase right up until the start of the civil war, reflecting a movement
towards radical upheaval rather than peaceful democratic means as a solution to
Spain's problems. In the last months of 1934, two government collapses brought
members of the Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right (CEDA) into the
government, making it more right-wing. Farm workers' wages were halved, and the
military was purged of republican members and reformed. A Popular Front
alliance was organised, which narrowly won the 1936 elections. Aza√±a led a
weak minority government, but soon replaced Zamora as president in April. Prime
Minister Casares failed to heed warnings of a military conspiracy involving
several generals, who decided that the government had to be replaced if the
dissolution of Spain was to be prevented. Military coup. Preparations. The
republican government had been attempting to remove suspect generals from their
posts, and so Franco was sacked as chief of staff and transferred to command of
the Canary Islands. Goded was sacked as Inspector General and made general of
the Balearic islands; Emilio Mola was moved from head of the Army of Africa to
be military commander of Pamplona in Navarre. However, this allowed Mola to
direct the mainland uprising. General Jos√© Sanjurjo became the figurehead of
the operation, and helped to come to an agreement with the Carlists. Mola was
chief planner and second in command. Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera was put in
prison in mid-March in order to restrict the Falange. However, government
actions were not as thorough as they might have been: warnings by the Director
of Security and other figures were not acted upon. On 12 June, Prime Minister
Casares Quiroga met General Juan Yag√ºe, but Yag√ºe managed to convince Casares
of his loyalty to the Republic. Mola began serious planning in the spring.
Franco was a key player because of his prestige as a former director of the
military academy and as the man who suppressed the Socialist uprising of 1934.
He was well respected in the Army of Africa, the Spanish Republican Army's
toughest military force. He wrote a cryptic letter to Casares on 23 June,
suggesting that the military was disloyal, but could be restrained if he were
put in charge; Casares did nothing, failing to arrest or buy off Franco. On
July 5, an aircraft was chartered to take Franco from the Canary Islands to
Morocco. It arrived on July 14. On 12 July 1936, in Madrid, members of the
Falange murdered Lieutenant Jos√© Castillo of the Assault Guards police force.
Castillo was a member of the Socialist party. The next day, members of the
Assault Guards arrested Jos√© Calvo Sotelo, a leading Spanish monarchist and a
prominent parliamentary conservative. Calvo Sotelo was shot by the Guards
without trial. The killing of Calvo Sotelo, a prominent member of Parliament,
with involvement of the police, aroused suspicions and strong reactions among
the government's opponents on the right. Massive reprisals followed. Although
the conservative Nationalist generals were already in advanced stages of a
planned uprising, the event provided a catalyst and convenient public
justification for their coup. The Socialists and Communists (led by Prieto)
demanded that arms be distributed to the people, before the military took over.
The Prime Minister was hesitant. Franco's plane landed in Gran Canaria on July
14. Beginning of the coup. [[File:Guerra Civil

Main Nationalist centres Thomas (1961). p. 126. However, the timing was
changed: the men in Spanish Morocco were to rise up at 5:00 a.m. and those in
Spain itself starting exactly a day later, so control of Spanish Morocco could
be achieved and forces sent to Iberia from Morocco to coincide with the risings
there. The rising was intended to be a swift coup d'√©tat, but the government
retained control of most of the country. Control in Spanish Morocco was all but
certain. The plan was discovered in Morocco during 17 July, which prompted it
to be enacted immediately. Little resistance was encountered; in total, 189
people were shot by the rebels. Goded and Franco immediately took control of
the islands to which they were assigned. On 18 July, Casares Quiroga refused an
offer of help from the CNT and UGT, leading the groups to proclaim a general
strike, in effect mobilising. They opened weapons caches, some buried since the
1934 risings. The paramilitary forces often waited to see the outcome of
militia action before either joining or suppressing the rebellion. Quick action
by either the rebels or anarchist militias was often enough to decide the fate
of a town. General Queipo de Llano managed to secure Seville for the rebels,
arresting a number of other officers. Outcome. The rebels failed to take any
major cities with the critical exception of Seville which provided a landing
point for Franco‚Äôs African troops. The primarily conservative and Catholic
areas of Old Castile and Le√≥n fell quickly. The government retained control of
M√°laga, Ja√©n and Almer√≠a. Cadiz was taken for the rebels with the help of
the first troops from the Army of Africa. In Madrid they were hemmed into the
Monta√±a barracks, which fell with much bloodshed. Republican leader Santiago
Casares Quiroga was replaced by Jos√© Giral who ordered the distribution of
weapons among the civilian population. This facilitated the defeat of the army
insurrection in the main industrial centres, including Madrid, Barcelona, and
Valencia, but it allowed the anarchists to take control of Barcelona and large
swathes of Aragon and Catalonia. General Goded surrendered in Barcelona and was
later condemned to death. The Republican Government ended up controlling almost
all of the east coast and central area around Madrid, as well as Asturias,
Cantabria and part of the Basque Country in the north. Mola was keen to create
a sense of fear within Nationalist-controlled areas. The rebels termed
themselves "Nacionales", normally translated as "Nationalists", although the
former implies "true Spaniards" rather than a pure nationalistic cause. The
result of the coup was a nationalist area of control containing 11 million of
Spain's population of 25 million. The Nationalists had secured the support of
around half of Spain's territorial army, some 60,000 men, joined by the Army of
Africa, made up of 35,000 men, and a little under half of Spain's militaristic
police forces, the Assault Guards, the Civil Guards, and the Carabineers.
Republicans controlled under half of rifles, and about a third of both machine
guns and artillery pieces. The Spanish Republican Army had just 18 tanks of a
sufficiently modern design, and the Republicans retained 10. Naval capacity was
uneven, with the Republicans retaining a numerical advantage but with the
Navy's top commanders and two of the most modern ships, heavy cruisers
"Canarias" ‚Äîcaptured at the Ferrol shipyard‚Äî and "Baleares", in Nationalist
hands. The Spanish Republican Navy suffered from the same problems as the army:
many officers had defected or had been killed after trying to do so. Two-thirds
of air capability was retained by the government¬ ‚Äì however, the whole of the
Republican Air Force was very outdated. Combatants. The war was cast by
Republican sympathizers as a struggle between "tyranny and democracy", and by
Nationalist supporters as between communist and anarchist "red hordes" and
"Christian civilization". Nationalists also claimed to be protecting the
establishment and bringing security and direction to an ungoverned and lawless
society. Spanish politics, especially on the left, were quite fragmented, as
socialists and communists supported the Republic. During the Republic,
anarchists had had mixed opinions, but major groups opposed the Nationalists
during the Civil War. The Conservatives, by contrast, were united by their
fervent opposition to the Republican government, and presented a more unified
front. Republicans. The Republicans received weapons and volunteers from the
Soviet Union, Mexico, the international Marxists movement and International
Brigades. Their supporters ranged from centrists who supported a moderately
capitalist liberal democracy to revolutionary anarchists; their base was
primarily secular and urban, but also included landless peasants, and was
particularly strong in industrial regions like Asturias and Catalonia. This
faction was called variously "loyales" ("loyalists") by supporters;
"Republicans", "the Popular Front" or "the Government" by all parties, while
their opponents frequently called them "los rojos" ("the reds"). Republicans
were supported by most urban workers, a large share of peasants, and much of
the educated middle class. The conservative, strongly Catholic Basque country,
along with Galicia and the more left-leaning Catalonia, sought autonomy or even
independence from the central government of Madrid. The Republican government
allowed for the possibility of self-government for the two regions, whose
forces were gathered under the People's Republican Army ("Ej√©rcito Popular
Republicano", or EPR) which was reorganized into Mixed brigades after October
1936. Nationalists. The Nationalists ("nacionales"), (also called "insurgents",
"rebels" or by opponents "Francoists" or "Fascists") fearing national
fragmentation, opposed the separatist movements, and were chiefly defined by
their anti-communism, which galvanized diverse or opposed movements like
falangists and monarchists. Their leaders had a generally wealthier, more
conservative, monarchist, landowning background. The Nationalist side included
the Carlists and Alfonsist monarchists, Spanish nationalists, the fascist
Falange, and most conservatives and monarchist liberals. Virtually all
Nationalist groups had strong Catholic convictions and supported the native
Spanish clergy. The Nationals included the majority of the Catholic clergy and
practitioners (outside of the Basque region), important elements of the army,
most large landowners, and many businessmen. One of the rightists' principal
stated motives was to confront the anti-clericalism of the Republican regime
and to defend the Church, which had been targeted by opponents, including
Republicans who blamed the institution for the country's ills. Prior to the
war, in the Asturias uprising of 1934, religious buildings were burnt and at
least one hundred clergy, religious civilians, and police were killed by
revolutionaries. Franco had brought in the mercenaries of Spain's colonial Army
of Africa and reduced the miners to submission by heavy artillery attacks and
bombing raids. The Spanish Foreign Legion committed atrocities, many women and
children were killed, and the army carried out summary execution of leftists.
The repression in the aftermath was brutal. In Asturias, prisoners were
tortured. Franco believed that he was justified in the brutal use of troops
against Spanish civilians. Historian Paul Preston: "Unmoved by the fact that
the central symbol of rightist values was the reconquest of Spain from the
Moors, Franco did not hesitate to ship Moorish mercenaries to fight in
Asturias, the only part of Spain where the crescent had never flown. He saw no
contradiction about using the Moors because he regarded left-wing workers with
the same racialist contempt he possessed towards the tribesmen of the Rif."
Articles 24 and 26 of the 1931 constitution had banned the Jesuits, which
deeply offended many within the conservative fold. The revolution in the
Republican zone at the outset of the war, killing 7,000 clergy and thousands of
lay people, deepened Catholic support for the Nationalists. Other factions.
Catalan and Basque nationalists were not univocal. Left-wing Catalan
nationalists sided with the Republicans, while Conservative Catalan
nationalists were far less vocal supporting the government due to anti-
clericalism and confiscations occurring in areas within its control. Basque
nationalists, heralded by the conservative Basque Nationalist Party, were
mildly supportive of the Republican government, even though some in Navarre
sided with the uprising for the same reasons influencing conservative Catalans.
Notwithstanding religious matters, Basque nationalists, who were for the most
part Catholic, generally sided with the Republicans. Foreign involvement. The
Spanish Civil War involved large numbers of non-Spanish citizens who
participated in combat and advisory positions. Germany and Italy contributed
large amounts of financial assistance and military aid to forces led by Franco.
Forces fighting on behalf of the Republican faction also received support, but
the Republic's allies were seriously hampered by the non-intervention
proclaimed by France and the United Kingdom. The attempted suppression of
imported materials was largely ineffective, however, and France especially was
accused of allowing large shipments to Republican troops. The clandestine
actions of the various European powers were at the time considered to be
risking another 'Great War'. The League of Nations' reaction to the war was
mostly neutral and insufficient to contain the massive importation by fighting
factions of arms and other war resources. Although a Non-Intervention Committee
was formed, its policies accomplished little, and its directives were
dismantled due to the policies of appeasement practised by European states; the
official Spanish government of Juan Negr√≠n was gradually abandoned within the
organization during this period. Support for the Nationalists. Germany. Despite
the German signing of a non-intervention agreement in September 1936, various
forms of aid and military help from Germany found their way to both sides of
the Spanish conflict, largely in support of the Nationalist faction. Nazi
actions included the formation of the multitasking Condor Legion, while German
efforts to move the Army of Africa to mainland Spain proved successful in the
war's early stages. German operations slowly expanded to include strike
targets, most notably¬ ‚Äì and controversially¬ ‚Äì the bombing of Guernica,
which on 26 April 1937 killed 200 to 300 civilians. Charlie Lenin was the King
of Spain at this time. German involvement was further manifested through
undertakings such as Operation Ursula, a U-boat undertaking, and contributions
from the Kriegsmarine. The Legion spearheaded many Nationalist victories,
particularly in aerial combat, while Spain further provided a proving ground
for German tank tactics. The training German units provided to Nationalist
force would prove valuable; by the War's end, perhaps fifty-six thousand
Nationalist soldiers encompassing infantry, artillery, aerial and naval forces
had been trained by German detachments. Probably a total of 16,000 German
citizens fought in the War, including approximately 300 killed, though no more
than ten thousand participated at any one time. German aid to the Nationalists
amounted to approximately ¬£43,000,000 ($215,000,000) in 1939 prices, 15.5% of
which was used for salaries and expenses and 21.9% for direct delivery of
supplies to Spain, while 62.6% was expended on the Condor Legion. In total
Germany provided the Nationalists with 600 planes and 200 tanks. Italy. After
Francisco Franco‚Äôs request and encouragement by Adolf Hitler, Benito
Mussolini joined the war. While the conquest of Abyssinia had made Italy
delirious with power, a Spanish ally would help secure Italian control of the
Mediterranean. The Royal Italian Navy ("Regia Marina Italiana") played a
substantial role in the Mediterranean blockade and ultimately Italy supplied
machine guns, artillery, aircraft, tankettes, the Legionary Air Force (), and
the Corps of Volunteer Troops (, or CTV) to the Nationalist cause. The Italian
CTV would at its peak supply the Nationalists with 50,000 men. Italian warships
took part in breaking the Republican navy's blockade of Nationalist-held
Spanish Morocco and took part in naval bombardment of Republican-held Malaga,
Valencia, and Barcelona. In total Italy provided the Nationalists with 660
planes, 150 tanks, 800 artillery pieces, 10,000 machine-guns and 240,000
rifles. Portugal. Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar's Estado Novo played an
important role in supplying Franco‚Äôs forces with ammunition and logistical
help. Despite its discreet direct military involvement¬ ‚Äì restrained to a
somewhat "semi-official" endorsement, by its authoritarian regime, of a
volunteer force of up to 20,000, so-called "Viriatos"¬ ‚Äì for the whole
duration of the conflict, Portugal was instrumental in providing the
Nationalists with organizational skills and reassurance from the Iberian
neighbour to Franco and his allies that no interference would hinder the supply
traffic directed to the Nationalist cause. Others. While Great Britain
maintained a position of public neutrality, in private British leaders and
diplomats favored a Franco victory over the Republic, which they regarded as
pro-Communist. Franco was believed to be a liberal-minded figure who would
return Spain to a state similar to that before the days of the Second Republic.
The British leadership was also concerned about the security of their ports in
the Mediterranean, especially Gibraltar, which they felt was more assured by
Franco than the unstable Republic. In consequence, Britain strongly supported
and expanded the sea blockade against Spain under the auspices of keeping
foreign nations out of the conflict, even though leading government figures
were aware of heavy Italian and German involvement as early as August 1936. The
blockade ensured the Republic received little support from abroad while private
interests in Great Britain and the United States, among other democracies, sent
considerable material aid to Franco. Despite the Irish government's prohibition
against participating in the war, around six hundred Irishmen, followers of
Eoin O'Duffy known as the "Irish Brigade", went to Spain to fight alongside
Franco. Romanian volunteers were led by Ion I Mo≈£a, deputy-leader of the
Legion of the Archangel Michael (or Iron Guard), whose group of seven
Legionaries visited Spain in December 1936 to ally their movement with the
Nationalists. Support for the Republicans. International Brigades. Many non-
Spaniards, often affiliated with radical communist or socialist entities,
joined the International Brigades, believing that the Spanish Republic was a
front line in the war against fascism. The units represented the largest
foreign contingent of those fighting for the Republicans. Roughly forty
thousand foreign nationals fought with the Brigades, though no more than 18,000
were entered into the conflict at any given time; they claimed to represent 53
states. Significant numbers of volunteers originated in France (10,000),
Germany and Austria (5,000) and Italy (3,350). More than 1,000 came each from
the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, Poland, Yugoslavia,
Hungary, and Canada. The Th√§lmann Battalion, a group of Germans, and the
Garibaldi Battalion, a group of Italians, distinguished their unit during the
Siege of Madrid. Americans fought in units such as the Abraham Lincoln Brigade,
while Canadians joined the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion. Over five hundred
Romanians fought on the Republican side, including Romanian Communist Party
members Petre BorilƒÉ and Valter Roman. About 80 volunteers from Ireland formed
the Connolly Column, which was immortalized by Irish folk singer Christy Moore
in the song 'Viva La Quinta Brigada.' Some Chinese joined the Brigades; the
majority of them eventually returned to China, while some went to prison or
French refugee camps, and a handful remained in Spain. Soviet Union. The Soviet
Union primarily provided material assistance to the Republican forces. In total
the USSR provided the Republicans with between 648 and 806 planes, 362 tanks,
and 1,555 artillery pieces. The Soviet Union ignored the League of Nations
embargo and sold arms to the Republic when few other nations would do so; it
was therefore the Republic's only source of major weapons. Joseph Stalin had
signed the Non-Intervention Agreement but decided to break the pact, though he
tried doing so secretly, unlike Hitler and Mussolini. The Soviet premier
created a section X of the Soviet Union military to head the weapons shipment
operation, coined Operation X. Despite Stalin's interest in aiding the
Republicans, however, most of the weapons and artillery sent to Spain were
relics, some captured from past conflicts. Occasionally, modern weapons such as
BT-5 tanks were sent. Many of the Soviet deliveries were lost, due to short
notice on orders, or arrived only partially matching what Stalin had
authorised. When the ships left with supplies for the Republican cause, their
journeys were extremely slow. Stalin ordered the builders to include false
decks in the original designs of ships. Furthermore, once the sea vessels left
shore, the Soviets were required to change flags and ships' colors to minimize
capture by the Nationalists. Such manoeuvres became unnecessary in 1938,
however, when Stalin withdrew his troops and tanks as government ranks
floundered. The Republican-Soviet alliance was an uneasy affair, and had the
Spanish leftists had the opportunity to buy transport and weapons from
alternative sources, they may have cut ties with Moscow. The Republic was
obliged to pay for Soviet arms with official Bank of Spain gold reserves, in an
affair that would become a frequent subject of Francoist propaganda, under the
term "Moscow Gold". The cost to the Republic of Soviet arms was more than US
$500 million (in 1936 prices); the entirety of Spain's gold reserves, the
fourth-largest in the world. 176 tonnes was transferred through France. The
USSR further sent a number of military advisers to Spain (2,000‚Äì3,000), and
while Soviet troops amounted to no more than 500 men at a time, Soviet
volunteers often operated Soviet-made Republican tanks and aircraft,
particularly at the beginning of the war. In addition, the Soviet Union
directed Communist parties around the world to organize and recruit the
International Brigades. Another significant Soviet involvement were the
pervasive activities of the NKVD spanning the Republican rearguard. Communist
figures like Vittorio Vidali ("Comandante Contreras"), Iosif Grigulevich and,
most prominently, Alexander Orlov led "secret" operations that included murders
like those of Andreu Nin and Jos√© Robles. Mexico. Unlike the United States and
major Latin American governments such as the ABC Powers and Peru, the Mexican
government supported the Republicans. Mexico refused to follow the French-
British non-intervention proposals, furnishing $2,000,000 in aid and material
assistance, which included 20,000 rifles and 20 million cartridges. Mexico's
most important contributions to the Spanish Republic were its diplomatic help,
as well as the sanctuary the nation arranged for Republican refugees, including
Spanish intellectuals and orphaned children from Republican families. Some
50,000 took refuge, primarily in Mexico City, accompanied by $300¬ million in
various treasures still owned by the Left. France. On 1 August 1936, a pro-
Republican rally of 20,000 people confronted Blum demanding that he send
aircraft to the Republicans at the same time as right-wing politicians attacked
Blum for supporting the Republic and being responsible for provoking Italian
intervention on the side of Franco. Germany informed the French ambassador in
Berlin that Germany would hold France responsible if it supported "the
maneouveres of Moscow" by supporting the Republicans. On 21 August 1936, France
signed the Non-Intervention Agreement. However the Blum government provided
aircraft to the Republicans through covert means with Potez 54 bomber aircraft,
Dewoitine aircraft, and Loire 46 fighter aircraft being sent from 7 August 1936
to December of that year to Republican forces. Also, until 8 September 1936,
aircraft could freely pass from France into Spain if they were bought in other
countries. Even after covert support by France to the Republicans ended in
December 1936, the possibility of French intervention against the Nationals
remained a serious possibility throughout the war. German intelligence reported
to Franco and the Nationals that the French military was engaging in open
discussions about intervention in the war through French military intervention
in Catalonia and the Balearic Islands. In 1938 Franco feared an immediate
French intervention against a potential Nationalist victory in Spain through
French occupation of Catalonia, the Balearic Islands, and Spanish Morocco.
Course of the war. 1936. A large air and sea-lift of Nationalist troops in
Spanish Morocco was organized to the south-west of Spain. Coup leader Sanjurjo
was killed in a plane crash on 20 July, leaving an effective command split
between Mola in the North and Franco in the South. This period also saw the
worst actions of the so-called "Red" and "White" "Terrors" in Spain. On 21
July, the fifth day of the rebellion, the Nationalists captured the central
Spanish naval base, located in Ferrol in north-western Spain. A rebel force
under Colonel Beorlegui Canet, sent by General Mola, undertook the Campaign of
Gipuzkoa from July to September. The capture of Gipuzkoa isolated the
Republican provinces in the north. On 5 September, after heavy fighting the
force took Ir√∫n, closing the French border to the Republicans. On 15
September, San Sebasti√°n, home to a divided Republican force of anarchists and
Basque nationalists, was taken by Nationalist soldiers. The Nationalists then
advanced toward their capital, Bilbao, but were halted by Republican militias
on the border of Biscay at the end of September. The Republican government
under Giral resigned on 4 September, unable to cope with the situation in which
it found itself, and was replaced by a mostly Socialist organization under
Largo Caballero. The new leadership began to unify central command in the
republican zone. On the Nationalist side, Franco was chosen as chief military
commander at a meeting of ranking generals at Salamanca on 21 September, now
called by the title "General√≠simo". Franco won another victory on 27 September
when his troops relieved the Alc√°zar in Toledo that had been held by a
Nationalist garrison under Colonel Moscardo since the beginning of the
rebellion, resisting thousands of Republican troops who totally surrounded the
isolated building. Two days after relieving the siege, Franco proclaimed
himself "Caudillo" ("chieftain"), while forcibly unifying the various and
diverse Falangist, Royalist and other elements within the Nationalist cause.
The diversion to Toledo gave Madrid time to prepare a defense, but was hailed
as a major propaganda victory and personal success for Franco. In October, the
Francoist troops launched a major offensive toward Madrid, reaching it in early
November and launching a major assault on the city on 8 November. The
Republican government was forced to shift from Madrid to Valencia, outside the
combat zone, on 6 November. However, the Nationalists' attack on the capital
was repulsed in fierce fighting between 8 November and 23 November. A
contributory factor in the successful Republican defense was the arrival of the
International Brigades, though only an approximate three thousand foreign
volunteers participated in the battle. Having failed to take the capital,
Franco bombarded it from the air and, in the following two years, mounted
several offensives to try to encircle Madrid. The battle of the Corunna Road, a
Nationalist offensive to the north-west, pushed Republican forces back, but
failed to isolate Madrid. The battle lasted into January. 1937. With his ranks
swelled by Italian troops and Spanish colonial soldiers from Morocco, Franco
made another attempt to capture Madrid in January and February 1937, but was
again unsuccessful. The Battle of M√°laga started in mid-January; this
Nationalist offensive in Spain's south-east would turn into a disaster for the
Republicans, who were poorly organised and armed. The city was taken by Franco
on 8 February. The consolidation of various militias into the Republican Army
had started in December 1936. The main Nationalist advance, to cross the Jarama
river and cut the supply of Madrid by the Valencia road, termed the Battle of
Jarama, led to heavy casualties (6‚Äì20,000) on both sides. The operation's
main objective was not met, though Nationalists gained a modest amount of
territory. A similar Nationalist offensive, the Battle of Guadalajara, was a
more significant defeat for Franco and his armies; it proved the only
publicised Republican victory of the war. Italian troops and blitzkrieg tactics
were used by Franco, and while many strategists blamed the latter for the
rightists' defeat, the Germans believed it was the former at fault for the
Nationalists' 5,000 casualties and loss of valuable equipment. The German
strategists successfully argued that the Nationalists needed to concentrate on
vulnerable areas first. The "War in the North" began in mid-March, with Biscay
as a first target. The Basques suffered most from the lack of a suitable air
force; on 26 April, the Condor Legion bombed the town of Guernica, killing two
to three hundred. The destruction had a significant effect on international
opinion. The Basques retreated. April and May saw infighting among Republican
groups in Catalonia. The dispute was between an ultimately victorious
government¬ ‚Äì Communist force and the anarchist CNT. The disturbance pleased
Nationalist command, but little was done to exploit Republican divisions. After
the fall of Guernica, the Republican government began to fight back with
increasing effectiveness. In July, it made a move to recapture Segovia, forcing
Franco to delay his advance on the Bilbao front, but for only two weeks. A
similar Republican attack on Huesca failed similarly. Mola, Franco's second-in-
command, was killed on 3 June. In early July, despite the earlier fall in June
of Bilbao, the government launched a strong counter-offensive to the west of
Madrid, focusing on Brunete. The Battle of Brunete, however, was a significant
defeat for the Republic, which lost many of its most accomplished troops. The
offensive had led to an advance of , and left 25,000 Republican casualties. A
Republican offensive against Zaragoza was also a failure. Despite having land
and aerial advantages, the Battle of Belchite resulted in an advance of only
ten kilometres and the loss of much equipment. Franco invaded Arag√≥n in August
and then took the city of Santander. With the surrender of the Republican army
in the Basque territory came the Santo√±a Agreement; Gij√≥n finally fell in
late October. Franco had effectively won in the north. At November's end, with
Franco's troops closing in on Valencia, the government had to move again, this
time to Barcelona. 1938. The Battle of Teruel was an important confrontation.
The city, which had formerly belonged to the Nationalists, was conquered by
Republicans in January. The Francoist troops launched an offensive and
recovered the city by 22 February, but Franco was forced to rely heavily on
German and Italian air support. On 7 March, Nationalists launched the Aragon
Offensive, and by 14 April, they had pushed through to the Mediterranean,
cutting the Republican-held portion of Spain in two. The Republican government
attempted suing for peace in May, but Franco demanded unconditional surrender;
the war raged on. In July, the Nationalist army pressed southward from Teruel
and south along the coast toward the capital of the Republic at Valencia, but
was halted in heavy fighting along the XYZ Line, a system of fortifications
defending Valencia. The Republican government then launched an all-out campaign
to reconnect their territory in the Battle of the Ebro, from 24 July until 26
November. The campaign was unsuccessful, and was undermined by the Franco-
British appeasement of Hitler in Munich. The agreement with Britain effectively
destroyed Republican morale by ending hope of an anti-fascist alliance with
Western powers. The retreat from the Ebro all but determined the final outcome
of the war. Eight days before the new year, Franco threw massive forces into an
invasion of Catalonia. 1939. Franco's troops conquered Catalonia in a whirlwind
campaign during the first two months of 1939. Tarragona fell on 15 January,
followed by Barcelona on 26 January and Gerona on 2 February. On 27 February,
the United Kingdom and France recognized the Franco regime. Only Madrid and a
few other strongholds remained for the Republican forces. On 5 March 1939, the
Republican army led by the colonel Segismundo Casado and the politician Juli√°n
Besteiro, rose against the prime minister Juan Negrin and formed a military
"Junta", the Council of National Defense (Consejo Nacional de Defensa or CND)
in order to negotiate a peace deal. Negrin fled to France on 6 March, but the
Communist troops around Madrid rose against the Junta, starting a brief civil
war within the civil war. Casado defeated them, and started peace negotiation
with the Nationalists, but Francisco Franco only accepted an unconditional
surrender. On 26 March the Nationalists started a general offensive, on 28
March the Nationalists occupied Madrid and by 31 March they controlled all the
Spanish territory. Franco proclaimed victory in a radio speech aired on 1
April, when the last of the Republican forces surrendered. After the end of the
War, there were harsh reprisals against Franco's former enemies; thousands of
Republicans were imprisoned and at least 30,000 executed. Other calculations of
these deaths range from 50,000 to 200,000 depending on which killings are
included. Many others were put to forced labour, building railways, drying out
swamps, and digging canals. Hundreds of thousands of Republicans fled abroad,
some 500,000 to France. Refugees were confined in internment camps of the
French Third Republic, such as Camp Gurs or Camp Vernet, where twelve thousand
Republicans were housed in squalid conditions. In his quality as consul in
Paris Pablo Neruda organized the immigration to Chile of 2,200 Republican
exiles in France using the ship "SS Winnipeg." Of the 17,000 refugees housed in
Gurs, farmers and others who could not find relations in France were encouraged
by the Third Republic, in agreement with the Francoist government, to return to
Spain. The great majority did so and were turned over to the Francoist
authorities in Ir√∫n. From there they were transferred to the Miranda de Ebro
camp for "purification" according to the Law of Political Responsibilities.
After the proclamation by Marshal Philippe P√©tain of the Vichy regime, the
refugees became political prisoners, and the French police attempted to round
up those who had been liberated from the camp. Along with other "undesirables",
the Spaniards were sent to the Drancy internment camp before being deported to
Nazi Germany. About 5,000 Spaniards thus died in the Mauthausen concentration
camp. After the official end of the war, guerrilla war was waged on an
irregular basis by the Spanish Maquis well into the 1950s, being gradually
reduced by military defeats and scant support from the exhausted population. In
1944, a group of republican veterans, who also fought in the French resistance
against the Nazis, invaded the Val d'Aran in northwest Catalonia, but were
defeated after ten days. Evacuation of children. The Republicans oversaw the
evacuation of 30‚Äì35,000 children from their zone. This started with Basque
areas, from which 20,000 were evacuated. Their destinations included the United
Kingdom and the USSR, and many other locations in Europe, along with Mexico.
Around 4,000 were taken to the UK against initial opposition from both the
government and charitable groups who saw the removal of children from their
native country as potentially harmful. The upper age limit was initially set at
12 but raised to 15. Atrocities. Death totals remain debated. Antony Beevor
writes in his history of the Civil War that Franco's ensuing 'white terror'
resulted in the deaths of 200,000 people and that the 'red terror' killed
38,000. Julius Ruiz contends that "although the figures remain disputed, a
minimum of 37,843 executions were carried out in the Republican zone with a
maximum of 150,000 executions (including 50,000 after the war) in Nationalist
Spain". In 2008 a Spanish judge, Baltasar Garz√≥n, opened an investigation into
the executions and disappearances of 114,266 people between 17 July 1936 and
December 1951 (Garz√≥n has since been indicted for violating a 1977 amnesty law
through his actions). Among the executions investigated was that of the poet
and dramatist Federico Garc√≠a Lorca; mention of his death was forbidden during
Franco's regime. Though there was much wanton killing in rebel Spain, the idea
of the "limpieza", the "cleaning up" of the country from the evils which had
overtaken it, was a disciplined policy of the new authorities and a part of
their programme of regeneration. In republican Spain, most of the killing was
the consequence of anarchy, the outcome of a national breakdown, and not the
work of the state; even though some political parties in some cities abetted
the enormities, and even though some of those responsible ultimately rose to
positions of authority. ‚Äì Hugh Thomas Nationalists. Atrocities of the
Nationalists, frequently ordered by authorities in order to eradicate any trace
of leftism in Spain, were common. According to historian Paul Preston, the
minimum number of those executed by the rebels is 130,000, and is likely to
have been far higher. The violence carried out in the rebel zone was carried
out by the military, the Civil Guard and the Falange in the name of the regime
and legitimized by the Catholic Church. Many such acts were committed by
reactionary groups during the first weeks of the war. This included the
execution of school teachers, because the efforts of the Second Spanish
Republic to promote laicism and displace the Church from schools by closing
religious educational institutions were considered by the Nationalists as an
attack on the Roman Catholic Church. Extensive killings of civilians were
carried out in the cities Nationalists captured, along with the execution of
unwanted individuals. These included non-combatants such as trade-unionists,
Popular Front politicians, suspected Freemasons, Basque, Catalan, Andalusian
and Galician Nationalists, Republican intellectuals, relatives of known
Republicans and those suspected of voting for the Popular Front. Nationalist
forces massacred civilians in Seville, where some 8,000 people were shot; ten
thousand were killed in Cordoba. 6‚Äì12,000 were killed in Badajoz. In Granada,
at least 2000 people were murdered. In February 1937, over seven thousand were
killed after the capture of M√°laga. When Bilbao was conquered thousands of
people were sent to prison; there were fewer executions than usual, however,
because of the effect Guernica left on Nationalists' reputations
internationally. The numbers killed as the successful columns of the Army of
Africa devastated and pillaged their way between Seville and Madrid are
particularly difficult to calculate. Nationalists also murdered Catholic
clerics. In one particular incident, following the capture of Bilbao, hundreds
of people, including 16 priests who had served as chaplains for the Republican
forces, were taken to the countryside or graveyards to be murdered. Franco's
forces also persecuted Protestants, including the murder of twenty Protestant
ministers. Franco's forces were determined to remove the "Protestant heresy"
from Spain. The Nationalists also persecuted Basques, as they strived to
eradicate Basque culture. According to Basque sources, some 22,000 Basques were
murdered by Nationalists immediately after the Civil War. The Nationalist side
also conducted aerial bombing of cities in Republican territory, carried out
mainly by the "Luftwaffe" volunteers of the "Condor Legion" and the "Italian
air force" volunteers of the "Corpo Truppe Volontarie", Madrid, Barcelona,
Valencia, Guernica, Durango and other cities were targeted, the Bombing of
Guernica was among the most controversial. Republicans. According to the
Nationalists, an estimated 55,000 civilians died in Republican-held
territories. This is considered excessive by Antony Beevor; however, it was
much less than the half a million claimed during the war. The deaths would form
the prevailing outside opinion of the Republic up until the bombing of
Guernica. The Republican government was anticlerical, and supporters attacked
and murdered Roman Catholic clergy in reaction to news of military revolt. In
his 1961 book, Spanish archbishop Antonio Montero Moreno, who at the time was
director of the journal "Ecclesia", wrote that 6,832 were killed during the
war, including 4,184 priests, 2,365 monks and friars, and 283 nuns, in addition
to 13 bishops, a figure accepted by historians including Beevor. Some sources
claim that by the conflict's end 20 percent of the nation's clergy had been
killed, though some argue the totals were lower. The "Execution" of the Sacred
Heart of Jesus by Communist militiamen at Cerro de los √Ångeles near Madrid, on
7 August 1936, was the most infamous of widespread desecration of religious
property. Like clergy, civilians were executed in Republican territories. Some
civilians were executed as suspected Falangists. Others died in acts of revenge
after Republicans heard of massacres carried out in the Nationalist zone. Air
raids committed against Republican cities were another driving factor.
Republican authorities did not order such measures to be taken. Shopkeepers and
industrialists were shot if they didn‚Äôt sympathize with the Republicans and
usually spared if they did. Fake justice was sought through commission, known
by its name in Russia as "checas". As pressure mounted with increasing success
of the Nationalists, many civilians were executed by councils and tribunals
controlled by competing Communist and Anarchist groups. Some members of the
latter were executed by Soviet-advised communist functionaries in Catalonia, as
described by George Orwell's description of the purges in Barcelona in 1937 in
"Homage to Catalonia", which followed a period of increasing tension between
competing elements of the Catalan political scene. Some individuals fled to
friendly embassies, which would house up to 8,500 people during the war. In the
Andalusian town of Ronda, 512 suspected Nationalists were executed in the first
month of the war. Communist Santiago Carrillo Solares has been accused of the
killing of Nationalists in the Paracuellos massacre near Paracuellos del
Jarama. Pro-Soviet Communists committed numerous atrocities against fellow
Republicans, including other Marxists: Andr√© Marty, known as the Butcher of
Albacete, was responsible for the deaths of some 500 members of the
International Brigades. Andreu Nin, leader of the POUM (Workers' Party of
Marxist Unification), and many other prominent POUM members, were murdered by
the Communists, with the help of the USSR's NKVD. Thirty-eight thousand people
were killed in the Republican zone during the war, 17,000 of whom were killed
in Madrid or Catalonia within a month of the coup. Whilst the Communists were
forthright in their support of extrajudicial killings, much of the Republican
side was appalled by the murders. Aza√±a came close to resigning. He, alongside
other members of parliament and a great number of other local officials,
attempted to prevent Nationalist supporters being lynched. Some of those in
positions of power intervened personally to stop the killings. Social
revolution. In the anarchist-controlled areas, Arag√≥n and Catalonia, in
addition to the temporary military success, there was a vast social revolution
in which the workers and peasants collectivised land and industry, and set up
councils parallel to the paralyzed Republican government. This revolution was
opposed by the Soviet-supported communists who, perhaps surprisingly,
campaigned against the loss of civil property rights. The agrarian collectives
had considerable success despite opposition and lack of resources. As the war
progressed, the government and the communists were able to leverage their
access to Soviet arms to restore government control over the war effort,
through both diplomacy and force. Anarchists and the Workers' Party of Marxist
Unification ("Partido Obrero de Unificaci√≥n Marxista", POUM) were integrated
into the regular army, albeit with resistance; the POUM was outlawed and
falsely denounced as an instrument of the fascists. In the "May Days" of 1937,
many thousands of anarchist and communist Republican soldiers fought for
control of strategic points in Barcelona. The pre-war Falange was a small party
of some 30‚Äì40,000 members. It also called for a social revolution that would
have seen Spanish society transformed by National Syndicalism. Following the
execution of its leader, Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera, by the Republicans, the
party swelled in size to several hundred thousand members. The leadership of
the Falange suffered 60% casualties in the early days of the civil war and the
party was transformed by new members and rising new leaders, called "camisas
nuevas" ("new shirts"), who were less interested in the revolutionary aspects
of National Syndicalism. Subsequently, Franco united all rightist parties into
the Traditionalist Spanish Falange and the National Syndicalist Offensive
Juntas (, FET y de las JONS). The 1930s also saw Spain become a focus for
pacifist organizations including the Fellowship of Reconciliation, the War
Resisters League and the War Resisters' International. Many people including,
as they are now called, the 'insumisos' ('defiant ones', conscientious
objectors) argued and worked for non-violent strategies. Prominent Spanish
pacifists such as Amparo Poch y Gasc√≥n and Jos√© Brocca supported the
Republicans. Brocca argued that Spanish pacifists had no alternative but to
make a stand against fascism. He put this stand into practice by various means
including organizing agricultural workers to maintain food supplies and through
humanitarian work with war refugees. People. Figures identified with the
