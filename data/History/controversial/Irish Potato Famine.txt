Great Famine (Ireland) In Ireland, the Great Famine was a period of mass
starvation, disease and emigration between 1845 and 1852. It is also known,
mostly outside Ireland, as the Irish Potato Famine. In the Irish language it is
called "an Gorta MÃ³r" (, meaning "the Great Hunger") or "an Drochshaol" (,
meaning "the bad life"). During the famine approximately 1 million people died
and a million more emigrated from Ireland, causing the island's population to
fall by between 20% and 25%. The proximate cause of famine was a potato disease
commonly known as potato blight. Although blight ravaged potato crops
throughout Europe during the 1840s, the impact and human cost in Irelandwhere
one-third of the population was entirely dependent on the potato for foodwas
exacerbated by a host of political, social and economic factors which remain
the subject of historical debate. The famine was a watershed in the history of
Ireland. Its effects permanently changed the island's demographic, political
and cultural landscape. For both the native Irish and those in the resulting
diaspora, the famine entered folk memory and became a rallying point for
various nationalist movements as the whole island was then part of the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Modern historians regard it as a dividing
line in the Irish historical narrative, referring to the preceding period of
Irish history as "pre-Famine". Causes and contributing factors. Starting in
1801, Ireland had been directly governed, under the Act of Union, as part of
the United Kingdom. Executive power lay in the hands of the Lord Lieutenant of
Ireland and Chief Secretary for Ireland, both of whom were appointed by the
British government. Ireland sent 105 members of parliament to the House of
Commons of the United Kingdom, and Irish representative peers elected 28 of
their own number to sit for life in the House of Lords. Between 1832 and 1859,
70% of Irish representatives were landowners or the sons of landowners. In the
40 years that followed the union, successive British governments grappled with
the problems of governing a country which had, as Benjamin Disraeli put it in
1844, "a starving population, an absentee aristocracy, and an alien Church, and
in addition the weakest executive in the world." One historian calculated that
between 1801 and 1845, there had been 114 commissions and 61 special committees
enquiring into the state of Ireland and that "without exception their findings
prophesied disaster; Ireland was on the verge of starvation, her population
rapidly increasing, three-quarters of her labourers unemployed, housing
conditions appalling and the standard of living unbelievably low." Laws that
restricted the rights of Irish Catholics. In the 17th and 18th centuries, Irish
Catholics had been prohibited by the penal laws from owning land, from leasing
land; from voting, from holding political office; from living in a corporate
town or within of a corporate town, from obtaining education, from entering a
profession, and from doing many other things that are necessary in order to
succeed and prosper in life. The laws had largely been reformed by 1793, and in
1829, Irish Catholics could again sit in parliament following the Act of
Emancipation. Landlords and tenants. During the 18th century, a new system for
managing the landlord's property was introduced in the form of the "middleman
system". Rent collection was left in the hands of the landlords' agents, or
middlemen. This assured the (usually Protestant) landlord of a regular income,
and relieved them of any responsibility; the tenants however were then subject
to exploitation through these middlemen. Catholics made up 80% of the
population, the bulk of whom lived in conditions of poverty and insecurity
despite Catholic emancipation in 1829. At the top of the "social pyramid" was
the "ascendancy class", the English and Anglo-Irish families who owned most of
the land, and who had more or less limitless power over their tenants. Some of
their estates were vast: the Earl of Lucan owned over . Many of these landlords
lived in England and were called "absentee landlords". The rent revenue was
sent to England, collected from "impoverished tenants" paid minimal wages to
raise crops and livestock for export. In 1843, the British Government
considered that the land question in Ireland was the root cause of disaffection
in the country. They set up a Royal Commission, chaired by the Earl of Devon,
to enquire into the laws with regard to the occupation of land in Ireland.
Daniel O'Connell described this commission as perfectly one-sided, being made
up of landlords and no tenants. Devon in February 1845 reported that "It would
be impossible adequately to describe the privations which they labourer and his
family habitually and silently endure . . . in many districts their only food
is the potato, their only beverage water . . . their cabins are seldom a
protection against the weather... a bed or a blanket is a rare luxury . . . and
nearly in all their pig and a manure heap constitute their only property." The
Commissioners concluded that they could not "forbear expressing our strong
sense of the patient endurance which the labouring classes have exhibited under
sufferings greater, we believe, than the people of any other country in Europe
have to sustain." The Commission stated that the principal cause was the bad
relations between the landlord and tenant. There was no hereditary loyalty,
feudal tie or paternalism as existed in England. Ireland was a conquered
country, with the Earl of Clare speaking of the landlords saying "confiscation
is their common title." According to the historian Cecil Woodham-Smith, the
landlords regarded the land as a source of income from which to extract as much
money as possible. With the Irish "brooding over their discontent in sullen
indignation" according to the Earl of Clare, Ireland was seen as a hostile
place in which to live, and as a consequence absentee landlords were common,
with some visiting their property once or twice in a lifetime, or never. The
rents from Ireland were then spent in England, it being estimated that in 1842
Â£6,000,000 was remitted out of Ireland. According to Woodham-Smith, the
ability of the middlemen was measured by the amount of money they could
contrive to extract. Described by the Commission as "the most oppressive
species of tyrant that ever lent assistance to the destruction of a country,"
they were invariably described as "land sharks" and "bloodsuckers." The
middlemen leased large tracts of land from the landlords on long leases with
fixed rents, which they then sublet as they saw fit. They split the holding
into smaller and smaller parcels to increase the amounts of rents they could
then obtain, a system called "conacre". Tenants could be evicted for reasons
such as non-payment of rents (which were very high), or if the landlord decided
to raise sheep instead of grain crops. The cottier paid his rent by working for
the landlord. Any improvements made on the holdings by the tenants became the
property of the landlords when the lease expired or was terminated, which acted
as a disincentive to improvements. The tenants had no security of tenure on the
land; being tenants "at will" they could be turned out whenever the landlord
chose. This class of tenant made up the majority of tenant farmers in Ireland,
the exception being in Ulster where there existed a practice known as "tenant
right", under which tenants were compensated for any improvements made to their
holdings. The commission according to Woodham-Smith stated that "the superior
prosperity and tranquility of Ulster, compared with the rest of Ireland, were
due to tenant right." Landlords in Ireland used their powers without remorse,
and the people lived in dread of them. In these circumstances, Woodham-Smith
writes "industry and enterprise were extinguished and a peasantry created which
was one of the most destitute in Europe." Tenants, subdivisions, and
bankruptcy. In 1845, 24% of all Irish tenant farms were of 0.4â€“2Â hectares
(1â€“5Â acres) in size, while 40% were of 2â€“6Â hectares (5â€“15Â acres).
Holdings were so small that no other crop than potatoes would suffice to feed a
family, nor could ranching be a possibility due to the limited land. The
British government reported, shortly before the famine, that poverty was so
widespread that one-third of all Irish small holdings could not support their
families, after paying their rent, except by earnings of seasonal migrant
labour in England and Scotland. Following the famine, reforms were implemented
making it illegal to further divide land holdings. The 1841 census showed a
population of just over eight million. Two-thirds of those depended on
agriculture for their survival, but they rarely received a working wage. They
had to work for their landlords in return for the patch of land they needed in
order to grow enough food for their own families. This was the system which
forced Ireland and its peasantry into monoculture, as only the potato could be
grown in sufficient quantity. The rights to a plot of land in Ireland could
mean the difference between life and death in the early 19th century. Potato
dependency. The potato was introduced to Ireland as a garden crop of the
gentry. By the late 17th century, it had become widespread as a supplementary
rather than a principal food, as the main diet still revolved around butter,
milk, and grain products. In the first two decades of the 18th century,
however, it became a base food of the poor, especially in winter. The expansion
of the economy between 1760 and 1815 saw the potato make inroads in the diet of
the people and became a staple food all the year round for farmers. The large
dependency on this single crop was one of the reasons why the emergence of
Phytophthora infestans had such devastating effects in Ireland, and had far
less effects in other European countries (which were also hit by the disease).
The potato's spread was essential to the development of the cottier system,
delivering an extremely cheap workforce, but at the cost of lower living
standards. For the labourer, it was essentially a potato wage that shaped the
expanding agrarian economy. The expansion of tillage led to an inevitable
expansion of the potato acreage and an expansion of peasant farmers. By 1841,
there were over half a million peasant farmers, with 1.75 million dependants.
The principal beneficiary of this system was the English consumer. The potato
was also used extensively as a fodder crop for livestock immediately prior to
the famine. Approximately 33% of production, amounting to , was normally used
in this way. The 1848 figures are based on extrapolation from incomplete
returns. Blight in Ireland. Prior to the arrival in Ireland of the disease
"Phytophthora infestans", commonly known as blight, there were only two main
potato plant diseases. One was called 'dry rot' or 'taint' and the other was a
virus, known popularly as 'curl'. "Phytophthora infestans" is an oomycete (not
a fungus). In 1851, the Census of Ireland Commissioners recorded 24 failures of
the potato crop going back to 1728, of varying severity. In 1739, the crop was
"entirely destroyed", and again in 1740. In 1770, the crop largely failed
again. In 1800, there was another "general" failure, and in 1807, 50% of the
crop was lost. In 1821 and 1822, the potato crop failed completely in Munster
and Connaught, and 1830 and 1831 were years of failure in Mayo, Donegal and
Galway. In 1832, 1833, 1834 and 1836, a large number of districts suffered
serious loss, and in 1835, the potato failed in Ulster. 1836 and 1837 brought
"extensive" failures throughout Ireland and again in 1839 failure was universal
throughout the country; both 1841 and 1844 potato crop failure was widespread.
According to Woodham-Smith, "the unreliability of the potato crop was an
accepted fact in Ireland. How and when the blight "Phytophthora infestans"
arrived in Europe is still uncertain; according to P.M.A Bourke, however, it
almost certainly was not present prior to 1842, and probably arrived in 1844.
The origin of the fungus has been traced to Toluca Valley of Mexico, from
whence it spread first within North America and then to Europe In 1844, Irish
newspapers carried reports concerning a disease which for two years had
attacked the potato crops in America. According to James Donnelly, a likely
source was the eastern United States, where in 1843 and 1844 blight largely
destroyed the potato crops. He suggests that ships from Baltimore, Philadelphia
or New York could have brought diseased potatoes to European ports. W.C.
Paddock suggests that it was transported on potatoes being carried to feed
passengers on clipper ships sailing from America to Ireland. Once it was
introduced, it spread rapidly. By late summer and early autumn of 1845, it had
spread throughout the greater part of northern and central Europe. Belgium,
Holland, northern France and southern England by mid-August had all been
stricken. On August 16, the "Gardeners' Chronicle and Horticultural Gazette"
printed a report which described 'a blight of unusual character' in the Isle of
Wight. A week later, on 23 August, it reported that 'A fearful malady has
broken out among the potato crop... In Belgium the fields are said to be
completely desolated. There is hardly a sound sample in Covent Garden market...
As for cure for this distemper, there is none...' These reports were
extensively covered in Irish newspapers. On 13 September the "Gardeners'
Chronicle" made 'a dramatic announcement': 'We stop the Press with very great
regret to announce that the potato Murrain has unequivocally declared itself in
Ireland.' The British Government were nevertheless optimistic through the next
few weeks. Crop loss in 1845 has been estimated at anywhere from one third to
as high as one half of cultivated acreage. The Mansion House Committee in
Dublin, to which hundreds of letters were directed from all over Ireland,
claimed on November 19, 1845 to have ascertained beyond the shadow of doubt
that 'considerably more than one-third of the entire of the potato crop ... has
been already destroyed'. In 1846, three quarters of the harvest was lost to
blight. By December, a third of a million destitute people were employed in
public works. According to Cormac Ã“ GrÃ¡da the first attack of potato blight
caused considerable hardship in rural Ireland, from the autumn of 1846, when
the first deaths from starvation were recorded. Seed potatoes were scarce in
1847, little had been sown, so despite average yields, hunger continued. 1848
yields would be only two thirds of normal. As over 3 million Irish people were
totally dependent on potatoes for food, hunger and famine were inevitable.
Reaction in Ireland. The Corporation of Dublin sent a memorial to the Queen,
"praying her" to call Parliament together early (Parliament was at this time
prorogued), and to recommend the requisition of some public money for public
works, especially railways in Ireland. The Town Council of Belfast met and made
similar suggestions, but neither body asked for charity, according to Mitchel.
"They demanded that, if Ireland was indeed an Integral part of the realm, the
common exchequer of both islands should be usedâ€”not to give alms, but to
provide employment on public works of general utility." It was Mitchel's
opinion that "if Yorkshire and Lancashire had sustained a like calamity in
England, there is no doubt such measures as these would have been taken,
promptly and liberally." A deputation from the citizens of Dublin, including
the Duke of Leinster, the Lord Mayor, Lord Cloncurry, and Daniel O'Connell,
went to the current Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and offered suggestions, such
as opening the ports to foreign corn for a time, stopping distillation from
grain, or providing public works; that this was extremely urgent, as millions
of people would shortly be without food. Lord Heytesbury told them they "were
premature", and told them not to be alarmed, that learned men (Playfair and
Lindley) had been sent from England to enquire into all those matters; and that
the Inspectors of Constabulary and Stipendiary Magistrates were charged with
making constant reports from their districts; and there was no "immediate
pressure on the market". Of these reports from Lord Heytesbury, Peel in a
letter to Sir James Graham was to say that he found the accounts "very
alarming", though he reminded him that there was, according to Woodham-Smith
"always a tendency to exaggeration in Irish news". On December 8, 1845, Daniel
O'Connell, in the Repeal Association, proposed the following remedies to the
pending disaster. One of the first things he suggested was the introduction of
"Tenant-Right" as practised in Ulster, giving the landlord a fair rent for his
land, but giving the tenant compensation for any money he might have laid out
on the land in permanent improvements. O'Connell then pointed out the means
used by the Belgian legislature during the same season: shutting their ports
against the export of provisions, but opening them to imports. He suggested
that if Ireland had a domestic Parliament the ports would be thrown open and
the abundant crops raised in Ireland would be kept for the people of Ireland.
O'Connell maintained that only an Irish parliament would provide for the people
both food and employment, saying that a repeal of the Act of Union was a
necessity and Ireland's only hope. John Mitchel, one of the leading political
writers of Young Ireland, as early as 1844, in "The Nation" raised the issue of
the ""Potato Disease"" in Ireland noting how powerful an agent hunger had been
in certain revolutions. On February 14, 1846, he put forward his views on "the
wretched way in which the famine was being trifled with", and asked, had not
the Government even yet any conception that there might be soon "millions of
human beings in Ireland having nothing to eat." On February 28, writing on the
Coercion Bill which was then going through the House of Lords, he noted that
this was the only kind of legislation that was sure to meet with no obstruction
in the British House of Commons. His view was that however the government may
differ about feeding the Irish people, "they agree most cordially in the policy
of taxing, prosecuting and ruining them." (As it happened, the bill was
subsequently defeated, and Peel's government fell.) In an article on ""English
Rule"" on March 7, Mitchel wrote that the Irish People were "expecting famine
day by day" and they attributed it collectively, not to "the rule of heaven as
to the greedy and cruel policy of England." He continued in the same article to
write that the people "believe that the season as they roll are but ministers
of England's rapacity; that their starving children cannot sit down to their
scanty meal but they see the harpy claw of England in their dish." The people,
Mitchel wrote, watched as their "food melting in rottenness off the face of the
earth," all the while watching "heavy-laden ships, freighted with the yellow
corn their own hands have sown and reaped, spreading all sail for England."
Mitchel later wrote one of the first widely circulated tracts on the famine,
"The Last Conquest of Ireland (Perhaps)" in 1861. It established the widespread
view that the treatment of the famine by the British was a deliberate murder of
the Irish, and contained the famous phrase: Mitchel was charged with sedition
because of his writings, but this charge was dropped and he was convicted by a
packed jury under the newly enacted Treason Felony Act and sentenced to 14
years transportation to Bermuda. "The Nation" according to Charles Gavan Duffy,
insisted that the one remedy was that which the rest of Europe had adopted,
which even the parliaments of the Pale had adopted in periods of distress,
which was to retain in the country the food raised by her people till the
people were fed. Ireland at this time was, according to the Act of Union of
1801, an integral part of the British imperial homeland, "the richest empire on
the globe," and was "the most fertile portion of that empire," in addition;
Ireland was sheltered by both "... Habeas Corpus and trial by jury ...". And
yet Ireland's elected representatives seemed powerless to act on the country's
behalf as Members of the British Parliament. Commenting on this at the time
John Mitchel wrote: "That an island which is said to be an integral part of the
richest empire on the globe ... should in five years lose two and a half
millions of its people (more than one fourth) by hunger, and fever the
consequence of hunger, and flight beyond sea to escape from hunger ..." The
period of the potato blight in Ireland from 1845 to 1851 was full of political
confrontation. A more radical Young Ireland group seceded from the Repeal
movement and attempted an armed rebellion in the Young Irelander Rebellion of
1848. It was unsuccessful. Government response. F.S.L. Lyons characterised the
initial response of the British government to the early less severe phase of
the famine as "prompt and relatively successful." Confronted by widespread crop
failure in the autumn of 1845, Prime Minister Sir Robert Peel purchased
Â£100,000 worth of maize and cornmeal secretly from America. Baring Brothers &
Co initially acted as purchasing agents for the Prime Minister. The government
hoped that they would not "stifle private enterprise" and that their actions
would not act as a disincentive to local relief efforts. Due to weather
conditions, the first shipment did not arrive in Ireland until the beginning of
February 1846. The maize corn was then re-sold for a penny a pound. The corn
when it arrived had not been ground and was inedible , and this task involved a
long and complicated process if it was to be done correctly and it was unlikely
to be carried out locally. In addition, before the cornmeal could be consumed,
it had to be 'very much' cooked again, or eating it could result in severe
bowel complaints. Because of maize's (commonly) yellow colour, and the fact
that it had to be ground twice, it became known in Ireland as 'Peel's
brimstone'. In 1846, Peel then moved to repeal the Corn Laws, tariffs on grain
which kept the price of bread artificially high. The famine situation worsened
during 1846 and the repeal of the Corn Laws in that year did little to help the
starving Irish; the measure split the Conservative Party, leading to the fall
of Peel's ministry. In March, Peel set up a programme of public works in
Ireland but was forced to resign as Prime Minister on 29 June." This fall came
on June 25, when he was defeated in the House of Commons on a motion that the
Irish Coercion Bill be read a second time. According to Michael Doheny, the
majority against him was 73, and it was made of the "Whig party, the extreme
Conservatives, the ultra-Radicals and Irish Repealers." Ten days after, Lord
John Russell assumed the seals of office. The measures undertaken by Peel's
successor, Lord John Russell, proved comparatively "inadequate" as the crisis
deepened. Russell's ministry introduced public works projects, which by
December 1846 employed some half million Irish and proved impossible to
administer. Sir Charles Trevelyan, who was in charge of the administration of
Government relief to the victims of the Irish Famine, limited the Government's
actual relief because he thought "the judgement of God sent the calamity to
teach the Irish a lesson". For his policy, he was commemorated in the song The
Fields of Athenry. The Public Works were "strictly ordered" to be
unproductiveâ€”that is, they would create no fund to repay their own expenses.
Many hundreds of thousands of "feeble and starving men" according to John
Mitchel, were kept digging holes, and breaking up roads, which was doing no
service. The new Lord John Russell Whig administration, influenced by their
laissez-faire belief that the market would provide the food needed but at the
same time ignoring the food exports to England, then halted government food and
relief works, leaving many hundreds of thousands of people without any work,
money or food. In January, the government abandoned these projects and turned
to a mixture of "indoor" and "outdoor" direct relief; the former administered
in workhouses through the Poor Law, the latter through soup kitchens. The costs
of the Poor Law fell primarily on the local landlords, who in turn attempted to
reduce their liability by evicting their tenants. This was then facilitated
through the "Cheap Ejectment Acts." The poor law amendment act was passed in
June 1847. According to James Donnelly in "Fearful Realities: New Perspectives
on the Famine", it embodied the principle popular in Britain that Irish
property must support Irish poverty. The landed proprietors in Ireland were
held in Britain to have created the conditions that led to the famine. It was
asserted however, that the British parliament since the Act of Union of 1800
was partly to blame. This point was raised in the Illustrated London News on 13
February 13, 1847, "There was no laws it would not pass at their request, and
no abuse it would not defend for them." On 24 March "The Times" reported that
Britain had permitted in Ireland "a mass of poverty, disaffection, and
degradation without a parallel in the world. It allowed proprietors to suck the
very life-blood of that wretched race." The "Gregory clause" of the Poor Law
prohibited anyone who held at least Â¼ of an acre from receiving relief. This
in practice meant that if a farmer, having sold all his produce to pay rent,
duties, rates and taxes, should be reduced, as many thousands of them were, to
applying for public outdoor relief, he would not get it until he had first
delivered up all his land to the landlord. Of this Law Mitchel was to write:
"it is the able-bodied idler only who is to be fed â€” if he attempted to till
but one rood of ground, he dies." This simple method of ejectment was called
"passing paupers through the workhouse" â€” a man went in, a pauper came out.
These factors combined to drive thousands of people off the land: 90,000 in
1849, and 104,000 in 1850. Food exports to England. Records show Irish lands
exported food even during the worst years of the Famine. When Ireland had
experienced a famine in 1782â€“1783, ports were closed to keep Irish-grown food
in Ireland to feed the Irish. Local food prices promptly dropped. Merchants
lobbied against the export ban, but government in the 1780s overrode their
protests. No such export ban happened in the 1840s. Cecil Woodham-Smith, an
authority on the Irish Famine, wrote in "" that no issue has provoked so much
anger and embittered relations between England and Ireland as "the indisputable
fact that huge quantities of food were exported from Ireland to England
throughout the period when the people of Ireland were dying of starvation."
Ireland remained a net exporter of food throughout most of the five-year
famine. Christine Kinealy writes that Irish exports of calves, livestock
(except pigs), bacon and ham actually increased during the famine. The food was
shipped under guard from the most famine-stricken parts of Ireland. However,
the poor had no money to buy food and the government then did not ban exports.
Charity. William Smith O'Brien, speaking on the subject of charity in a speech
to the Repeal Association, February 1845, applauded the fact that the universal
sentiment on the subject of charity was that they would accept no English
charity. He expressed the view that the resources of this country were still
abundantly adequate to maintain the population and that until those resources
had been utterly exhausted, he hoped that there was no one in "Ireland who will
so degrade himself as to ask the aid of a subscription from England". Mitchel
wrote in his "The Last Conquest of Ireland (Perhaps)", on the same subject,
that no one from Ireland ever asked for charity during this period, and that it
was England who sought charity on Ireland's behalf, and, having received it,
was also responsible for administering it. He suggested that it has been
carefully inculcated by the British Press, "that the moment Ireland fell into
distress, she became an abject beggar at England's gate, and that she even
craved alms from all mankind." He affirmed that in Ireland no one ever asked
alms or favours of any kind from England or any other nation, but that it was
England herself that begged for Ireland. He suggested that it was England that
"sent 'round the hat over all the globe, asking a penny for the love of God to
relieve the poor Irish," and constituting herself the agent of all that
charity, took all the profit of it. Large sums of money were donated by
charities; Calcutta is credited with making the first donation of Â£14,000. The
money was raised by Irish soldiers serving there and Irish people employed by
the East India Company. Pope Pius IX sent funds and Queen Victoria donated
Â£2,000. In addition to the religious, non-religious organisations came to the
assistance of famine victims. The British Relief Association was one such
group. Founded in 1847, the Association raised money throughout England,
America and Australia; their funding drive benefited by a "Queen's Letter", a
letter from Queen Victoria appealing for money to relieve the distress in
Ireland. With this initial letter the Association raised Â£171,533. A second,
somewhat less successful "Queen's Letter" was issued in late 1847. In total,
the British Relief Association raised approximately Â£200,000 (c. US$1,000,000
at the time). Private initiatives such as The Central Relief Committee of the
Society of Friends (Quakers) attempted to fill the gap caused by the end of
government relief and eventually the government reinstated the relief works,
although bureaucracy slowed the release of food supplies. Ottoman aid.
According to legend, in 1845, Ottoman Sultan AbdÃ¼lmecid declared his intention
to send Â£10,000 to Irish farmers but Queen Victoria requested that the Sultan
send only Â£1,000, because she herself had sent only Â£2,000. The Sultan sent
the Â£1,000 sterling but also sent three ships full of food. According to
Abdullah Aymaz in an article in "The Fountain" magazine, the British
administration tried to block the ships, but the food arrived secretly at
Drogheda harbour and was left there by Ottoman sailors. Uncertainty remains
regarding the story as shipping records relating to the port at this time
appear not to have survived. From Native Americans. In 1847, midway through the
Great Irish Famine (1845â€“1849), a group of Native American Choctaws collected
$710 (although many articles say the original amount was $170 after a misprint
in Angie Debo's "The Rise and Fall of the Choctaw Republic") and sent it to
help starving Irish men, women and children. "It had been just 16 years since
the Choctaw people had experienced the Trail of Tears, and they had faced
starvation... It was an amazing gesture." according to Judy Allen, editor of
the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma's newspaper, "Bishinik", based at the Oklahoma
Choctaw tribal headquarters in Durant, Oklahoma. To mark the 150th anniversary,
eight Irish people retraced the Trail of Tears, and the donation was publicly
commemorated by President Mary Robinson. Eviction. Landlords were responsible
for paying the rates of every tenant who paid less than Â£4 in yearly rent.
Landlords whose land was crowded with poorer tenants were now faced with large
bills. They began clearing the poor tenants from their small plots, and letting
the land in larger plots for over Â£4 which then reduced their debts. In 1846,
there had been some clearances, but the great mass of evictions came in 1847.
According to James S. Donnelly Jr, it is impossible to be sure how many people
were evicted during the years of the famine and its immediate aftermath. It was
only in 1849 that the police began to keep a count, and they recorded a total
of almost 250,000 persons as officially evicted between 1849 and 1854. Donnelly
considered this to be an underestimate, and if the figures were to include the
number pressured into "voluntary" surrenders during the whole period
(1846â€“1854) the figure would almost certainly exceed half a million persons.
While Helen Litton says there were also thousands of "voluntary" surrenders,
she notes also that there was "precious little voluntary about them." In some
cases, tenants were persuaded to accept a small sum of money to leave their
homes, "cheated into believing the workhouse would take them in." West Clare
was one of the worst areas for evictions, where landlords turned thousands of
families out and demolished their derisory cabins. Captain Kennedy in April
1848 estimated that 1,000 houses, with an average of six people to each, had
been levelled since November. The Mahon family, Strokestown House alone in 1847
evicted 3,000 people, and according to John Gibney were still able to dine on
lobster soup. After Clare, the worst area for evictions was County Mayo,
accounting for 10% of all evictions between 1849 and 1854. The Earl of Lucan,
who owned over was among the worst evicting landlords. He was quoted as saying
'he would not breed paupers to pay priests'. Having turned out in the parish of
Ballinrobe over 2,000 tenants alone, the cleared land he then used as grazing
farms. In 1848, the Marquis of Sligo owed Â£1,650 to Westport Union; he was
also an evicting landlord, though he claimed to be selective, saying he was
only getting rid of the idle and dishonest. Altogether, he cleared about 25% of
his tenants. According to Litton, evictions might have taken place earlier but
for fear of the secret societies. However they were now greatly weakened by the
Famine. Revenge still occasionally took place, with seven landlords being shot,
six fatally, during the autumn and winter of 1847. Ten other occupiers of land,
though without tenants, were also murdered, she says. Lord Clarendon, alarmed
that this might mean rebellion, asked for special powers. Lord John Russell was
not sympathetic to this appeal. Lord Clarendon believed that the landlords
themselves were mostly responsible for the tragedy in the first place, saying
"It is quite true that landlords in England would not like to be shot like
hares and partridges...but neither does any landlord in England turn out fifty
persons at once and burn their houses over their heads, giving them no
provision for the future." The Crime and Outrage Act was passed in December
1847 as a compromise and additional troops were sent to Ireland. Under the
notorious Gregory clause, described by Donnelly as a "vicious amendment to the
Irish poor law, named after William H. Gregory, M.P. and commonly known as the
quarter-acre clause, provided that no tenant holding more than a quarter-acre
of land would be eligible for public assistance either in or outside the
workhouse. This clause had been a successful Tory amendment to the Whig poor-
relief bill which became law in early June 1847, where its potential as an
estate-clearing device was widely recognised in parliament, though not in
advance. At first the poor law commissioners and inspectors viewed the clause
as a valuable instrument for a more cost-effective administration of public
relief, but the drawbacks soon became apparent, even from an administrative
perspective. They would soon view them as little more than murderous from a
humanitarian perspective. According to Donnelly it became obvious that the
quarter-acre clause was "indirectly a death-dealing instrument." Emigration.
While the famine was responsible for a significant increase in emigration from
Ireland, of anywhere from 45% to nearly 85% depending on the year and the
county, it was not the sole cause. Nor was it even the era when mass emigration
from Ireland commenced. That can be traced to the middle of the 18th century,
when some 250,000 people left Ireland to settle in the New World alone, over a
period of some 50 years. From the defeat of Napoleon to the beginning of the
famine, a period of 30 years, "at least 1,000,000 and possibly 1,500,000
emigrated". However, during the worst of the famine, emigration reached
somewhere around 250,000 in one year alone, with far more emigrants leaving
from western Ireland than any other part. Families did not migrate "en masse"
but younger members of families did. So much so that emigration almost became a
rite of passage, as evidenced by the data that show that, unlike similar
emigration throughout world history, women emigrated just as often, just as
early, and in the same numbers as men. The emigrant started a new life in a new
land, sent remittances " Â£1,404,000 by 1851" back to his/her family in Ireland
which, in turn, allowed another member of the family to emigrate. Emigration
during the famine years of 1845â€“1850 was to England, Scotland, the U.S.,
Canada, and Australia. Many of those fleeing to the Americas used the well-
established McCorkell Line. Of the 100,000 Irish that sailed to Canada in 1847,
an estimated one out of five died from disease and malnutrition, including over
5,000 at Grosse Isle. Mortality rates of 30% aboard the coffin ships were
common. By 1854, between 1.5 and 2Â million Irish left their country due to
evictions, starvation, and harsh living conditions. In America, most Irish
became city-dwellers: with little money, many had to settle in the cities that
the ships they came on landed in. By 1850, the Irish made up a quarter of the
population in Boston, Massachusetts; New York City; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania;
and Baltimore, Maryland. In addition, Irish populations became prevalent in
some American mining communities. The 1851 census reported that more than half
the inhabitants of Toronto, Ontario were Irish, and in 1847 alone, 38,000
famine Irish flooded a city with fewer than 20,000 citizens. Other Canadian
cities such as Saint John, New Brunswick; Quebec City and Montreal, Quebec;
Ottawa, Kingston and Hamilton, Ontario also received large numbers of Famine
Irish since Canada, as part of the British Empire, could not close its ports to
Irish ships (unlike the U.S.), and they could get passage cheaply (or free in
the case of tenant evictions) in returning empty lumber holds. However fearing
nationalist insurgencies the British government placed harsh restrictions on
Irish immigration to Canada after 1847 resulting in larger influxes to the U.S.
The largest Famine grave site outside of Ireland is at Grosse-ÃŽle, Quebec, an
island in the St. Lawrence River used to quarantine ships near Quebec City. In
1851, about a quarter of Liverpool's population was Irish-born. The famine
marked the beginning of the steep depopulation of Ireland in the 19th century.
Population had increased by 13â€“14% in the first three decades of the 19th
century. Between 1831 and 1841, population grew by 5%. Application of Thomas
Malthus's idea of population expanding geometrically while resources increase
arithmetically was popular during the famines of 1817 and 1822. However by the
1830s, a decade before the famine, they were seen as overly simplistic and
Ireland's problems were seen "less as an excess of population than as a lack of
capital investment." The population of Ireland was increasing no faster than
that of England, which suffered no equivalent catastrophe. 1848 rebellion. In
1847, William Smith O'Brien, the leader of the Young Ireland party, became one
of the founding members of the Irish Confederation to campaign for a Repeal of
the Act of Union, and called for the export of grain to be stopped and the
ports closed. The following year he organised the resistance of landless
farmers in County Tipperary against the landowners and their agents. Death
toll. It is not known exactly how many people died during the period of the
Famine, although it is believed more died from diseases than from starvation.
State registration of births, marriages or deaths had not yet begun, and
records kept by the Roman Catholic Church are incomplete. Eyewitness accounts
have helped medical historians identify both the ailments and effects of
famine, and have been used to evaluate and explain in greater detail features
of the famine. In Mayo, English Quaker William Bennett wrote of Revd Dr. Traill
Hall, a Church of Ireland rector in Schull, described Marasmic children also
left a permanent image on Quaker Joseph Crosfield who in 1846 witnessed a
William Forster wrote in Carrick-on-Shannon that One possible estimate has been
reached by comparing the expected population with the eventual numbers in the
1850s -see Irish population analysis. Earlier predictions expected that by 1851
Ireland would have a population of 8â€“9 million. A census taken in 1841
revealed a population of slightly over 8 million. A census immediately after
the famine in 1851 counted 6,552,385, a drop of almost 1.5 million in 10 years.
Modern historian R.J. Foster estimates that 'at least 775,000 died, mostly
through disease, including cholera in the latter stages of the holocaust'. He
further notes that 'a recent sophisticated computation estimates excess deaths
from 1846 to 1851 as between 1,000,000 and 1,500,000...; after a careful
critique of this, other statisticians arrive at a figure of 1,000,000.' In
addition, in excess of 1 million Irish emigrated to Great Britain, U.S.,
Canada, Australia, and elsewhere, while millions emigrated over following
decades. Detailed statistics of the population of Ireland since 1841 are
available at Irish population analysis. Perhaps the best-known estimates of
deaths at a county level are those by Joel Mokyr. The range of Mokyr's
mortality figures goes from 1.1 million to 1.5 million Famine deaths in Ireland
between 1846 and 1851. Mokyr produced two sets of data which contained an
upper-bound and lower-bound estimate, which showed not much difference in
regional patterns. Because of such anomalies, Cormac Ã“ GrÃ¡da revisited the
work of S. H. Cousens. Cousens' estimates of mortality relied heavily on
retrospective information contained in the 1851 census. The death tables,
contained in the 1851 census have been rightly criticised, as underestimating
the true extent of mortality, Cousens' mortality of 800,000 is now regarded as
much too low. There were a number of reasons for this, because the information
was gathered from the surviving householders and others and having to look back
over the previous 10 years, it underestimates the true extent of disease and
mortality. Death and emigration had also cleared away entire families, leaving
few or no survivors to answer the questions on the census. Another area of
uncertainty lies in the descriptions of disease given by tenants as to the
cause of their relatives' deaths. Though Wilde's work has been rightly
criticised as underestimating the true extent of mortality, it does provide a
framework for the medical history of the Great Famine. The diseases that badly
affected the population fell into two categories, famine-induced diseases and
diseases of nutritional deficiency. Of the nutritional deficiency diseases the
most commonly experienced were starvation and marasmus, as well as condition
called at the time dropsy. Dropsy (Edema) was a popular name given for the
symptoms of several diseases, one of which, kwashiorkor, is associated with
starvation. The greatest mortality, however, was not from nutritional
deficiency diseases, but from famine-induced ailments. The malnourished are
very vulnerable to infections; therefore, they were more severe when they
occurred. Measles, diarrhoeal diseases, tuberculosis, most respiratory
infections, whooping cough, many intestinal parasites and cholera were all
strongly conditioned by nutritional status. Potentially lethal diseases, such
as smallpox and influenza, were so virulent that their spread was independent
of nutrition. A significant cause spreading disease during the Famine was
"social dislocation." The best example of this phenomenon was fever, which
exacted the greatest toll of death. In the popular mind, as well as among much
medical opinion, fever and famine are closely related. This view was not wholly
mistaken, but the most critical connection was the congregating of the hungry
at soup kitchens, food depots, overcrowded work houses where conditions were
ideal for spreading infectious diseases such as typhus, typhoid and relapsing
fever. As to the diarrhoeal diseases, their presence was the result of poor
hygiene, bad sanitation and dietary changes. The concluding attack on a
population incapacitated by famine was delivered by Asiatic cholera. Cholera
had visited Ireland, briefly in the 1830s. But in the following decade it
spread uncontrollably across Asia, through Europe, and into Britain and finally
reached Ireland in 1849. On the 1851 census, both Cormac Ã“ GrÃ¡da & Joel Mokyr
would also describe it as a famous but flawed source. They would contend that
the combination of institutional and individuals figures gives "an incomplete
and biased count" of fatalities during the famine. Ã“ GrÃ¡da referencing the
work of W. A. MacArthur, writes, specialists have long known the Irish death
tables left a lot to be desired in terms of accuracy. As a result, Ã“ GrÃ¡da
says to take the Tables of Death at face value would be a grave mistake, as
they seriously undercount the number of deaths both before and during the
famine. In 1851, the census commissioners collected information on the number
who died in each family since 1841, the cause, season and year of death. Its
disputed findings were as follows: 21,770 total deaths from starvation in the
previous decade, and 400,720 deaths from disease. Listed diseases were fever,
dysentery, cholera, smallpox and influenza; the first two being the main
killers (222,021 and 93,232). The commissioners acknowledged that their figures
were incomplete and that the true number of deaths was probably higher: "The
greater the amount of destitution of mortality...the less will be the amount of
recorded deaths derived through any household form; â€“ for not only were whole
families swept away by disease...but whole villages were effaced from off the
land." A later historian has this to say: "In 1851, the Census Commissioners
attempted to produce a table of mortality for each year since 1841... The
statistics provided were flawed and probably under-estimated the level of
mortality..." Other, perhaps less reliable and likely underestimates are that
the event led to the deaths of approximately 1 million people through
starvation and disease; a further million are thought to have emigrated as a
result of the famine. Some scholars estimate that the population of Ireland was
reduced by 20â€“25%. All of this occurred while taxes, rents, and food exports
were being collected and sent to British landlords, in an amount surpassing Â£6
million. Aftermath. The potato remained Ireland's staple crop after the famine;
at the end of the 19th century, the Irish per capita consumption of four pounds
a day was the highest in the world. Later famines made only minimal effect and
are generally forgotten, except by historians. By the 1911 census, the island
of Ireland's population had fallen to 4.4Â million, about the same as the
population in 1800 and 2000 and only a half of its peak population. Judgement
of the government's role. Contemporary. Contemporary opinion was sharply
critical of the Russell government's response to and management of the crisis.
From the start, there were accusations that the government failed to grasp the
magnitude of the disaster. Sir James Graham, who had served as Home Secretary
in Sir Robert Peel's late government, wrote to Peel that, in his opinion, "the
real extent and magnitude of the Irish difficulty are underestimated by the
Government, and cannot be met by measures within the strict rule of economical
science." This criticism was not confined to outside critics. The Lord
Lieutenant of Ireland, Lord Clarendon, wrote a letter to Russell on April 26,
1849, urging that the government propose additional relief measures: "I do not
think there is another legislature in Europe that would disregard such
suffering as now exists in the west of Ireland, or coldly persist in a policy
of extermination." Also in 1849 the Chief Poor Law Commissioner, Edward
Twisleton, resigned in protest over the Rate-in-Aid Act, which provided
additional funds for the Poor Law through a 6p in the pound levy on all
rateable properties in Ireland. Twisleton testified that "comparatively
trifling sums were required for Britain to spare itself the deep disgrace of
permitting its miserable fellow subjects to die of starvation." According to
Peter Gray, in his book "The Irish Famine", the government spent Â£7,000,000
for relief in Ireland between 1845 and 1850, "representing less than half of
one percent of the British gross national product over five years.
Contemporaries noted the sharp contrast with the 20 million pounds compensation
given to West Indian slave-owners in the 1830s." Other critics maintained that
even after the government recognised the scope of the crisis, it failed to take
sufficient steps to address it. John Mitchel, one of the leaders of the Young
Ireland Movement, wrote the following in 1860: "I have called it an artificial
famine: that is to say, it was a famine which desolated a rich and fertile
island that produced every year abundance and superabundance to sustain all her
people and many more. The English, indeed, call the famine a 'dispensation of
Providence;' and ascribe it entirely to the blight on potatoes. But potatoes
failed in like manner all over Europe; yet there was no famine save in Ireland.
The British account of the matter, then, is first, a fraud; second, a
blasphemy. The Almighty, indeed, sent the potato blight, but the English
created the famine." Still other critics saw reflected in the government's
response the government's attitude to the so-called "Irish Question". Nassau
Senior, an economics professor at Oxford University, wrote that the Famine
"would not kill more than one million people, and that would scarcely be enough
to do any good." In 1848, Denis Shine Lawlor suggested that Russell was a
student of the Elizabethan poet Edmund Spenser, who had calculated "how far
English colonisation and English policy might be most effectively carried out
by Irish starvation." Charles Trevelyan, the civil servant with most direct
responsibility for the government's handling of the famine, described it in
1848 as "a direct stroke of an all-wise and all-merciful Providence", which
laid bare "the deep and inveterate root of social evil"; the Famine, he
affirmed, was "the sharp but effectual remedy by which the cure is likely to be
effected. God grant that the generation to which this opportunity has been
offered may rightly perform its part..." Historical. Christine Kinealy
expresses the consensus of historians when she states that "the major tragedy
of the Irish Famine of 1845â€“52 marked a watershed in modern Irish history.
Its occurrence, however, was neither inevitable nor unavoidable." The
underlying factors which combined to cause the famine were aggravated by an
inadequate government response. As Kinealy notes, "...he government had to do
something to help alleviate the suffering, the particular nature of the actual
response, especially following 1846, suggests a more covert agenda and
motivation. As the Famine progressed, it became apparent that the government
was using its information not merely to help it formulate its relief policies,
but also as an opportunity to facilitate various long-desired changes within
Ireland. These included population control and the consolidation of property
through various means, including emigration... Despite the overwhelming
evidence of prolonged distress caused by successive years of potato blight, the
underlying philosophy of the relief efforts was that they should be kept to a
minimalist level; in fact they actually decreased as the Famine progressed."
Some also pointed to the structure of the British Empire as a contributing
factor. James Anthony Froude wrote that "England governed Ireland for what she
deemed her own interest, making her calculations on the gross balance of her
trade ledgers, and leaving moral obligations aside, as if right and wrong had
been blotted out of the statute book of the Universe." Dennis Clark, an Irish-
American historian and critic of empire, claimed that the famine was "the
culmination of generations of neglect, misrule and repression. It was an epic
of English colonial cruelty and inadequacy. For the landless cabin dwellers it
meant emigration or extinction..." Suggestions of genocide. The famine is still
a controversial event in Irish history. Debate and discussion on the British
government's response to the failure of the potato crop in Ireland, the
exportation of food crops and livestock, the subsequent large-scale starvation,
and whether or not this constituted genocide, remains a historically and
politically charged issue. In 1996, Francis A. Boyle, a law professor at the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, wrote a report commissioned by the
New York-based Irish Famine/Genocide Committee, which concluded that the
British government deliberately pursued a race and ethnicity-based policy aimed
at destroying the group commonly known as the Irish people and that the policy
of mass starvation amounted to genocide per the Hague convention of 1948. On
the strength of Boyle's report, the U.S. state of New Jersey included the
famine in the "Holocaust and Genocide Curriculum" at the secondary tier.
Historian Peter Duffy writes that "The government's crime, which deserves to
blacken its name forever ..." was rooted "in the effort to regenerate Ireland"
through "landlord-engineered replacement of tillage plots with grazing lands"
that "took precedence over the obligation to provide food ... for its starving
citizens. It is little wonder that the policy looked to many people like
genocide." Several commentators have argued that the searing effect of the
famine has on Irish cultural memory creates effects similar to that of
genocide, while maintaining that one did not occur. Robert Kee suggests that
the Famine is seen as "comparable" in its force on "popular national
consciousness to that of the 'final solution' on the Jews," and that it is not
"infrequently" thought that the Famine was something very like "a form of
genocide engineered by the English against the Irish people." This point was
echoed by James Donnelly, a historian at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison,
who wrote in his work "Landlord and Tenant in Nineteenth-century Ireland", "I
would draw the following broad conclusion: at a fairly early stage of the Great
Famine the government's abject failure to stop or even slow down the clearances
(evictions) contributed in a major way to enshrining the idea of English state-
sponsored genocide in Irish popular mind. Or perhaps one should say in the
Irish mind, for this was a notion that appealed to many educated and
discriminating men and women, and not only to the revolutionary minority...And
it is also my contention that while genocide was not in fact committed, what
happened during and as a result of the clearances had the look of genocide to a
great many Irish..." Historian Cormac Ã“ GrÃ¡da disagreed that the famine was
genocide: first, that "genocide includes murderous intent and it must be said
that not even the most bigoted and racist commentators of the day sought the
extermination of the Irish"; second, that most people in Whitehall "hoped for
better times in Ireland" and third, that the claim of genocide overlooks "the
enormous challenges facing relief efforts, both central, local, public and
private". Ã“ GrÃ¡da thinks that a case of neglect is easier to sustain than
that of genocide. Edward Lengel claims that views of the Irish as racially
inferior, and for this reason significantly responsible for their
circumstances, gained purchase in Great Britain during and immediately after
the famine, especially through influential publications such as "The Medical
Times" and "The Times". Memorials. The Great Famine is memorialised in many
locations throughout Ireland, especially in those regions that suffered the
greatest losses, and also in cities overseas with large populations descended
from Irish immigrants. These include, at Custom House Quays, Dublin, the thin
sculptural figures, by artist Rowan Gillespie, who stand as if walking towards
the emigration ships on the Dublin Quayside. There is also a large memorial at
the Murrisk Millennium Peace Park at the foot of Croagh Patrick in County Mayo.
Among the memorials in the U.S. is the Irish Hunger Memorial near a section of
the Manhattan waterfront in New York City, where many fleeing Irish arrived. An
annual Great Famine walk, the brainchild of the Irish author/humanitarian, Don
Mullan, from Doolough to Louisburgh, Co. Mayo, was inaugurated in 1988 and has
been led by such notable personalities as Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South
Africa and the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma. The walk, organised by AFrI (Action
From Ireland), takes place on the first or second Saturday of May and links the
memory of the Great Hunger with a contemporary Human Rights issue.
Commemorating the Doolough Tragedy, the walk was covered by the three major US
television networks: ABC, NBC and CBS, during its first three years.
