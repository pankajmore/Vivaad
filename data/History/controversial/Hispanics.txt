Hispanic Hispanic (; , ) is an ethnonym that denotes a relationship to Spain
or, in some definitions, to ancient Hispania, which comprised the Iberian
Peninsula including the modern states of Andorra, Portugal, and Spain and the
British Crown Dependency of Gibraltar. Today, organizations in the United
States use the term to refer to persons with a historical and cultural
relationship either with Spain and Portugal or with only Spain. Some
organizations intend to encapsulate only the Spanish-speaking populations in
the term "Hispanic", limiting the definition to that subset, while others
encapsulate Spain and Portugal in the term "Hispanic." The term is more broadly
used to refer to the culture, peoples, or nations with a historical link to
Spain, especially those countries which were once colonized by Spain,
particularly the countries of Latin America which were colonized by Spain. The
Hispanic culture is a set of customs, traditions, beliefs and art forms (music,
literature, dress, architecture, cuisine or others) which are generally shared
by peoples in Hispanic regions, but which can vary considerably from one
country or territory to another. The Spanish language is the main cultural
element shared by Hispanic peoples. Terminology. The term "Hispanic" is derived
from "Hispanicus" (which derived from "Hispania"), "Hispania" may in turn
derive from Latin "Hispanicus", or from Greek ŒôœÉœÄŒ±ŒΩŒØŒ± "Hispania" and
ŒôœÉœÄŒ±ŒΩœåœÇ "Hispanos", probably from Celtiberian or from Basque "Ezpanna".
In English the word is attested from the 16th century (and in late 19th century
in American English). The words "Spain", "Spanish", and "Spaniard" are of the
same etymology as "Hispanus", ultimately. "Hispanus" was the Latin name given
to a person from Hispania during Roman rule. In English, the term "Hispano-
Roman" is sometimes used. The Hispano-Romans were composed of people from many
different tribes. Some famous "Hispani" (plural of "Hispanus") were Marcus
Annaeus Lucanus, Martial, Prudentius, Theodosius I, and also Magnus Maximus and
Maximus of Hispania. Hispania was the Roman name for the whole territory of the
Iberian Peninsula. Initially, Hispania was divided into two provinces: Hispania
Citerior and Hispania Ulterior. In 27 b.C, Hispania Ulterior was divided into
two new provinces, Hispania Baetica and Hispania Lusitania, while Hispania
Citerior was renamed Hispania Tarraconensis. This division of Hispania explains
the usage of the singular and plural forms (Spain, and The Spains) used to
refer to the peninsula and its kingdoms in the Middle Ages. Prior to the
marriage of Queen Isabella I of Castile and King Ferdinand II of Aragon in
1469, the four Christian kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula, namely the Kingdom
of Portugal, the Crown of Aragon, the Crown of Castile, and the Kingdom of
Navarre, were collectively referred to as The Spains. This revival of the old
Roman name in the Middle Ages appears to have originated in Proven√ßal, and
appears to be first documented at the end of the 11th century. In the Council
of Constance, the four kingdoms shared one vote. The word "Lusitanian", chiefly
poetic, relates to Lusitania or Portugal, also in reference to the Lusitanians,
one of the first Indo-European tribes to settle in Europe. From this tribe's
name had derived the name of the Roman province of Lusitania, and "Lusitania"
remains Portugal's name in Latin. The terms "Spain" and " the Spains" were not
interchangeable. Spain was a geographic territory home to several kingdoms
(Christian and Muslim), with separate governments, laws, languages, religions,
and costumes and was also the historical remnant of the Hispano-Gothic unity.
Spain was not a political entity until much later, and when referring to the
Middle Ages one should not be confounded with the nation-state of today. The
term "The Spains" referred specifically to a collective of juridico-political
units, that is, it first referred only to the Christian kingdoms, then to the
different kingdoms ruled by the same king. With the Decretos de Nueva Planta,
Philip V started to organize the fusion of his kingdoms that until then were
ruled as distinct and independent, but this unification process lacked a formal
and juridic proclamation. Although colloquially and literarilly the expression
"King of Spain" or "King of the Spains" was already widespread, it did not
refer to a unified nation-state. It was only in the constitution of 1812 that
was adopted the name "Espa√±as" (Spains) for the Spanish nation and the use of
the title of "king of the Spains". The constitution of 1876 adopts for the
first time the name "Spain" for the Spanish nation and from then on the kings
would use the title of "king of Spain". The expansion of the Spanish Empire
between 1492 and 1898 brought thousands of Spanish migrants to the conquered
lands, who established settlements, mainly in the Americas but also in other
distant parts of the world, like in the Philippines being the lone Spanish
territory in Asia, producing a number of multiracial populations. Today the
term "Hispanic" is typically applied to the varied populations of these places,
including those with insignificant or no Spanish ancestry. Definitions in
ancient Rome. The Latin gentile adjectives that belong to Hispania are
Hispanus, Hispanicus and Hispanienses. Hispanus is some one who is a native of
Hispania with no foreign parents, while children born in Hispania of roman
parents were Hispaniensis. Hispaniensis means connected in some way to Hispania
as in "Exercitus Hispaniensis" or "mercatore Hispanienses", that means those
who are located in Hispania. While Hispanicus means "of" or "belonging to"
Hispania or the Hispanus or of their fashion as in "glaudius Hispanicus". The
gentile adjectives were not ethnolinguistic but derived primarily on a
geographic basis, from the toponym Hispania as the people of Hispania spoke
different languages, although Livy said they could all understand each other,
not making clear if they spoke dialects of the same language or were polyglots.
The first recorded use of an anthroponym derived from the toponym Hispania is
attested in one of the five fragments, of Quinto Ennius in 236 b.c who wrote
"Hispane, non Romane memoretis loqui me" (remember I speak "hispane" not roman)
as having been said by a native of Hispania. Definitions in Portugal and Spain.
In Portugal, Hispanic always refers to something related to Hispania, Spain or
the Spanish language and culture. Portugal and Spain have the same definition
for the term Hispanic (pt: "hisp√¢nico", es: "hisp√°nico"). The term signifies
the cultural resonance, among other elements and characteristics, of the
descendants of the people who inhabited ancient Hispania. It has been used
throughout history for purposes such as, but not limited to, drawing a contrast
to the moors and differentiating explorers and settlers. The portuguese and
partly the catalans do not want the peninsula, which today comprises only two
countries Portugal and Spain, to be named hispanic. Spainwas one of the several
historical names given to the Iberian peninsula in the past. Today Spain is a
country, and the adjective hispanico pertains to the Spanish people, language
and culture. In Spanish, another term, "hispano" as in Hispano-Americano,
refers to the people of Spanish origin who live in the Americas; it also refers
to a relationship to Hispania or to the Spanish language. Definitions in the
United States. The U.S. Office of Management and Budget currently defines
"Hispanic or Latino" as "a person of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, South or
Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race". The
2010 Census asked if the person was "Spanish/Hispanic/Latino". The U.S.
Department of Transportation defines "Hispanic" as, "persons of Mexican, Puerto
Rican, Cuban, Dominican, Central or South American, or other Spanish or
Portuguese culture or origin, regardless of race." This definition has been
adopted by the Small Business Administration as well as by many federal, state,
and municipal agencies for the purposes of awarding government contracts to
minority owned businesses. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the
Congressional Hispanic Conference include representatives of Spanish and
Portuguese descent. The Hispanic Society of America is dedicated to the study
of the arts and cultures of Spain, Portugal, and Latin America. The Hispanic
Association of Colleges and Universities, proclaimed champions of Hispanic
success in higher education, is committed to Hispanic educational success in
the U.S., Puerto Rico, Latin America, Spain, and Portugal. The U.S. Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission encourages any individual who believes that
he or she is Hispanic to self-identify as Hispanic. The United States
Department of Labor - Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs encourages
the same self-identification. As a result, any individual who traces his or her
origins to part of the Spanish Empire or Portuguese Empire may self-identify as
Hispanic, because an employer may not override an individual's self-
identification. The 1970 Census was the first time that a "Hispanic" identifier
was used and data collected with the question. The definition of "Hispanic" has
been modified in each successive census. In a recent study, most Spanish-
speakers of Spanish or Latin American descent do not prefer the term
‚ÄúHispanic‚Äù or ‚ÄúLatino‚Äù when it comes to describing their identity.
Instead, they prefer to be identified by their country of origin. When asked if
they have a preference for either being identified as ‚ÄúHispanic‚Äù or
‚ÄúLatino,‚Äù the Pew study finds that ‚Äúhalf (51%) say they have no
preference for either term.‚Äù If they did have to choose, the study finds that
‚Äú‚ÄôHispanic‚Äô is preferred over ‚ÄòLatino‚Äô by more than a two-to-one
margin‚Äî33% versus 14%.‚Äù Hispanicization. Hispanicization is the process by
which a place or a person absorbs characteristics of Hispanic society and
culture. Modern hispanization of a place, namely in the United States, might be
illustrated by Spanish-language media and businesses. Hispanization of a person
might be illustrated by speaking Spanish, making and eating Latin food,
listening to Spanish language music or participating in Hispanic festivals and
holidays - Hispanization of those outside the Hispanic community as opposed to
assimilation of Hispanics into theirs. One reason the assimilation of Hispanics
in the U.S. is not comparable to that of other cultural groups is that Hispanic
and Latino Americans have been living in parts of North America for centuries,
in many cases well before the English-speaking culture became dominant. For
example, California, Texas, Colorado, New Mexico (1598), Arizona, Nevada,
Florida and Puerto Rico have been home to Spanish-speaking peoples since the
16th century, long before the U.S. existed. These and other Spanish-speaking
territories were part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain, and later Mexico (with
the exception of Florida and Puerto Rico), before these regions joined or were
taken over by the United States in 1848. Some cities in the U.S. were founded
by Spanish settlers as early as the 16th century, prior to the creation of the
Thirteen Colonies. For example, San Miguel de Galdape, Pensacola and St.
Augustine, Florida were founded in 1526, 1559 and 1565 respectively. Santa Fe,
New Mexico was founded in 1604, and Albuquerque was established in 1660. El
Paso was founded in 1659, San Antonio in 1691, Laredo, Texas in 1755, San Diego
in 1769, San Francisco in 1776, San Jose, California in 1777, and Los Angeles
in 1781. Therefore, in many parts of the U.S., the Hispanic cultural legacy
predates British influence. For this reason, many generations have largely
maintained their cultural traditions and Spanish language well before the
United States was created. However, Spanish-speaking persons in many Hispanic
areas in the U.S. amounted to only a few thousand people when they became part
of the United States; a large majority of current Hispanic residents are
descended from Hispanics who entered the United States in the mid-to-late 20th
and early 21st centuries. Language retention is a common index to assimilation;
according to the 2000 census, about 75 percent of all Hispanics spoke Spanish
in the home. Spanish language retention rates vary geographically; parts of
Texas and New Mexico have language retention rates over 90 percent, whereas in
parts of Colorado and California, retention rates are lower than 30 percent.
The degree of retention of Spanish as the native language is based on recent
arrival from countries where Spanish is spoken. As is true of other immigrants,
those who were born in other countries still speak their native language. Later
generations are increasingly less likely to speak the language spoken in the
country of their ancestors, as is true of other immigrant groups. Language and
ethnicities in Portuguese-speaking areas around the world. The mandatory
offering of Portuguese in school curricula is observed in Uruguay and
Argentina. Other countries where Portuguese is taught at schools or is being
introduced now include Venezuela, Zambia, Congo, Senegal, Namibia, Swaziland,
C√¥te d'Ivoire, and South Africa. The closest language to Portuguese is
Galician, spoken in the autonomous community of Galicia (northwestern Spain).
The two were at one time a single language, known today as Galician-Portuguese,
but since the political separation of Portugal from Galicia they have diverged,
especially in pronunciation and vocabulary. Nevertheless, the core vocabulary
and grammar of Galician are still noticeably closer to Portuguese than to those
of Spanish. In particular, like Portuguese, it uses the future subjunctive, the
personal infinitive, and the synthetic pluperfect. Mutual intelligibility
(estimated at 85% by R. A. Hall, Jr., 1989) is very good between Galicians and
northern Portuguese, but poorer between Galicians and speakers from central
Portugal. Nevertheless, many renowned linguists still consider Galician to be a
dialect of the Portuguese language. Portuguese has provided loanwords to many
languages, such as Indonesian, Manado Malay, Sri Lankan Tamil and Sinhalese,
Malay, Bengali, English, Hindi, Swahili, Afrikaans, Konkani, Marathi, Tetum,
Xitsonga, Papiamentu, Japanese, Lanc-Patu√° (spoken in northern Brazil), Esan
and Sranan Tongo (spoken in Suriname). It left a strong influence on the
l√≠ngua bras√≠lica, a Tupi‚ÄìGuaran√≠ language, which was the most widely
spoken in Brazil until the 18th century, and on the language spoken around
Sikka in Flores Island, Indonesia. In nearby Larantuka, Portuguese is used for
prayers in Holy Week rituals. The Japanese‚ÄìPortuguese dictionary Nippo Jisho
(1603) was the first dictionary of Japanese in a European language, a product
of Jesuit missionary activity in Japan. Building on the work of earlier
Portuguese missionaries, the Dictionarium Anamiticum, Lusitanum et Latinum
(Annamite‚ÄìPortuguese‚ÄìLatin dictionary) of Alexandre de Rhodes (1651)
introduced the modern orthography of Vietnamese, which is based on the
orthography of 17th-century Portuguese. The Romanization of Chinese was also
influenced by the Portuguese language (among others), particularly regarding
Chinese surnames; one example is Mei. During 1583‚Äì88 Italian Jesuits Michele
Ruggieri and Matteo Ricci created a Portuguese‚ÄìChinese dictionary‚Äîthe first
ever European‚ÄìChinese dictionary. Community of Portuguese Language Countries
(CPLP). The CPLP was formed in 1996 with seven countries: Portugal, Brazil,
Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, and S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe.
East Timor joined the community in 2002 after gaining independence. The CPLP is
a bloc in the process of construction and the societies of the eight member
nations have little knowledge of each other. One of the features of the CPLP is
that its members are linked by a common language and shared cultural features,
which form a bridge among countries separated by great distances and on
different continents. In 2005, during a meeting in Luanda, the ministers of
culture of the eight countries declared the 5 May as the Lusophone Culture Day
(Dia da Cultura Lus√≥fona in Portuguese). In July 2006, during the Bissau
summit, Equatorial Guinea and Mauritius were admitted as Associate Observers
along with 17 International associations and organizations considered as
Consultative Observers. When the CPLP was formed, Equatorial Guinea asked for
observer status. Equatorial Guinea (Portuguese: Guin√© Equatorial) was a
Portuguese colony from the 15th to 18th centuries and has some territories
where Portuguese-based creole languages are spoken and cultural connections
with S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe and Portugal are felt. Also, the country has
recently cooperated with Portuguese-speaking African countries and Brazil at an
educational level. At the CPLP summit of July 2004, in S√£o Tom√© and
Pr√≠ncipe, the member states agreed to change the statutes of the community to
accept states as associate observers. Equatorial Guinea is in discussion for
full membership. In June 2010, Equatorial Guinea asked to be admitted as full
member. At its 8th summit in Luanda in July 2010, the CPLP decided to open
formal negotiations with Equatorial Guinea about full membership in the CPLP.
Mauritius, which was unknown to Europeans until the Portuguese sailed there and
has strong connections with Mozambique, also obtained associate observer status
in 2006. In 2008, Senegal, with historical connections to Portuguese
colonisation in Casamance, was admitted as Associate Observer The Portuguese-
speaking countries are home to more than 240 million people located across the
globe but having cultural similarities and a shared history. The CPLP nations
have a combined area of about 10,742,000 square kilometres (4,148,000 sq mi),
which is larger than Canada. Since its formation, the CPLP has helped to solve
problems in S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe and in Guinea-Bissau, because of coups
d'√©tat in those countries. These two problems were solved, and in fact, have
helped these two countries to take economic reforms (in the case of S√£o Tom√©)
and democratic ones (in the case of Guinea-Bissau). The leaders of the CPLP
believe that peace in Angola and Mozambique as well as East Timor's
independence favors the further development of the CPLP and a strengthening of
multilateral cooperation. Since many children in rural areas of Lusophone
Africa and East Timor are out-of-school youth, the education officials in these
regions seek help from Portugal and Brazil to increase the education to spread
Portuguese fluency (like establishing Instituto Cam√µes language center
branches in main cities and rural towns), as Portuguese is becoming one of the
main languages in Southern Africa, where it is also taught in Namibia and South
Africa. In many developing Portuguese-speaking nations, Portuguese is the
language of government and commerce which means that Portuguese speaking people
from African nations can work and communicate with others in different parts of
the world, especially in Portugal and Brazil, where the economies are stronger.
Many leaders of Portuguese-speaking nations in Africa are fearful that language
standards do not meet the fluency required and are therefore making it
compulsory in schools so that a higher degree of fluency is achieved and young
Africans will be able to speak a world language that will help them later in
life. Angola and Mozambique have not yet signed the most recent accord on the
orthography of the Portuguese language, and have asked other PALOP countries to
support them in discussions on various points of that accord with Portugal.
Spanish-speaking countries and regions. Today, Spanish is among the most
commonly spoken first languages of the world. During the period of the Spanish
Empire from 1492 and 1898, many people migrated from Spain to the conquered
lands. The Spaniards brought with them the Castillian language and culture, and
in this process that lasted several centuries, created a global empire with a
diverse population. Miscegenation between peoples in the colonies led to the
creation of the new mixed peoples, chiefly half-caste and mulattos, in many
countries. Culturally, Spaniards are typically European, but they also have
small traces of many peoples from the rest of Europe, the Near East and the
Mediterranean areas of northern Africa. The Hispanic countries, including
Spain, are also inhabited by peoples of non-Spanish ancestry, to widely varying
extents. Music. Folk and popular dance and music also varies greatly among
Hispanics. For instance, the music from Spain is a lot different from the
Hispanic American, although there is a high grade of exchange between both
continents. In addition, due to the high national development of the diverse
nationalities and regions of Spain, there is a lot of music in the different
languages of the Peninsula (Catalan, Galician and Basque, mainly). See, for
instance, Music of Catalonia or Rock catal√ , Music of Galicia, Cantabria and
Asturias, and Basque music. Flamenco is also a very popular music style in
Spain, especially in Andalusia. Spanish ballads "romances" can be traced in
Mexico as "corridos" or in Argentina as "milongas", same structure but
different scenarios. On the other side of the ocean, Latin America is also home
to a wide variety of music, even though "Latin" music is often erroneously
thought of, as a single genre. Hispanic Caribbean music tends to favor complex
polyrhythms of African origin. Mexican music shows combined influences of
mostly Spanish and Native American origin, while traditional Northern Mexican
music ‚Äî norte√±o and banda ‚Äî is more influenced by country-and-western
music and the polka, brought by Central European settlers to Mexico. The music
of Hispanic Americans ‚Äî such as tejano music ‚Äî has influences in rock,
jazz, R&B, pop, and country music as well as traditional Mexican music such as
Mariachi. Meanwhile, native Andean sounds and melodies are the backbone of
Peruvian and Bolivian music, but also play a significant role in the popular
music of most South American countries and are heavily incorporated into the
folk music of Ecuador and Chile and the tunes of Colombia, and again in Chile
where they play a fundamental role in the form of the greatly followed nueva
canci√≥n. In U.S. communities of immigrants from these countries it is common
to hear these styles. Latin pop, Rock en Espa√±ol, Latin hip-hop, Salsa,
Merengue, colombian cumbia and Reggaeton styles tend to appeal to the broader
Hispanic population, and varieties of Cuban music are popular with many
Hispanics of all backgrounds. Literature. Spanish Language literature and
folklore is very rich and is influenced by a variety of countries. There are
thousands of writers from many places, and dating from the Middle Ages to the
present. Some of the most recognized writers are Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra
(Spain), Lope de Vega (Spain), Calder√≥n de la Barca (Spain), Carlos Fuentes
(Mexico), Octavio Paz (Mexico), Miguel √Ångel Asturias (Guatemala), George
Santayana (US), Jos√© Mart√≠ (Cuba), Sabine Ulibarri (US), Federico Garc√≠a
Lorca (Spain), Miguel de Unamuno (Spain), Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez (Colombia),
Rafael Pombo (Colombia), Horacio Quiroga (Uruguay), R√≥mulo Gallegos
(Venezuela), Rub√©n Dar√≠o (Nicaragua), Mario Vargas Llosa (Peru), Giannina
Braschi (Puerto Rico), Cristina Peri Rossi (Uruguay), Luisa Valenzuela
(Argentina), Roberto Quesada (Honduras), Julio Cort√°zar (Argentina), Pablo
Neruda (Chile), Gabriela Mistral (Chile), Jorge Luis Borges (Argentina), Pedro
Henr√≠quez Ure√±a (Dominican Republic), Ernesto Sabato (Argentina), Juan Tom√°s
√Åvila Laurel (Equatorial Guinea), Ciro Alegr√≠a (Peru), Joaquin Garcia Monge
(Costa Rica), and Jos√© Rizal (Philippines). Religion. With regard to religious
affiliation among Spanish-speakers, Christianity ‚Äî specifically Roman
Catholicism ‚Äî is usually the first religious tradition that comes to mind.
The Spaniards took the Roman Catholic faith to Latin America and the
Philippines, and Roman Catholicism continues to be the predominant religion
amongst most Hispanics. A small but growing number of Hispanics belong to a
Protestant denomination. There are also Spanish-speaking Jews, most of whom are
the descendants of Ashkenazi Jews who migrated from Europe (German Jews,
Russian Jews, Polish Jews, etc.) to Latin America, particularly Argentina,
Uruguay, Peru and Cuba (Argentina is host to the third largest Jewish
population in the Western Hemisphere, after the United States and Canada) in
the 19th century and following World War II. Many Spanish-speaking Jews also
originate from the small communities of reconverted descendants of anusim ‚Äî
those whose Spanish and Portuguese Sephardi Jewish ancestors long ago hid their
Jewish ancestry and beliefs in fear of persecution by the Spanish Inquisition
and Portuguese Inquisition in the Iberian Peninsula and Latin America. The
Spanish Inquisition led to a large number of forced conversions of Spanish
Jews. Genetic studies on the (male) Y-chromosome conducted by the University of
Leeds in 2008 appear to support the idea that the number of forced conversions
have been previously underestimated significantly. They found that twenty
percent of Spanish males have Y-chromosomes associated with Sephardic Jewish
ancestry. This may imply that there were more forced conversions than was
previously thought. There are also thought to be many Catholic-professing
descendants of marranos and Spanish-speaking crypto-Jews in the Southwestern
United States and scattered through Latin America. Additionally, there are
Sephardic Jews who are descendants of those Jews who fled Spain to Turkey,
Syria, and North Africa, some of whom have now migrated to Latin America,
holding on to some Spanish/Sephardic customs, such as the Ladino language which
mixes Spanish, Hebrew, Arabic and others, though written with Hebrew and Latin
characters. Though, it should be noted, that Ladinos were also African slaves
captive in Spain held prior to the colonial period in the Americas. (See also
History of the Jews in Latin America and List of Latin American Jews.) Among
the Spanish-speaking Catholics, most communities celebrate their homeland's
patron saint, dedicating a day for this purpose with festivals and religious
services. Some Spanish-speakers syncretize Roman Catholicism and African or
Native American rituals and beliefs. Such is the case of Santer√≠a, popular
with Afro-Cubans, which combines old African beliefs in the form of Roman
Catholic saints and rituals. Other syncretistic beliefs include Spiritism and
Curanderismo. While a tiny minority, there are some Muslims in Latin America,
in the US, and in the Philippines, living predominantly in Mindanao, the of
home of Islam in the Philippines. In the United States, some 70% of Hispanics
and Latinos report themselves Catholic and 23% Protestant, with 6% having no
affiliation. A minority among the Roman Catholics, about one in five, are
charismatics. Among the Protestant, 85% are "Born-again Christians" and belong
to Evangelical or Pentecostal churches. Among the smallest groups, less than
4%, are Jewish.
