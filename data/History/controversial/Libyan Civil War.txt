Libyan civil war The Libyan civil war, also referred to as the Libyan
revolution was an armed conflict in the North African state of Libya, fought
between forces loyal to Colonel Muammar Gaddafi and those seeking to oust his
government. The war was preceded by protests in Benghazi beginning on Tuesday,
15 February 2011, which led to clashes with security forces that fired on the
crowd. The protests escalated into a rebellion that spread across the country,
with the forces opposing Gaddafi establishing an interim governing body, the
National Transitional Council. The United Nations Security Council passed an
initial resolution on 26 February, freezing the assets of Gaddafi and his inner
circle and restricting their travel, and referred the matter to the
International Criminal Court for investigation. In early March, Gaddafi's
forces rallied, pushed eastwards and re-took several coastal cities before
reaching Benghazi. A further U.N. resolution authorised member states to
establish and enforce a no-fly zone over Libya, and to use "all necessary
measures" to prevent attacks on civilians. The Gaddafi government then
announced a ceasefire, but failed to uphold it, though it then accused rebels
of violating the ceasefire when they continued to fight as well. Throughout the
conflict, rebels rejected government offers of a ceasefire and efforts by the
African Union to end the fighting because the plans set forth did not include
the removal of Gaddafi. In August, rebel forces began a coastal offensive,
taking back territory lost weeks before and ultimately capturing the capital
city of Tripoli, while Gaddafi evaded capture and loyalists engaged in a
rearguard campaign. On 16 September 2011, the National Transitional Council was
recognised by the United Nations as the legal representative of Libya,
replacing the Gaddafi government. Muammar Gaddafi remained at large until 20
October 2011, when he was captured and killed attempting to escape from Sirte.
The National Transitional Council "declared the liberation of Libya" and the
official end of the war on 23 October 2011. Amidst the aftermath of the civil
war, a low-level insurgency by former Gaddafi loyalists still continued. There
have been various disagreements and strife between local militia and tribes,
including 23 January 2012 fighting in the former Gaddafi stronghold of Bani
Walid, leading to an alternative town council being established and later
recognized by the NTC. A much greater issue has been the role of militias which
fought in the civil war and their role in the new Libya. Some have refused to
disarm and cooperation with the NTC has been strained, leading to
demonstrations against militias and government action to disband such groups or
integrate them into the Libyan military. Background. Leadership. Muammar
Gaddafi became the de facto ruler of Libya after he led a military coup that
overthrew King Idris I in 1969. He abolished the Libyan Constitution of 1951,
and adopted laws based on his own ideology outlined in his manifesto "The Green
Book". He officially stepped down from power in 1977, and subsequently claimed
to be merely a "symbolic figurehead" until 2011, with the Libyan government up
until then also denying that he held any power. Under Gaddafi, Libya was
theoretically a decentralized, direct democracy state run according to the
philosophy of Gaddafi's "The Green Book", with Gaddafi retaining a ceremonial
position. Libya was officially run by a system of people's committees which
served as local governments for the country's subdivisions, an indirectly
elected General People's Congress as the legislature, and the General People's
Committee, led by a Secretary-General, as the executive branch. According to
Freedom House, however, these structures were often manipulated to ensure the
dominance of Gaddafi, who reportedly continued to dominate all aspects of
government. WikiLeaks' disclosure of confidential US diplomatic cables revealed
US diplomats there speaking of Gaddafi's "mastery of tactical manoeuvring".
While placing relatives and loyal members of his tribe in central military and
government positions, he skillfully marginalized supporters and rivals, thus
maintaining a delicate balance of powers, stability and economic developments.
This extended even to his own sons, as he repeatedly changed affections to
avoid the rise of a clear successor and rival. According to several Western
media sources, Gaddafi feared a military coup against his government and
deliberately kept Libya's military relatively weak. The Libyan Army consisted
of about 50,000 personnel. Its most powerful units were four crack brigades of
highly equipped and trained soldiers, composed of members of Gaddafi's tribe or
members of other tribes loyal to him. One, the Khamis Brigade, was led by his
son Khamis. Local militias and Revolutionary Committees across the country were
also kept well-armed. By contrast, regular military units were poorly armed and
trained, and were armed with largely outdated military equipment. According to
Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, however, the reason for the country's de-militarization
was a reaction to the Iraq War, so that Libya wouldn't be accused of possessing
weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) and face the same fate. He also accused NATO
of betraying their trust and taking advantage of this weakness to launch an air
attack, recommending that other nations build up their military defences in
order to avoid facing the same fate as Libya. Development and corruption. Much
of the state's income came from its oil production, which soared in the 1970s.
In the 1980s, a large portion of it was spent on arms purchases, and on
sponsoring militant groups and independence movements around the world.
Petroleum revenues contributed up to 58% of Libya's GDP. Governments with
resource curse revenue have a lower need for taxes from other industries and
consequently feel less pressure to develop their middle class. To calm
opposition, they can use the income from natural resources to offer services to
the population, or to specific government supporters. Libya's oil wealth being
spread over a relatively small population gave it a higher GDP per capita than
in neighbouring states. Libya's GDP per capita (PPP), human development index,
and literacy rate were better than in Egypt and Tunisia, whose Arab Spring
revolutions preceded the outbreak of protests in Libya. Libya's corruption
perception index in 2010 was 2.2, ranking 146th out of 178 countries, worse
than that of Egypt (ranked 98th) and Tunisia (ranked 59th). One paper
speculated that such a situation created a broader contrast between good
education, high demand for democracy, and the government's practices (perceived
corruption, political system, supply of democracy). More than 16% of families
had none of its members earning a stable income, while 43.3% had just one.
Despite one of the highest unemployment rates in the region, there was a
consistent labor shortage with over a million migrant workers present on the
market. These migrant workers formed the bulk of the refugees leaving Libya
after the beginning of hostilities. Despite this, Libya's Human Development
Index in 2010 was the highest in Africa and greater than that of Saudi Arabia.
Libya had welfare systems allowing access to free education, free healthcare,
and financial assistance for housing, while the Great Manmade River was built
to allow free access to fresh water across large parts of the country. Some of
the worst economic conditions were in the eastern parts of the state, once a
breadbasket of the ancient world, where Gaddafi extracted oil. Despite
improvements in housing and the Great Manmade River allowing access to free
fresh water, not much infrastructure beyond this was developed in the region
for many years, with the only sewage facility in Benghazi being over 40 years
old, and untreated sewage has resulted in environmental problems. Several
foreign governments and analysts have claimed that a large share of the
business enterprise was controlled by Gaddafi, his family, and the government.
A leaked US diplomatic cable claimed that the Libyan economy was "a kleptocracy
in which the government ‚Äì either the Gaddafi family itself or its close
political allies ‚Äì has a direct stake in anything worth buying, selling or
owning". According to US officials, Gaddafi amassed a vast personal fortune
during his 42-year leadership. "The New York Times" pointed to Gaddafi's
relatives adopting lavish lifestyles, including luxurious homes, Hollywood film
investments, and private parties with American pop stars. Gaddafi claimed he
was planning to combat corruption in the state by proposing reforms where oil
profits are handed out directly to the country's five million people rather
than to government bodies, stating that "as long as money is administered by a
government body, there would be theft and corruption." Gaddafi urged a sweeping
reform of the government bureaucracy, suggesting that most of the cabinet
system should be dismantled to "free Libyans from red tape" and "protect the
state's budget from corruption." According to Western diplomats, this move
appeared to be aimed at putting pressure on the government to speed up reforms.
In March 2008, Gaddafi proposed plans to dissolve the country's existing
administrative structure and disburse oil revenue directly to the people. The
plan included abolishing all ministries except those of defence, internal
security, and foreign affairs, and departments implementing strategic projects.
He claimed that the ministries were failing to manage the country‚Äôs oil
revenues, and that his "dream during all these years was to give power and
wealth directly to the people." A national vote on Gaddafi's plan to disband
the government and give oil money directly to the people was held in 2009,
where Libya's people's congresses, collectively the country's highest
authority, voted to delay implementation. The General People's Congress
announced that, out of 468 Basic People's Congresses, 64 chose immediate
implementation while 251 endorsed implementation "but asked for (it) to be
delayed until appropriate measures were put in place." This plan led to dissent
from top government officials, who claimed it would "wreak havoc" in the
economy by "fanning inflation and spurring capital flight." Gaddafi
acknowledged that the scheme, which promised up to 30,000 Libyan dinars
($23,000) annually to about a million of Libya's poorest, may "cause chaos
before it brought about prosperity," but claimed "do not be afraid to
experiment with a new form of government" and that "this plan is to offer a
better future for Libya's children." Human rights in Libya. In 2009 and 2011,
the Freedom of the Press Index rated Libya the most-censored state in the
Middle East and North Africa. In contrast, a January 2011 report of the United
Nations Human Rights Council, on which the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya sat prior to
the uprising, released a month before protests began, praised certain aspects
of the country's human rights record, including its treatment of women and
improvements in other areas. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya's delegation to the
United Nations issued a report about human rights in Libya. The report claimed
that the country was founded on direct people's democracy that guaranteed
direct exercise of authority by all citizens through the people's congresses.
Citizens were claimed to be able to express opinions of the congresses on
issues related to political, economic, social, and cultural issues. In
addition, the report claimed that there were information platforms such as
newspapers and TV channels for people to express their opinions through. Libyan
authorities also argued that no one in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya suffered from
extreme poverty and hunger, and that the government guaranteed a minimum of
food and essential needs to people with low incomes. In 2006, an initiative was
adopted for providing people with low incomes investment portfolios amounting
to $30,000 to be deposited with banks and companies. The Revolutionary
Committees occasionally kept tight control over internal dissent; reportedly,
ten to twenty percent of Libyans worked as informants for these committees,
with surveillance taking place in the government, in factories, and in the
education sector. The government sometimes executed dissidents through public
hangings and mutilations and re-broadcast them on public television channels.
Up to the mid-1980s, Libya's intelligence service conducted assassinations of
Libyan dissidents around the world. In December 2009, Gaddafi reportedly told
government officials that Libya would soon experience a "new political period"
and would have elections for important positions such as minister-level roles
and the National Security Advisor position (a Prime Minister equivalent). He
also promised that international monitors would be included to ensure fair
elections. His speech was said to have caused quite a stir. These elections
were planned to coincide with the Jamahiriya's usual periodic elections for the
Popular Committees, Basic People's Committees, Basic People's Congresses, and
General People's Congresses, in 2010. Dissent was illegal under Law 75 of 1973,
and in 1974, Gaddafi asserted that anyone guilty of founding a political party
would be executed. With the establishment of the Jamahiriya ("state of the
masses") system in 1977, he established the Revolutionary Committees as
conduits for raising political consciousness, with the aim of direct political
participation by all Libyans rather than a traditional party-based
representative system. In 1979, some of the Revolutionary Committees had
eventually evolved into self-appointed, sometimes zealous, enforcers of
revolutionary orthodoxy. During the early 1980s, the Revolutionary Committees
had considerable power and became a growing source of tension within the
Jamihiriya, to the extent that Gaddafi sometimes criticized their effectiveness
and excessive repression, until the power of the Revolutionary Committees were
eventually restricted in the late 1980s. "The Green Book", which Gaddafi
authored in the 1970s, was for years the principal text of political education.
BBC cited a Libyan who claimed that teachers who called it "rubbish" could face
execution. According to the Libyan Government, "the death penalty may not be
imposed except in tretribution (qisas) or on persons whose lives endanger or
corrupt society." In 1988, Gaddafi criticized the "excesses" he blamed on the
Revolutionary Councils, stating that "they deviated, harmed, tortured" and that
"the true revolutionary does not practise repression." That same year, the
Libyan Arab Jamahiriya issued the "Great Green Document on Human Rights", in
which Article 5 established laws that allowed greater freedom of expression.
Article 8 of The Code on the Promotion of Freedom stated that "each citizen has
the right to express his opinions and ideas openly in People‚Äôs Congresses and
in all mass media." A number of restrictions were also allegedly placed on the
power of the Revolutionary Committees by the Gaddafi government, leading to a
resurgence in the Libyan state's popularity by the early 1990s. In 2004,
however, Libya posted a $1¬ million bounty for journalist and governmental
critic Ashur Shamis, under the allegation that he was linked to Al-Qaeda and
terror suspect Abu Qatada. Anti-Gaddafi movement. Beginnings of protests.
Between 13 and 16 January 2011, upset at delays in the building of housing
units and over political corruption, protesters in Bayda, Derna, Benghazi and
other cities broke into, and occupied, housing that the government had been
building. Protesters also clashed with police in Bayda and attacked government
offices. By 27 January, the government had responded to the housing unrest with
a ‚Ç¨20¬ billion investment fund to provide housing and development. In late
January, Jamal al-Hajji, a writer, political commentator and accountant, "call
on the Internet for demonstrations to be held in support of greater freedoms in
Libya" inspired by the Tunisian and Egyptian revolutions. He was arrested on 1
February by plain-clothes police officers, and charged on 3 February with
injuring someone with his car. Amnesty International claimed that because al-
Hajji had previously been imprisoned for his non-violent political opinions,
the real reason for the present arrest appeared to be his call for
demonstrations. In early February, Gaddafi, on behalf of the Jamahiriya, met
with political activists, journalists and media figures and warned them that
they would be held responsible if they disturbed the peace or created chaos in
Libya. The protests would lead to an uprising and civil war, as part of the
wider Arab Spring, which had already resulted in the ousting of long-term
presidents of adjacent Tunisia and Egypt. Social media played a central role in
organizing the opposition. Uprising and civil war. The protests, unrest and
confrontations began in earnest on 15 February 2011. On the evening of 15
February, between 500 and 600 demonstrators protested in front of Benghazi's
police headquarters after the arrest of human rights lawyer Fathi Terbil.
Crowds were armed with petrol bombs and threw stones. Marchers hurled Molotov
cocktails in a downtown square in Benghazi, damaging cars, blocking roads, and
hurling rocks. Police responded to crowds with tear gas, water cannon, and
rubber bullets. 38 people were injured, among them ten security personnel. The
novelist Idris Al-Mesmari was arrested hours after giving an interview with "Al
Jazeera" about the police reaction to protests. In a statement released after
clashes in Benghazi, a Libyan official warned that the Government "will not
allow a group of people to move around at night and play with the security of
Libya". The statement added: "The clashes last night were between small groups
of people - up to 150. Some outsiders infiltrated that group. They were trying
to corrupt the local legal process which has long been in place. We will not
permit that at all, and we call on Libyans to voice their issues through
existing channels, even if it is to call for the downfall of the government."
In Bayda and Zintan, hundreds of protesters in each town called for an end to
the Gaddafi government and set fire to police and security buildings. In
Zintan, the protesters set up tents in the town centre. The armed protests
continued the following day in Benghazi, Derna and Bayda. Libyan security
forces allegedly responded with lethal force. Hundreds gathered at Maydan al-
Shajara in Benghazi, and authorities tried to disperse protesters with water
cannons. A "Day of Rage" in Libya and by Libyans in exile was planned for 17
February. The National Conference for the Libyan Opposition asked that all
groups opposed to the Gaddafi government protest on 17 February in memory of
demonstrations in Benghazi five years earlier. The plans to protest were
inspired by the Tunisian and Egyptian revolution. Protests took place in
Benghazi, Ajdabiya, Derna, Zintan, and Bayda. Libyan security forces fired live
ammunition into the armed protests. Protesters torched a number of government
buildings, including a police station. In Tripoli, television and public radio
stations had been sacked, and protesters set fire to security buildings,
Revolutionary Committee offices, the interior ministry building, and the
People's Hall. According to a report from the International Crisis Group, "much
Western media coverage has from the outset presented a very one-sided view of
the logic of events, portraying the protest movement as entirely peaceful and
repeatedly suggesting that the government's security forces were unaccountably
massacring unarmed demonstrators who presented no security challenge". On 18
February, police and army personnel later withdrew from Benghazi after being
overwhelmed by protesters. Some army personnel also joined the protesters; they
then seized the local radio station. In Bayda, unconfirmed reports indicated
that the local police force and riot-control units had joined the protesters.
On 19 February, witnesses in Libya reported helicopters firing into crowds of
anti-government protesters. The army withdrew from the city of Bayda. Cultural
revolt. Rap, hip hop and traditional music, alongside other genres, have played
a role in encouraging the dissidents to Gaddafi's government. Music has been
controlled and dissenting cultural figures have been arrested or tortured in
Arab Spring countries, including Libya. The music has provided an important
platform by means of communication among the demonstrators. The music has
helped create moral support and encouraged a spirit of resistance and revolt
against the governments. An anonymous hip hop artist called Ibn Thabit has
given a voice to "disenfranchised Libyans looking for a non-violent way to
express their political will". On his website, Ibn Thabit claims he "has been
attacking Gaddafi with his music since 2008" when he posted his first song on
the internet, titled "Moammar ‚Äì the coward". Lyrics of a song 'Al-Soo'al'
released by Ibn Thabit on YouTube on 27 January 2011, weeks before the riots
began in Libya are indicative of the rebel sentiment. Some groups, such as a
rock band from Benghazi called the "Guys Underground", used metaphors to cloak
the censure of the authorities. The group released a song just before the
uprising entitled "Like My Father Always Says" to ridicule an autocratic
fictional male head of a family which was a veiled reference to Colonel
Gaddafi. Organization. Many opposition participants have called for a return to
the 1952 constitution and a transition to multi-party democracy. Military units
who have joined the rebellion and many volunteers have formed an army to defend
against Jamahiriya attacks and to work to bring Tripoli under the influence of
Jalil. In Tobruk, volunteers turned a former headquarters of the government
into a centre for helping protesters. Volunteers reportedly guarded the port,
local banks and oil terminals to keep the oil flowing. Teachers and engineers
set up a committee to collect weapons. Likewise supply lines were run by
volunteers. For example, in Misrata people organised a pizza service which
delivered up to 8,000 pizzas a day to fighters. The National Transitional
Council () was established on 27 February in an effort to consolidate efforts
for change in the rule of Libya. The main objectives of the group did not
include forming an interim government, but instead to co-ordinate resistance
efforts between the different towns held in rebel control, and to give a
political "face" to the opposition to present to the world. The Benghazi-based
opposition government had called for a no-fly zone and airstrikes against the
Jamahiriya. The council refers to the Libyan state as the "Libyan Republic" and
it now has a website. Former Jamahiriya Justice Minister Mustafa Abdul Jalil
said in February that the new government would prepare for elections and they
could be held in three months. On 29 March, the political and international
affairs committee of the Council presented its eight-point plan for Libya in
"The Guardian" newspaper, stating they would hold free and fair elections and
draft a national constitution. An independent newspaper called "Libya" appeared
in Benghazi, as well as rebel-controlled radio stations. Some of the rebels
oppose tribalism and wear vests bearing slogans such as "No to tribalism, no to
factionalism". Libyans have said that they have found abandoned torture
chambers and devices that have been used in the past. Composition of rebel
forces. The rebels are composed primarily of civilians, such as teachers,
students, lawyers, and oil workers, and a contingent of professional soldiers
that defected from the Libyan Army and joined the rebels. The Islamist group
Libyan Islamic Fighting Group is considered part of the rebel movement, as is
the Obaida Ibn Jarrah Brigade which has been held responsible for the
assassination of top rebel commander General Abdul Fatah Younis. Gaddafi's
administration had repeatedly asserted that the rebels included al-Qaeda
fighters. NATO's Supreme Allied Commander James G. Stavridis stated that
intelligence reports suggested "flickers" of al-Qaeda activity were present
among the rebels, but also added that there is not sufficient information to
confirm there is any significant al-Qaeda or terrorist presence. Denials of al-
Qaeda membership were issued by the rebels. Gaddafi's claims are supported by a
secret cable to the State Department from the US embassy in Tripoli in 2008 and
an analysis by the Combating Terrorism Center at the US Military Academy at
West Point of a set of documents called the Sinjar Records, purporting to show
a statistical study of the al-Qaeda personnel records. The West Point analysis
of these documents concluded that Libya provided "far more" foreign fighters in
per capita terms than any other country. A disclosed file from 2005 on
WikiLeaks found that rebel leader Abu Sufian Ibrahim Ahmed Hamuda Bin Qumu was
a former Guantanamo Bay detainee alleged to be a member of the Libyan Islamic
Fighting Group, to have joined the Taliban in 1998, and that he was a
‚Äúprobable member of Al Qaida and a member of the African Extremist
Network.‚Äù State response. In the days leading up to the conflict, Gaddafi
called for a rally against the government that was to be held on 17 February.
The International Crisis Group believes this to have been a political manoeuvre
to divert attention away from himself and the Jamahiriya political system
towards government officials currently in power. Later in February, Gaddafi
claimed that the rebels were influenced by Al-Qaeda, Osama Bin Laden, and
hallucinogenic drugs put in drinks and pills. He specifically referred to
substances in milk, coffee, and Nescaf√©, and claimed that Bin Laden and Al-
Qaeda were distributing these hallucinogenic drugs. He also blamed alcohol.
Gaddafi later also claimed that the revolt against his rule was the result of a
colonialist plot by foreign states, particularly blaming France, the US and the
UK, to control oil and enslave the Libyan people. He referred to the rebels as
"cockroaches" and "rats", and vowed not to step down and to cleanse Libya house
by house until the insurrection was crushed. He said that if the rebels laid
down their arms, they would not be harmed. He also said that he had been
receiving "thousands" of phone calls from Benghazi, from residents who were
being held hostage and who wanted to be rescued. Gaddafi said in a speech
addressed to Benghazi on 17 March 2011 that the rebels "can run away, they can
go to Egypt...Those who would surrender their weapons and would join our side,
we are the people of Libya. Those who surrender their weapons and would come
without their arms, we would forgive them, and would have amnesty for those who
put down their weapons. Anyone who throws his arms away and stays at home would
be protected. Libya's ambassador in Malta explained that "many people
instigating unrest were arrested. Libya will show that these belonged to Al
Qaeda. Some young protestors were also misled. The government is ready to
dialogue with them." He cited reports from the Libyan Foreign Ministry that up
to 2,500 al-Qaeda foreign operatives have been working in eastern Libya and
were mostly responsible for "stirring up trouble." He concluded, ‚ÄúWhat we saw
in Tahrir Square, and in Tunisia, was a clear situation. But in Libya, there is
something different." He called himself a "warrior", and vowed to fight on and
die a "martyr", and urged his supporters to leave their homes and attack rebels
"in their lairs". Gaddafi claimed that he had not yet ordered the use of force,
and threatened that "everything will burn" when he did. Responding to demands
that he step down, he claimed that he could not step down, as he held a purely
symbolic position like Queen Elizabeth, and that the people were in power. The
Swedish peace research institute SIPRI reported flights between Tripoli and a
dedicated military base in Belarus which only handles stockpiled weaponry and
military equipment. Violence. Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, in an interview with ABC
on 17 March, stated that the rebels in Benghazi engaged in terror against the
population. He stated, "You know, the armoured militia yesterday, they killed
four young boys in Benghazi. Why? Because they were against them. Everybody is
terrified because of the armed militia. They live in terror. Nightmare. Armed
people are everywhere. They have their own courts. They execute the people who
are against them. No school. No hospital. No money. No banks." The Libyan
government were reported to have employed snipers, artillery, helicopter
gunships, warplanes, anti-aircraft weaponry, and warships against
demonstrations and funeral processions. It was also reported that security
forces and foreign mercenaries repeatedly used firearms, including assault
rifles and machine guns, as well as knives against protesters. Amnesty
International initially reported that writers, intellectuals and other
prominent opposition sympathizers disappeared during the early days of the
conflict in Gaddafi-controlled cities, and that they may have been subjected to
torture or execution. In a 17 March 2011 interview, shortly before the military
intervention, Muammar Gaddafi's son and "heir apparent" Saif al-Islam Gaddafi
claimed "armed militia" fighters in Benghazi were killing children and
terrorizing the population. Amnesty International also reported that security
forces targeted paramedics helping injured protesters. In multiple incidents,
Gaddafi's forces were documented using ambulances in their attacks. Injured
demonstrators were sometimes denied access to hospitals and ambulance
transport. The government also banned giving blood transfusions to people who
had taken part in the demonstrations. Security forces, including members of
Gaddafi's Revolutionary Committees, stormed hospitals and removed the dead.
Injured protesters were either summarily executed or had their oxygen masks, IV
drips, and wires connected to the monitors removed. The dead and injured were
piled into vehicles and taken away, possibly for cremation. Doctors were
prevented from documenting the numbers of dead and wounded, but an orderly in a
Tripoli hospital morgue estimated to the BBC that 600‚Äì700 protesters were
killed in Green Square in Tripoli on 20 February. The orderly claimed that
ambulances brought in three or four corpses at a time, and that after the ice
lockers were filled to capacity, bodies were placed on stretchers or the floor,
and that "it was in the same at the other hospitals". In the eastern city of
Bayda, anti-government forces hung two policemen who were involved in trying to
disperse demonstrations. In downtown Benghazi, anti-government forces killed
the managing director of al-Galaa hospital. The victim's body showed signs of
torture. On 19 February, several days after the conflict began, Saif al-Islam
Gaddafi announced the creation of a commission of inquiry into the violence,
chaired by a Libyan judge, as reported on state television. He stated that the
commission was intended to be "for members of Libyan and foreign organizations
of human rights" and that it will "investigate the circumstances and events
that have caused many victims." Later in the month, he went on state television
to deny allegations that the government had launched airstrikes against Libyan
cities and stated that the number of protesters killed had been exaggerated.
Towards the end of February, it was reported that the Gaddafi government had
suppressed protests in Tripoli by distributing automobiles, money and weapons
for hired followers to drive around Tripoli and attack people showing signs of
dissent. In Tripoli, "death squads" of mercenaries and Revolutionary Committees
members reportedly patrolled the streets and shot people who tried to take the
dead off the streets or gather in groups. The International Federation for
Human Rights concluded on 24 February that Gaddafi was implementing a scorched
earth strategy. The organization stated that "It is reasonable to fear that he
has, in fact, decided to largely eliminate, wherever he still can, Libyan
citizens who stood up against his regime and furthermore, to systematically and
indiscriminately repress civilians. These acts can be characterized as crimes
against humanity, as defined in Article 7 of the Rome Statute of the
International Criminal Court." In May 2011, International Criminal Court (ICC)
chief prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo estimated that 500‚Äì700 people were killed
by security forces in February 2011, before the rebels took up arms. According
to Moreno-Ocampo, "shooting at protesters was systematic". During the siege of
Misrata in May 2011, Amnesty International reported "horrifying" tactics such
as "indiscriminate attacks that have led to massive civilian casualties,
including use of heavy artillery, rockets and cluster bombs in civilian areas
and sniper fire against residents." Gaddafi's military commanders also
reportedly executed soldiers who refused to fire on protesters. The
International Federation for Human Rights reported a case where 130 soldiers
were executed. Some of the soldiers executed by their commanders were
reportedly burned alive. In June 2011, a more detailed investigation carried
out by Amnesty International found that many of the allegations against Gaddafi
and the Libyan state turned out to either be false or lack any credible
evidence, noting that rebels at times appeared to have knowingly made false
claims or manufactured evidence. In July 2011, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi had an
interview with Russia Today in which he denied the ICC's allegations that he or
his father Muammar Gaddafi ordered the killing of civilian protesters. He
claimed that he was not a member of the government or the military and
therefore had no authority to give such orders. He also claimed his father made
recorded calls to General Abdul Fatah Younis, who later defected to the rebel
forces, in order to request not to use force against protesters, to which he
said Fatah Younis responded that protesters were attacking a military site and
soldiers were acting in self-defense. Prison sites and torture. Gaddafi
reportedly imprisoned thousands or tens of thousands residents in Tripoli, with
Red Cross denied access to these hidden prisons. One of the most notorious is a
prison which was set up in a tobacco factory in Tripoli where inmates are
reported to have been fed just half a loaf of bread and a bottle of water a
day. In late April, United States Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice
alleged that soldiers loyal to Gaddafi were given Viagra and encouraged to
commit rapes in rebel-held or disputed areas. The allegations surfaced in an
"Al Jazeera" report the previous month from Libya-based doctors, who claimed to
have found Viagra in the pockets of government soldiers. Human rights groups
and aid workers had previously documented rapes by loyalist fighters during the
war. The British aid agency "Save the children" said it got reports that
children were raped by unknown perpetrators, although the charity warns that
these reports could not be confirmed. In Misrata, a rebel spokesman claimed
that government soldiers had committed a string of sexual assaults in Benghazi
Street before being pushed out by rebels. A doctor claimed that two young
sisters were raped by five Black African mercenaries after their brothers
joined the rebels. According to aid workers, four young girls were abducted and
held for four days, and were possibly sexually assaulted. In a questionnaire
259 refugee women reported that they had been raped by Gaddafi's soldiers,
however the accounts of these women could not be independently verified as the
psychologist who conducted the questionnaire claimed that "she had lost contact
with them". The validity of the rape allegations is questioned by Amnesty
International, which has not found evidence to back up the claims and notes
that there are indications that on several occasions the rebels in Benghazi
appeared to have knowingly made false claims or manufactured evidence.
Mercenaries. The Libyan government alleged that the armed rebellion was
composed of "criminal gangs and mercenaries." A Libyan official reported to
Libyan television that security forces arrested Tunisians and Egyptians that
were "trained to sow chaos." According to the Libyan Government authorities,
mercenaries from Turkey, Egypt, and Tunisia allegedly entered Libya to fight on
the side of the rebels. Dozens of them were arrested. Libya's Jamahiriya News
Agency reported that the detained men were part of a ‚Äúforeign network (and
were) trained to damage Libya‚Äôs stability, the safety of its citizens and
national unity.‚Äù Military advisors from Qatar participated on the side of the
rebels, and were sometimes labelled as "mercenaries" by the media. After
clashes between Government and anti-government forces, allegations arose of the
Libyan Gaddafi using foreign mercenaries. The Libyan Government's ambassador to
India Ali al-Essawi claimed that the defections of military units had indeed
led to such a decision. Video footage purporting to show this started to leak
out of the country. Gaddafi's former Chief of Protocol Nouri Al Misrahi claimed
in an interview with the "Al Jazeera" that Nigerien, Malian, Chadian and Kenyan
mercenaries are among foreign soldiers helping fight the uprising on behalf of
Gaddafi. Chadian sources repudiated allegations that mercenaries from Chad were
involved in the fighting in Libya. The Chadian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a
statement said that "Chadians are not sent or recruited in Chad to serve as
mercenaries in Libya," and that allegations about Chadian mercenaries were
"likely to cause serious physical and material harm to Chadians residing in
Libya." According to African Union chairman Jean Ping, the "NTC seems to
confuse black people with mercenaries,". Ping said that for the rebels, "All
blacks are mercenaries. If you do that, it means (that the) one-third of the
population of Libya, which is black, is also mercenaries. They are killing
people, normal workers, mistreating them." In Mali, members of the Tuareg tribe
confirmed that a large number of men, about 5,000, from the tribe went to Libya
in late February. Locals in Mali said they were promised ‚Ç¨7,500 ($10,000)
upfront payment and compensation up to ‚Ç¨750 ($1,000) per day. Gaddafi has
used Malian Tuaregs in his political projects before, sending them to fight in
places like Chad, Sudan and Lebanon and recently they have fought against Niger
government, a war which Gaddafi has reportedly sponsored. Malian government
officials told BBC that it's hard to stop the flow of fighters from Mali to
Libya. A recruitment center for Malian soldiers leaving to Libya was found in a
Bamako hotel. Reports from Ghana state that the men who went to Libya were
offered as much as ‚Ç¨1950 ($2,500) per day. Advertisements seeking mercenaries
were seen in Nigeria with at least one female Nigerian pro-Gaddafi sniper being
caught in late August outside of Tripoli. One group of mercenaries from Niger,
who had been allegedly recruited from the streets with promises of money,
included a soldier of just 13 years of age. "The Daily Telegraph" studied the
case of a sixteen-year-old captured Chadian child soldier in Bayda. The boy,
who had previously been a shepherd in Chad, told that a Libyan man had offered
him a job and a free flight to Tripoli, but in the end he had been airlifted to
shoot opposition members in Eastern Libya. Reports by EU experts stated that
Gaddafi's government hired between 300 and 500 European soldiers, including
some from EU countries, at high wages. According to Michel Koutouzis, who does
research on security issues for the EU institutions, the UN and the French
government, "In Libyan society, there is a taboo against killing people from
your own tribal group. This is one reason why Gaddafi needs foreign fighters,"
The Serbian newspaper "Alo!" stated that Serbs were hired to help Gaddafi in
the early days of the conflict. Rumors of Serbian pilots participating on the
side of Gaddafi appeared early in the conflict. Time magazine interviewed
mercenaries from ex-Yugoslavia who fled Gaddafi's forces in August. A witness
claimed that mercenaries were more willing to kill demonstrators than Libyan
forces were, and earned a reputation as among the most brutal forces employed
by the government. A doctor in Benghazi said of the mercenaries that "they know
one thing: to kill whose in front of them. Nothing else. They're killing people
in cold blood". On 7 April, Reuters reported that soldiers loyal to Gaddafi
were sent into refugee camps to intimidate and bribe black African migrant
workers into fighting for the Libyan state during the war. Some of these
"mercenaries" were compelled to fight against their wishes, according to a
source inside one of the refugee camps. In June 2011, Amnesty International
said it found no evidence of foreign mercenaries being used, saying the black
Africans claimed to be "mercenaries" were in fact "sub-Saharan migrants working
in Libya," and described the use of mercenaries as a "myth" that "inflamed
public opinion" and led to lynchings and executions of black Africans by rebel
forces. In October 2011 it was reported that the South African government was
investigating the possibility that South African mercenaries were hired by
Gaddafi to help him in his failed attempt to escape the besieged city of Sirte.
It is thought that two South African mercenaries died in that operation from a
NATO air strike on Gaddafi's convoy. One of the alleged mercenaries speaking
from a hospital in North Africa stated that around 19 South Africans had been
contracted by different companies for the operation. Censorship of events. A
subsidiary of Bull, developed a software called Eagle that enabled to monitor
internet traffic and which was implemented in Libya in 2008 and with better
performance in 2010. Gaddafi shut down all Internet communications in Libya,
and arrested Libyans who had given phone interviews to the media. International
journalists were banned by the Libyan authorities from reporting from Libya
except by invitation of the Gaddafi government. On 21 February, "The New York
Times" reported that Gaddafi had tried to impose a blackout on information from
Libya. Several residents reported that cellphone service was down, and even
landline phone service was sporadic. However, every day new footage made with
cell phone cameras finds its way to YouTube and the international media.
Journalists and human rights researchers make daily phone calls to hundreds of
civilians in government held territory. The rebels abducted five journalists
from Russia in April 2011 in Ajdabiya. They took away the journalists'
documents and equipment. In the city of Misrata, rebel leaders imposed
restrictions on the foreign media. Journalists were prevented from traveling to
the village of Dafniya and were turned back at rebel-held checkpoints.
Journalists were only able to use officially approved translators.
International journalists who have attempted to cover the events were attacked
by Gaddafi's forces. A "BBC News" crew was beaten and then lined up against a
wall by Gaddafi's soldiers, who then shot next to a journalist's ear and
laughed at them. A journalist working for "The Guardian" and another Brazilian
journalist have been detained. An "Al-Jazeera" journalist Ali Hassan al-Jaber
was murdered, and was apparently deliberately targeted. Gaddafi's soldiers held
four "New York Times" journalists ‚Äì Lynsey Addario, Anthony Shadid, Stephen
Farrell and Tyler Hicks ‚Äì in captivity for a week. Libyan citizen journalist
Mohammed Nabbous was shot in the head by Gaddafi's soldiers soon after exposing
the Gaddafi government's false reports related to the cease-fire declaration.
International media. After the uprising began, Libyan students studying in the
United States received phone calls from the Libyan embassy, instructing them to
participate in pro-Gaddafi rallies. They were threatened with losing their
government-funded scholarships if they refused. Gaddafi's ambassador denied the
reports. A campaign in Serbia has organized people to spread pro-Gaddafi
messages on the Internet. Gaddafi's men organized tours for foreign journalists
in Tripoli. "The Economist" correspondent in Tripoli noted "The picture
presented by the regime often falls apart, fast. Coffins at funerals have
sometimes turned out to be empty. Bombing sites are recycled. An injured seven-
year-old in a hospital was the victim of a car crash, according to a note
passed on surreptitiously by a nurse. Journalists who point out such blatant
massaging of facts are harangued in the hotel corridors." "The Guardian"
described journalism in Gaddafi's Libya as "North Korea with palm trees".
Journalist were not allowed to go anywhere, or talk to anyone, without
authorization from Gaddafi's officials who always followed them. Journalists
who didn't report events the way Gaddafi's officials instructed faced problems
and sudden deportations. In June 2011, Amnesty International criticized
"Western media coverage" which "has from the outset presented a very one-sided
view of the logic of events, portraying the protest movement as entirely
peaceful and repeatedly suggesting that the regime's security forces were
unaccountably massacring unarmed demonstrators who presented no security
challenge." Human shields. Gaddafi forces reportedly surrounded themselves with
civilians to protect themselves and key military sites like the Bab al-Azizia
compound in Tripoli from air strikes. Amnesty International cited claims that
Gaddafi had placed his tanks next to civilian facilities, using them as
shields. According to Libyan state television, the rebels used human shields in
Misrata. The Jamahiriya News Agency reported on a speech delivered by Leader
Gaddafi to Misrata Tribes in Tripol, in which he claimed that the rebels "used
children and women as human shields. They took more than 100 children whose
whereabouts we do not know‚Äîmaybe to Europe to be evangelised." Domestic
responses. Resignation of government officials. In response to the use of force
against protesters, a number of senior Libyan public officials either renounced
the Gaddafi government or resigned from their positions. Justice Minister
Mustafa Abdul Jalil and Interior Minister Major General Abdul Fatah Younis both
defected to the opposition. Oil Minister Shukri Ghanem and Foreign Minister
Moussa Koussa fled Libya, with the latter defecting to the UK. Libyan
Prosecutor General Abdul-Rahman al-Abbar resigned his position and joined the
opposition. The staff of a number of diplomatic missions of Libya have either
resigned or condemned the actions of the Gaddafi government. The ambassadors to
the Arab League, European Union and United Nations have either resigned or
stated that they no longer support the government. The ambassadors to
Australia, Bangladesh, Belgium, France, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nigeria,
Portugal, Sweden, and the US also renounced the Gaddafi government or formally
resigned. Military defections. A number of senior military officials defected
to the opposition, including General Abdul Fatah Younis, General al-Barani
Ashkal, Major General Suleiman Mahmoud, Brigadier General Musa'ed Ghaidan Al
Mansouri, Brigadier General Hassan Ibrahim Al Qarawi and Brigadier General
Dawood Issa Al Qafsi. Two Libyan Air Force colonels each flew their Mirage F1
fighter jets to Malta and requested asylum, after being ordered to carry out
airstrikes against civilian protesters in Benghazi. Colonel Nuretin Hurala, the
commander of the Benghazi Naval Base also defected along with senior naval
officials. Libyan royal family. Muhammad as-Senussi, son of the former Crown
Prince and grand-nephew of the late King Idris, sent his condolences "for the
heroes who have laid down their lives, killed by the brutal forces of Gaddafi"
and called on the international community "to halt all support for the dictator
with immediate effect." as-Senussi said that the protesters would be
"victorious in the end" and calls for international support to end the
violence. On 24 February, as-Senussi gave an interview to Al Jazeera where he
called upon the international community to help remove Gaddafi from power and
stop the ongoing "massacre". He dismissed talk of a civil war saying "The
Libyan people and the tribes have proven they are united". He later stated that
international community needs "less talk and more action" to stop the violence.
He asked for a no-fly zone over Libya but does not support foreign ground
troops. On 20 April, Mohammed spoke in front of the European Parliament calling
for more support for Libya. He also stated that he will support any form of
government that Libya will choose after Gaddafi including a constitutional
monarchy. A rival claimant to the throne, Idris bin Abdullah al-Senussi,
announced in an interview with "Adnkronos" that he was ready to return to Libya
and "assume leadership" once change had been initiated. On 21 February, he made
an appearance on "Piers Morgan Tonight" to discuss the uprising. In March, it
was reported Idris bin Abdullah had held meetings at the State Department and
Congress in Washington with US government officials. It was also reported
attempts at contact had been initiated by French and Saudi officials. On 3
March, it was reported that another member of the family, Prince Zouber al-
Senussi, had fled Libya with his family and was seeking asylum in Totebo,
Sweden. Course of the war. [[File:Libyan war final.svg|thumb|250px|The course
of the war. Major campaigns. battles.]] First weeks. By 23 February, Gaddafi
was suffering from the resignations and defections of close allies, from the
loss of Benghazi, the fall of Tobruk, Misrata, Bayda, Zawiya, Zuwara, Sabratha,
Sorman, and mounting international isolation and pressure. By the end of
February, Gaddafi's government had lost control of a significant part of Libya,
including the major cities of Misrata and Benghazi, and the important harbors
at Ra's Lanuf and Brega. But in March, Gaddafi's forces pushed the rebels back
and eventually reached Benghazi and Misrata. Foreign military intervention. The
Royal Canadian Navy frigate HMCS "Charlottetown" was deployed to the
Mediterranean off the coast of Libya on 2 March 2011, but did not take
immediate action once arrived. Seventeen days later, a multi-state coalition
began a military intervention in Libya to implement United Nations Security
Council Resolution 1973, which was taken in response to events then occurring
during the conflict. That same day, military operations began, with US forces
and one British submarine firing cruise missiles, the French Air Force, United
States Air Force and British Royal Air Force undertaking sorties across Libya
and a naval blockade by the Royal Navy. From the beginning of the intervention,
the initial coalition of Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Italy, Norway,
Qatar, Spain, UK and US expanded to seventeen states, with newer states mostly
enforcing the no-fly zone and naval blockade or providing military logistical
assistance. The effort was initially largely led by the United States. NATO
took control of the arms embargo on 23 March, named Operation Unified
Protector. An attempt to unify the military command of the air campaign (whilst
keeping political and strategic control with a small group), first failed over
objections by the French, German, and Turkish governments. On 24 March, NATO
agreed to take control of the no-fly zone, while command of targeting ground
units remains with coalition forces. In June 2011, Muammar Gaddafi and his son
Saif al-Islam announced that they were willing to hold elections and that
Gaddafi would step aside if he lost. Saif al-Islam stated that the elections
could be held within three months and transparency would be guaranteed through
international observers. NATO and the rebels rejected the offer, and NATO soon
resumed their bombardment of Tripoli. In July 2011, Saif al-Islam condemned
NATO for bombing Libyan civilians, including his family members and their
children, under the false pretence that their homes were military bases. He
also stated that NATO offered to drop the ICC charges against him and his
father if they accept a secret deal, an offer they rejected. He thus criticized
the ICC as "a fake court" that is controlled by the NATO nations. 20 August
rebel offensive. Heads of the rebellion reported on 21 August that Gaddafi's
son, Saif al-Islam, was under arrest and that they had encircled the leader's
compound, suggesting that the war had reached its endgame with an imminent
rebel victory. By 22 August, rebel fighters had gained entrance into Tripoli
and occupied Green Square, which was promptly renamed Martyrs' Square in memory
of those who had died fighting in the civil war. Early on 23 August, Saif al-
Islam appeared at the Gaddafi-controlled Rixos Hotel in central Tripoli and
boasted his father was still in control. Later the same day, rebels blasted
open the Bab al-Azizia compound in Tripoli through its north gates and stormed
inside. Despite previous reports suggesting that Muammar Gaddafi may be inside,
no members of the Gaddafi family were found. Early the following day, 24
August, Gaddafi broadcast an address from a Tripoli local radio station in
which he said the withdrawal from Bab al-Azizia had been a "tactical" move.
"The New York Times" reported rebel leaders as saying they believed the only
areas still under Gaddafi's control, other than the immediate neighbourhood of
Bab al-Azizia, were al-Hadhba and Abu Salim, the latter including the Rixos
Hotel where a group of foreign journalists had been trapped for days. However,
the report noted the rebels lacked a unified command and that Gaddafi loyalists
and snipers remained at large in many areas of Tripoli. Local hospitals and
clinics, even in areas considered under rebel control, were reporting hundreds
of cases of gunshot wounds and the death toll was impossible to estimate. By
late afternoon the journalists trapped at the Rixos Hotel had been released
while heavy fighting continued in the Abu Salim region close to Bab al-Azizia
and elsewhere. The rebels were reported as estimating 400 people had been
killed and a further 2,000 injured in the battle thus far. After Tripoli and
NTC victory. Efforts to mop up pro-Gaddafi forces in northwestern Libya and
toward Sirte began even before the rebels fully consolidated control of
Tripoli. Rebels took the city of Ghadames near the borders of Tunisia and
Algeria on 29 August. Members of the Gaddafi family have taken flight to
Algeria. In September, the Gaddafi stronghold of Bani Walid was besieged by
rebels, who reported that Gaddafi's son Saif al-Islam was hiding in the city.
On 22 September, the NTC captured the southern city of Sabha, and claimed to
have found a large cache of chemical weapons. Concerns were raised over the
danger of Gaddafi mounting an insurgency against the new authorities. By mid-
October 2011, much of the city of Sirte had been taken by NTC forces, although
fierce fighting continued around the city center, where many pro-Gaddafi
fighters were encamped. The NTC captured the whole of Sirte on 20 October 2011,
and reported that Gaddafi himself had been killed in the city. Some civilian
Gaddafi supporters remaining in the city reported that women and children had
been killed in crossfire or fired upon by rebel forces. There were also reports
of harassment and theft by rebels, however the rebel army indicated it would
leave unarmed civilians "to their own devices", and had allowed families in the
city access to supplies and medical assistance. Aftermath. Despite the defeat
of Gaddafi's loyalists, capture of last loyalist cities and Gaddafi's death,
Saif al-Islam, Gaddafi's son and successor, remained hiding in the southern
region of Libya until his capture in mid-November. In addition, some loyalist
forces crossed into Niger, though the escape attempts exploded into violence,
when detected by Nigerien troops. Sporadic clashes between NTC and former
loyalists also continued across Libya with low intensity. On 23 November, seven
people were killed in clashes at Bani Walid, five of them among the
revolutionary forces and one Gaddafi loyalist. Fighting broke out on 3 January
2012, at a building used as intelligence headquarters by the Gaddafi
government. Abdul Jalil, the chairman of NTC, warned Libyans that the country
could descend into another civil war if they resort to force to settle their
differences. It was reported that five people were killed and at least five
injured in the events. Also on 3 January, Libya's government named a retired
general from Misrata, Yousel al-Manquosh, as head of the country's armed
forces. Bani Walid was captured by local tribal fighters on 23 January, due to
the NTC's perceived inability to cooperate with them. The local forces were
said to have used heavy weapons and numbered 100-150 men. Eight NTC fighters
were killed and at least 25 wounded, with the rest fleeing the city. Clashes
were also reported in Benghazi and Tripoli. The NTC has functioned as an
interim legislature during the transitional period. In early May 2012, it
passed its most sweeping measures to date, granting immunity to former rebel
fighters for acts committed during the civil war and ordering that all
detainees accused of fighting for Gaddafi should be tried or released by 12
July 2012. It also adopted Law 37, prohibiting the publication of "propaganda"
criticising the revolution, questioning the authority of Libya's governing
organs, or praising Muammar Gaddafi, his family, his government, or the ideas
of the "Green Book". Impact. Humanitarian situation. By the end of February
2011, supplies of medicine, fuel and food were dangerously low in Libya's urban
centres. On 25 February, the International Committee of the Red Cross launched
an emergency appeal for to meet the emergency needs of people affected by the
violent unrest in Libya. In early March, the fighting across Libya meant that
more than a million people fleeing or inside the country needed humanitarian
aid. The Islamic Relief and the WFP also coordinated a shipment of humanitarian
supplies to Misrata. In March, the Swedish government donated medical supplies
and other humanitarian aid and the UN World Food Programme provided food.
Turkey sent a hospital ship to Misrata and a Turkish cargo ship brought 141
tons of humanitarian aid. Another humanitarian issue was refugees fleeing the
crisis. A humanitarian ship docked in harbour of Misrata in April to begin the
evacuation of stranded migrants. By 10 July, over 150,000 migrants were
evacutated. Migrants were also stranded elsewhere in Libya, such as in the
southern towns of Sebha and Gatroum. Fleeing the violence of Tripoli by road,
as many as 4,000 refugees were crossing the Libya‚ÄìTunisia border daily during
the first days of the uprising. Among those escaping the violence were native
Libyans as well as foreign nationals including Egyptians, Tunisians and Turks.
Potential military‚Äìhumanitarian coordination. While the UN sanctioned
military intervention has been implemented on humanitarian grounds, UN agencies
seeking to ease the humanitarian crisis repeatedly rejected offers of support
from the military to carry out the agencies' humanitarian operations. The
conditions under which such support may be accepted are outlined in the
Guidelines on the Use of Military and Civil Defence Assets to Support United
Nations Humanitarian Activities in Complex Emergencies (MCDA), whereby military
support can be used but only temporarily and as a last resort. Yet, there
remains the concern that aid agencies' neutrality will be brought into question
by accepting military support, putting aid staff at risk of being attacked and
causing some parties to prevent the agencies accessing all the areas they need
to. Furthermore, the military may not always have the technical skills required
to assess the need for aid and to ensure its effective distribution. Despite
this, offers continue for the creation of an aid corridor and aid agencies have
accepted military logistical support in the past, for instance in the 2010
Pakistan floods response. Ethnic targeting. In August 2011, the UNHCR issued a
strong call for the rights and lives of sub-Saharan Africans living in Libya to
be protected due to reports that black Africans were being targeted by the
rebel forces as cities fell. Other news sources including "The Independent" and
CNN have reported on the targeting of black people in rebel held areas. An
Amnesty International statement, released on 30 August 2011, stated that on
visits to detention centres in Zawiya and Tripoli, Amnesty International was
informed that between one third and half of those detained were from Sub-
Saharan Africa. A New York Times online article also comments that "it seems
that plenty of the black Africans captured as mercenaries were never actually
involved in the fight". "Hundreds of thousands of sub-Saharan Africans worked
in Gaddafi's Libya, doing everything from managing hotels to sweeping floors.
But some also fought as pro-Gaddafi mercenaries, and many migrant workers [-
] fled ahead of the rebels, fearing they would be mistaken for mercenaries." It
was also reported that some African women have claimed rebels are raping them
in refugee camps, with additional reports of forced labour. Foreign aid workers
are also claiming to be prohibited from officially talking about the
allegations. The town of Tawergha, which supported Gaddafi prior to its capture
by anti-Gaddafi fighters in August, has been emptied of its mostly black
inhabitants in what appeared to be a "major reprisal against supporters of the
Gaddafi regime", according to an 11 September report from "The Sunday
Telegraph", and commanders of the Misrata Brigade are refusing to allow the
displaced townspeople to return. One commander was quoted as saying, "Tawergha
no longer exists." Libyan refugees. Fleeing the violence of Tripoli by road, as
many as 4,000 refugees were crossing the Libya‚ÄìTunisia border daily during
the first days of the uprising. Among those, escaping the violence, were native
Libyans as well as foreign nationals including Egyptians, Tunisians and Turks.
In February, Italian Foreign Minister Frattini expressed his concerns that the
amount of Libyan refugees trying to reach Italy might reach between 200,000 and
300,000 people. By 1 March, officials from the UN High Commissioner for
Refugees had confirmed allegations of discrimination against sub-Saharan
Africans who were held in dangerous conditions in the no-man's-land between
Tunisia and Libya. By 3 March, an estimated 200,000 refugees had fled Libya to
either Tunisia or Egypt. A provisional refugee camp set up at Ras Ajdir with a
capacity for 10,000 was overflowing with an estimated 20,000 to 30,000
refugees. Many tens of thousands were still trapped on the Libyan side of the
frontier. By 3 March, the situation was described as a logistical nightmare,
with the World Health Organization warning of the risk of epidemics. To
continue responding to the needs of people staying at the Ras Ajdir crossing
point in Tunisia, the WFP and Secours Islamique-France were upgrading a kitchen
that would provide breakfast for families. Separately, the ICRC advised it was
handing over its operations at the Choucha Camp to the Tunisian Red Crescent.
Since 24 March, the WFP supplied over 42,500 cooked meals for TCNs at the
Saloum border. A total of 1,650 cartons of fortified date bars (equivalent of
13.2 metric tons) had also been provided to supplement these meals. "The Sunday
Telegraph" reported on 11 September that almost the entire population of
Tawergha, a town of about 10,000 people, had been forced to flee their homes by
anti-Gaddafi fighters after their takeover of the settlement. The report
suggested that Tawergha, which was dominated by black Libyans, may have been
the subject of ethnic cleansing provoked by a combination of racism and
bitterness on the part of Misratan fighters over the town's support for Gaddafi
during the siege of Misrata. Economic, religious and tribal. Oil prices around
the world increased during the Libyan conflict, due to the country's
significant oil reserves. The Arabian Gulf Oil Company, the second-largest
state-owned oil company in Libya, announced plans to use oil funds to support
anti-Gaddafi forces. Islamic leaders and clerics in Libya, notably the Network
of Free Ulema ‚Äì Libya urged all Muslims to rebel against Gaddafi. The Tuareg
and Magarha tribes announced their support of the protesters. The Zuwayya
tribe, based in eastern Libya, threatened to cut off oil exports from fields in
its part of Libya if Libyan security forces continued attacking demonstrators.
Casualties. Independent numbers of dead and injured in the conflict have still
not been made available. Estimates have been widely varied. On 24 February,
Libya's ambassador to Malta said that Gaddafi's government believed the number
of dead to be about 300, including civilians, police officers, and soldiers.
The exact same day, the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting reported that the
International Criminal Court estimated 10,000 had been killed. The numbers of
injured were estimated to be around 4,000 by 22 February. On 2 March, the World
Health Organization estimated approximately 2,000 killed. At the same time, the
opposition claimed that 6,500 people had died. Later, rebel spokesman Abdul
Hafiz Ghoga reported that the death toll reached 8,000. In June 2011, Amnesty
International stated that earlier estimates of the initial clashes in February
were exaggerated. It estimated that during the first few days of the conflict,
100 to 110 people were killed in Benghazi and 59 to 64 were killed in Bayda. On
8 September, Naji Barakat, the Health Minister of the National Transitional
Council, stated that about half of an estimated 30,000 dead were believed to
have been pro-Gaddafi fighters. War wounded were estimated as at least 50,000,
of which about 20,000 were serious injuries, but this estimate was expected to
rise. However, there was no independent verification of the Health Minister's
claim and, one month later, the NTC reduced the estimated number of killed to
25,000. International reactions. Many states and supranational bodies condemned
Gaddafi's government over disputed allegations of air attacks on civilian
targets within the country. Virtually all Western countries cut off diplomatic
relations with Gaddafi's government over disputed reports of an aerial bombing
campaign in February and March, and a number of other countries led by Peru and
Botswana did likewise. United Nations Security Council Resolution 1970 was
adopted on 26 February, freezing the assets of Gaddafi and ten members of his
inner circle and restricting their travel. The resolution also referred the
actions of the government to the International Criminal Court for
investigation, and an arrest warrant for Gaddafi was issued on 27 June. This
was followed by an arrest warrant issued by Interpol on 8 September. The
disputed allegations about the Libyan government's use of the Libyan Air Force
to strike civilians led to the adoption of United Nations Security Council
Resolution 1973 to create a Libyan no-fly zone on 17 March, though several
countries involved in the resolution's enforcement have also carried out
regular strike missions to degrade the offensive capacity of the Libyan Army
and destroy the government's command and control capabilities, effectively
acting in "de facto" support of anti-Gaddafi forces on the ground. 100
countries have recognized the anti-Gaddafi National Transitional Council as
Libya's legitimate representative, with many of those countries explicitly
describing it as the legal interim government of the country due to the
perceived loss of legitimacy on the part of Gaddafi's government. Many states
have also either issued travel advisories or attempted evacuations. Some
evacuations were successful in either going to Malta or via land borders to
Egypt or Tunisia; other attempts were hindered by tarmac damage at Benghazi's
airport or refusals of permission to land in Tripoli. There were also several
solidarity protests in other countries that were mostly composed of Libyan
expatriates. Financial markets around the world had adverse reactions to the
instability with oil prices rising to a two-and-a-half year high.
