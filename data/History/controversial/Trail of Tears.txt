Trail of Tears The Trail of Tears is a name given to the forced relocation and
movement of Native American nations from southeastern parts of the United
States following the Indian Removal Act of 1830. The removal included many
members of the Cherokee, Muscogee (Creek), Seminole, Chickasaw, and Choctaw
nations, among others in the United States, from their homelands to Indian
Territory (eastern sections of the present-day state of Oklahoma). The phrase
originated from a description of the removal of the Choctaw Nation in 1831.
Many Native Americans suffered from exposure, disease and starvation en route
to their destinations. Many died, including 4,000 of the 15,000 relocated
Cherokee. In 1831, the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Muscogee-Creek, and
Seminole (sometimes collectively referred to as the Five Civilized Tribes) were
living as autonomous nations in what would be called the American Deep South.
The process of cultural transformation (proposed by George Washington and Henry
Knox) was gaining momentum, especially among the Cherokee and Choctaw. Andrew
Jackson continued and renewed the political and military effort for the removal
of the Native Americans from these lands with the passage of the Indian Removal
Act of 1830. In 1831 the Choctaw were the first to be removed, and they became
the model for all other removals. After the Choctaw, the Seminole were removed
in 1832, the Creek in 1834, then the Chickasaw in 1837, and finally the
Cherokee in 1838. After removal, some Native Americans remained in their
ancient homelands - the Choctaw are found in Mississippi, the Seminole in
Florida, the Creek in Alabama, and the Cherokee in North Carolina. A limited
number of non-native Americans (including African-Americans - usually as
slaves) also accompanied the Native American nations on the trek westward. By
1837, 46,000 Native Americans from these southeastern states had been removed
from their homelands thereby opening for predominantly white settlement. The
fixed boundaries of these autonomous tribal nations, comprising large areas of
the United States, were subject to continual cession and annexation prior to
1830, in part due to pressure from squatters and the threat of military force
in the newly declared U.S. territories -- federally administered regions whose
boundaries supervened upon the Native treaty claims. As these territories
became U.S. states, state governments sought to dissolve the boundaries of the
Indian nations within their borders, which were independent of state
jurisdiction, and to expropriate the land therein. These pressures were
magnified by U.S. population growth and the expansion of slavery in the South.
Legal background. The territorial boundaries claimed as sovereign and
controlled by the Native American nations living in what was then known as the
Indian Territories—the portion of the early United States east of the
Mississippi River not yet claimed or allotted to become Oklahoma -- were fixed
and determined by national treaties with the United States Federal government
under terms recognizing these entities as dependent but internally sovereign,
or autonomous nations under the sole jurisdiction of the Federal government.
While retaining their tribal governance, which included a constitution or
official council in tribes such as the Iroquois and Cherokee, many portions of
the southeastern Native American nations had become partially or completely
economically integrated into the economy of the region. This included the
plantation economy in states such as Georgia, and the possession of slaves.
These slaves were also forcibly relocated during the process of removal. A
similar process had occurred earlier in the territories controlled by the
Confederacy of the Six Nations in what is now upstate New York prior to the
British invasion and subsequent U.S. annexation of the Iroquois nation. Under
the history of U.S. treaty law, the territorial boundaries claimed by Federally
recognized tribes received the same status under which the Southeastern tribal
claims were recognized; until the following establishment of reservations of
land, determined by the Federal government, which were ceded to the remaining
tribes by "de jure" treaty, in a process that often entailed forced relocation.
The establishment of the Indian Territory and the dissolution of Indian
territories east of the Mississippi anticipated the establishment of the U.S.
Indian reservation system, which was subsequently imposed on remaining Indian
lands. The statutory argument for Native American sovereignty persisted until
the Supreme Court ruled in "Cherokee Nation v. Georgia" (1831), that ("e.g.")
the Cherokees were not a sovereign and independent nation, and therefore not
entitled to a hearing before the court. However, in "Worcester v. Georgia"
(1832), the court re-established limited internal sovereignty under the sole
jurisdiction of the Federal government, in a ruling that both opposed the
subsequent forced relocation and set the basis for modern U.S. case law. While
the latter ruling was famously defied by Jackson, the actions of the Jackson
administration were not isolated because state and federal officials had
violated treaties without consequence, often attributed to military exigency,
as the members of individual Native American nations were not automatically
United States citizens and were rarely given standing in any U.S. court.
Compounding this was the fact that while citizenship tests existed for Native
Americans living in newly annexed areas before and after forced relocation,
individual U.S. states did not recognize tribal land claims, only individual
title under State law, and distinguished between the rights of white and non-
white citizens, who often had limited standing in court; and Indian removal was
carried out under U.S. military jurisdiction, often by state militias. As a
result, individual Native Americans who could prove U.S. citizenship were
nevertheless displaced from newly annexed areas. The military actions and
subsequent treaties enacted by the Jackson and Van Buren administrations
pursuant to the 1830 law are widely considered to have directly caused the
expulsion or death of a substantial part of the Native Americans then living in
the southeastern United States. Choctaw voluntary removal. [[File:George-W-
Harkins.jpg|upright|left|thumb|In 1832 a young 22-year-old Harkins wrote the
Secretary of War Lewis Cass appointed George Gaines to manage the removals.
Gaines decided to remove Choctaws in three phases starting in 1831 and ending
in 1833. The first was to begin on November 1, 1831 with groups meeting at
Memphis and Vicksburg. A harsh winter would batter the emigrants with flash
floods, sleet, and snow. Initially the Choctaws were to be transported by wagon
but floods halted them. With food running out, the residents of Vicksburg and
Memphis were concerned. Five steamboats (the Walter Scott, the Brandywine, the
Reindeer, the Talma, and the Cleopatra) would ferry Choctaws to their river-
based destinations. The Memphis group traveled up the Arkansas for about to
Arkansas Post. There the temperature stayed below freezing for almost a week
with the rivers clogged with ice, so there would be no travel for weeks. Food
rationing consisted of a handful of boiled corn, one turnip, and two cups of
heated water per day. Forty government wagons were sent to Arkansas Post to
transport them to Little Rock. When they reached Little Rock, a Choctaw chief
(thought to be Thomas Harkins or Nitikechi) quoted to the Arkansas Gazette that
the removal was a ""trail of tears and death"." The Vicksburg group was led by
an incompetent guide and was lost in the Lake Providence swamps. Alexis de
Tocqueville, the French philosopher, witnessed the Choctaw removals while in
Memphis, Tennessee in 1831, Nearly 17,000 Choctaws made the move to what would
be called Indian Territory and then later Oklahoma. About 2,500–6,000 died
along the trail of tears. Approximately 5,000–6,000 Choctaws remained in
Mississippi in 1831 after the initial removal efforts. The Choctaws who chose
to remain in newly formed Mississippi were subject to legal conflict,
harassment, and intimidation. The Choctaws "have had our habitations torn down
and burned, our fences destroyed, cattle turned into our fields and we
ourselves have been scourged, manacled, fettered and otherwise personally
abused, until by such treatment some of our best men have died." The Choctaws
in Mississippi were later reformed as the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians
and the removed Choctaws became the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma. Seminole
resistance. The U.S. acquired Florida from Spain via the Adams-Onís Treaty and
took possession in 1821. In 1832 the Seminoles were called to a meeting at
Payne's Landing on the Ocklawaha River. The treaty negotiated called for the
Seminoles to move west, if the land were found to be suitable. They were to be
settled on the Creek reservation and become part of the Creek tribe, who
considered them deserters; some of the Seminoles had been derived from Creek
bands but also from other tribes. Those among the tribe who once were members
of Creek bands did not wish to move west to where they were certain that they
would meet death for leaving the main band of Creek Indians. The delegation of
seven chiefs who were to inspect the new reservation did not leave Florida
until October 1832. After touring the area for several months and conferring
with the Creeks who had already settled there, the seven chiefs signed a
statement on March 28, 1833 that the new land was acceptable. Upon their return
to Florida, however, most of the chiefs renounced the statement, claiming that
they had not signed it, or that they had been forced to sign it, and in any
case, that they did not have the power to decide for all the tribes and bands
that resided on the reservation. The villages in the area of the Apalachicola
River were more easily persuaded, however, and went west in 1834. On December
28, 1835 a group of Seminoles and blacks ambushed a U.S. Army company marching
from Fort Brooke in Tampa to Fort King in Ocala. Out of 110 army troops, only
three survived. This came to be known as the Dade Massacre. As the realization
that the Seminoles would resist relocation sank in, Florida began preparing for
war. The St. Augustine Militia asked the War Department for the loan of 500
muskets. Five hundred volunteers were mobilized under Brig. Gen. Richard K.
Call. Indian war parties raided farms and settlements, and families fled to
forts, large towns, or out of the territory altogether. A war party led by
Osceola captured a Florida militia supply train, killing eight of its guards
and wounding six others. Most of the goods taken were recovered by the militia
in another fight a few days later. Sugar plantations along the Atlantic coast
south of St. Augustine were destroyed, with many of the slaves on the
plantations joining the Seminoles. Other warchiefs such as Halleck Tustenuggee,
Jumper, and Black Seminoles Abraham and John Horse continued the Seminole
resistance against the army. The war ended, after a full decade of fighting, in
1842. The U.S. government is estimated to have spent about $20,000,000 on the
war, at the time an astronomical sum, and equal to $ today. Many Indians were
forcibly exiled to Creek lands west of the Mississippi; others retreated into
the Everglades. In the end, the government gave up trying to subjugate the
Seminole in their Everglades redoubts and left fewer than 100 Seminoles in
peace. However, other scholars state that at least several hundred Seminoles
remained in the Everglades after the Seminole Wars. As a result of the Seminole
Wars, the surviving Seminole band of the Everglades claims to be the only
Federally recognized tribe which never relinquished sovereignty or signed a
peace treaty with the United States. Creek dissolution. After the War of 1812,
some Muscogee leaders such as William McIntosh signed treaties that ceded more
land to Georgia. The 1814 signing of the Treaty of Fort Jackson signaled the
end for the Creek Nation and for all Indians in the South. Friendly Creek
leaders, like Selocta and Big Warrior, addressed Sharp Knife (the Indian
nickname for Andrew Jackson) and reminded him that they keep the peace.
Nevertheless, Jackson retorted that they did not "cut (Tecumseh's) throat" when
they had the chance, so they must now cede Creek lands. Jackson also ignored
Article 9 of the Treaty of Ghent that restored sovereignty to Indians and their
nations. "Jackson opened this first peace session by faintly acknowledging the
help of the friendly Creeks. That done, he turned to the Red Sticks and
admonished them for listening to evil counsel. For their crime, he said, the
entire Creek Nation must pay. He demanded the equivalent of all expenses
incurred by the United States in prosecuting the war, which by his calculation
came to of land." - Robert V. Remini, "Andrew Jackson" Eventually, the Creek
Confederacy enacted a law that made further land cessions a capital offense.
Nevertheless, on February 12, 1825, McIntosh and other chiefs signed the Treaty
of Indian Springs, which gave up most of the remaining Creek lands in Georgia.
After the U.S. Senate ratified the treaty, McIntosh was assassinated on May 13,
1825, by Creeks led by Menawa. The Creek National Council, led by Opothle
Yohola, protested to the United States that the Treaty of Indian Springs was
fraudulent. President John Quincy Adams was sympathetic, and eventually the
treaty was nullified in a new agreement, the Treaty of Washington (1826).
Writes historian R. Douglas Hurt: "The Creeks had accomplished what no Indian
nation had ever done or would do again — achieve the annulment of a ratified
treaty." However, Governor Troup of Georgia ignored the new treaty and began to
forcibly remove the Indians under the terms of the earlier treaty. At first,
President Adams attempted to intervene with federal troops, but Troup called
out the militia, and Adams, fearful of a civil war, conceded. As he explained
to his intimates, "The Indians are not worth going to war over." Although the
Creeks had been forced from Georgia, with many Lower Creeks moving to the
Indian Territory, there were still about 20,000 Upper Creeks living in Alabama.
However, the state moved to abolish tribal governments and extend state laws
over the Creeks. Opothle Yohola appealed to the administration of President
Andrew Jackson for protection from Alabama; when none was forthcoming, the
Treaty of Cusseta was signed on March 24, 1832, which divided up Creek lands
into individual allotments. Creeks could either sell their allotments and
received funds to remove to the west, or stay in Alabama and submit to state
laws. Land speculators and squatters began to defraud Creeks out of their
allotments, and violence broke out, leading to the so-called "Creek War of
1836". Secretary of War Lewis Cass dispatched General Winfield Scott to end the
violence by forcibly removing the Creeks to the Indian Territory west of the
Mississippi River. Chickasaw monetary removal. Unlike other tribes who
exchanged land grants, the Chickasaw received financial compensation from the
United States for their lands east of the Mississippi River. In 1836, the
Chickasaws had reached an agreement to purchase land from the previously
removed Choctaws after a bitter five-year debate. They paid the Choctaws
$530,000 (equal to $ today) for the westernmost part of the Choctaw land. The
first group of Chickasaws moved in 1837 and was led by John M. Millard. The
Chickasaws gathered at Memphis on July 4, 1837, with all of their
assets—belongings, livestock, and slaves. Once across the Mississippi River,
they followed routes previously established by the Choctaws and the Creeks.
Once in Indian Territory, the Chickasaws merged with the Choctaw nation. After
several decades of mutual distrust, they regained nationhood. Cherokee forced
relocation. In 1838, the Cherokee people were forcibly removed from their lands
in the Southeastern United States to the Indian Territory (present day
Oklahoma) in the Western United States, which resulted in the deaths of
approximately 4,000 Cherokees. In the Cherokee language, the event is called
"Nu na da ul tsun yi"—“the Place Where They Cried”. The Cherokee Trail of
Tears resulted from the enforcement of the Treaty of New Echota, an agreement
signed under the provisions of the Indian Removal Act of 1830, which exchanged
Native American land in the East for lands west of the Mississippi River, but
which was never accepted by the elected tribal leadership or a majority of the
Cherokee people. Tensions between Georgia and the Cherokee Nation were brought
to a crisis by the discovery of gold near Dahlonega, Georgia, in 1829,
resulting in the Georgia Gold Rush, the first gold rush in U.S. history.
Hopeful gold speculators began trespassing on Cherokee lands, and pressure
began to mount on the Georgia government to fulfill the promises of the
"Compact of 1802". When Georgia moved to extend state laws over the Cherokee
lands in 1830, the matter went to the U.S. Supreme Court. In "Cherokee Nation
v. Georgia" (1831), the Marshall court ruled that the Cherokee Nation was not a
sovereign and independent nation, and therefore refused to hear the case.
However, in "Worcester v. Georgia" (1832), the Court ruled that Georgia could
not impose laws in Cherokee territory, since only the national government —
not state governments — had authority in Indian affairs. Jackson had no
desire to use the power of the national government to protect the Cherokees
from Georgia, since he was already entangled with states’ rights issues in
what became known as the nullification crisis. With the Indian Removal Act of
1830, the U.S. Congress had given Jackson authority to negotiate removal
treaties, exchanging Indian land in the East for land west of the Mississippi
River. Jackson used the dispute with Georgia to put pressure on the Cherokees
to sign a removal treaty. Nevertheless, the treaty, passed by Congress by a
single vote, and signed into law by President Andrew Jackson, was imposed by
his successor President Martin Van Buren who allowed Georgia, Tennessee, North
Carolina, and Alabama an armed force of 7,000 made up of militia, regular army,
and volunteers under General Winfield Scott to round up about 13,000 Cherokees
into concentration camps at the U.S. Indian Agency near Cleveland, Tennessee
before being sent to the West. Most of the deaths occurred from disease,
starvation and cold in these camps. Their homes were burned and their property
destroyed and plundered. Farms belonging to the Cherokees for generations were
won by white settlers in a lottery. After the initial roundup, the U.S.
military still oversaw the emigration until they met the forced destination.
Private John G. Burnett later wrote, "Future generations will read and condemn
the act and I do hope posterity will remember that private soldiers like
myself, and like the four Cherokees who were forced by General Scott to shoot
an Indian Chief and his children, had to execute the orders of our superiors.
We had no choice in the matter." In the winter of 1838 the Cherokee began the
thousand-mile march with scant clothing and most on foot without shoes or
moccasins. The march began in Red Clay, Tennessee, the location of the last
Eastern capital of the Cherokee Nation. The Cherokee were given used blankets
from a hospital in Tennessee where an epidemic of small pox had broken out.
Because of the diseases, the Indians were not allowed to go into any towns or
villages along the way; many times this meant traveling much farther to go
around them. After crossing Tennessee and Kentucky, they arrived in Southern
Illinois at Golconda about the 3rd of December 1838. Here the starving Indians
were charged a dollar a head (equal to $ today) to cross the river on "Berry's
Ferry" which typically charged twelve cents, equal to $ today. They were not
allowed passage until the ferry had serviced all others wishing to cross and
were forced to take shelter under "Mantle Rock," a shelter bluff on the
Kentucky side, until "Berry had nothing better to do". Many died huddled
together at Mantle Rock waiting to cross. Several Cherokee were murdered by
locals. The killers filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Government through the
courthouse in Vienna, suing the government for $35 a head (equal to $ today) to
bury the murdered Cherokee. "There is the coldest weather in Illinois I ever
experienced anywhere. The streams are all frozen over something like thick. We
are compelled to cut through the ice to get water for ourselves and animals. It
snows here every two or three days at the fartherest. We are now camped in
Mississippi swamp from the river, and there is no possible chance of crossing
the river for the numerous quantity of ice that comes floating down the river
every day. We have only traveled on the last month, including the time spent at
this place, which has been about three weeks. It is unknown when we shall cross
the river..." Removed Cherokees initially settled near Tahlequah, Oklahoma.
When signing the Treaty of New Echota in 1835 Major Ridge said "I have signed
my death warrant." The resulting political turmoil led to the killings of Major
Ridge, John Ridge, and Elias Boudinot; of the leaders of the Treaty Party, only
Stand Watie escaped death. The population of the Cherokee Nation eventually
rebounded, and today the Cherokees are the largest American Indian group in the
United States. There were some exceptions to removal. Perhaps 100 Cherokees
evaded the U.S. soldiers and lived off the land in Georgia and other states.
Those Cherokees who lived on private, individually owned lands (rather than
communally owned tribal land) were not subject to removal. In North Carolina,
about 400 Cherokees, known as the Oconaluftee Cherokee, lived on land in the
Great Smoky Mountains owned by a white man named William Holland Thomas (who
had been adopted by Cherokees as a boy), and were thus not subject to removal.
Added to this were some 200 Cherokee from the Nantahala area allowed to stay in
the Qualla Boundary after assisting the U.S. Army in hunting down and capturing
the family of the old prophet, "Tsali". (Tsali faced a firing squad.) These
North Carolina Cherokees became the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Nation. Trail
of Tears National Historic Trail. In 1987, about of trails were authorized by
Federal law to mark the removal of seventeen detachments of the Cherokee
people. Called the "Trail of Tears National Historic Trail," it traverses
portions of nine states and includes land and water routes. Terminology of
forced relocation. The latter forced relocations have sometimes been referred
to as a "death march", in particular with reference to the Cherokee march
across the Midwest in 1838, which occurred on a predominantly land route. It
was later described as an act of genocide by Alfred Cave in 2003. Tribesmen who
had means initially conducted their own removal. Contingents that were led by
conductors from the U.S. Army included those led by Edward Deas, who was
claimed to be a sympathizer for the Cherokee plight. The largest death toll
from the Cherokee forced relocation comes from the period after the May 23,
1838 deadline. This was at the point when the remaining Cherokee were rounded
into camps and pressed into oversized detachments, often over 700 in size
(larger than Little Rock or Memphis at that time). Communicable diseases spread
quickly through these closely quartered groups, killing many. These contingents
were among the last to move, but following the same routes the others had
taken; the areas they were going through had been depleted of supplies due to
the vast numbers that had gone before them. The marchers were subject to
extortion and violence along the route. In addition, these final contingents
were forced to set out during the hottest and coldest months of the year,
killing many. Exposure to the elements, disease and starvation, harassment by
local frontiersmen, and insufficient rations similarly killed up to one-third
of the Choctaw and other nations on the march. It has also been claimed by
descendants of the survivors that the term "Trail of Tears" referred to the
tears of those who "witnessed" the suffering of the marchers, and that the
Native Americans themselves marched in silence. There exists some debate among
historians and the affected tribes as to whether the term "Trail of Tears"
should be used to refer to the entire history of forced relocations from the
United States east of the Mississippi into Indian Territory (as was the stated
U.S. policy), or to the Five Tribes described above, to the route of the land
march specifically, or to specific marches in which the remaining holdouts from
each area were rounded up.
