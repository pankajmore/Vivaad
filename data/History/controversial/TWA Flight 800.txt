TWA Flight 800 Trans World Airlines Flight 800 (TWA 800), a Boeing 747-131,
exploded and crashed into the Atlantic Ocean near East Moriches, New York, on
July 17, 1996, at about 20:31 EDT, 12 minutes after takeoff from John F.
Kennedy International Airport, killing all 230 people on board. TWA 800 was the
second-deadliest U.S. aviation accident after American Airlines Flight 191
until American Airlines Flight 587, which also took off from JFK Airport two
months after the September 11 attacks. It remains the third-deadliest aviation
accident to occur in U.S. territory. TWA 800 was a scheduled international
passenger flight from New York to Rome, with a stopover in Paris. While
accident investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)
traveled to the scene, arriving the following morning, there was much initial
speculation that a terrorist attack was the cause of the crash. Consequently,
the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) initiated a parallel criminal
investigation. Sixteen months later the FBI announced that no evidence had been
found of a criminal act and closed its active investigation. The four-year NTSB
investigation concluded with the approval of the Aircraft Accident Report on
August 23, 2000, ending the most extensive, complex, and costly air disaster
investigation in United States history. The report's conclusion was that the
probable cause of the accident was an explosion of flammable fuel/air vapors in
a fuel tank, and, although it could not be determined with certainty, the most
likely cause of the explosion was a short circuit. As a result of the
investigation, new requirements were developed for aircraft to prevent future
fuel tank explosions. Many TWA Flight 800 alternative theories exist, the most
prevalent being that a missile strike from a terrorist or U.S. Navy vessel
caused the crash, and is the subject of a government coverup. Accident flight.
The accident airplane, registration N93119, was manufactured by Boeing in July
1971, and purchased new by TWA. The aircraft had completed 16,869 flights with
93,303 hours of operation. On the day of the accident the airplane departed
Athens, Greece, as TWA Flight 881, and arrived at the gate at John F. Kennedy
International Airport (JFK) about 16:38. The aircraft was refueled, and there
was a crew change; the new flight crew consisted of Captain Ralph G. Kevorkian,
Captain/Check Airman Steven E. Snyder and Flight Engineer/Check Airman Richard
G. Campbell (all with more than 30 years employment at TWA), and Flight
Engineer Trainee Oliver Krick, who was starting the sixth leg of his initial
operating experience training. Because of technical problems with the thrust
reverser sensors during the landing of TWA 881 at JFK, prior to flight 800 the
ground-maintenance crew locked-out the thrust reverser for engine #3 (treated
as a minimum equipment list item). In addition, severed cables for the engine
#3 thrust reverser were replaced. During refueling of the aircraft, the
volumetric shutoff (VSO) control was believed to have been triggered before the
tanks were full. To continue the pressure fueling, a TWA mechanic overrode the
automatic VSO by pulling the volumetric fuse and an overflow circuit breaker.
Maintenance records indicate that the airplane had numerous VSO-related
maintenance writeups in the weeks before the accident. TWA 800 was scheduled to
depart JFK for Paris around 19:00, but the flight was delayed until 20:02 by a
disabled piece of ground equipment and a passenger/baggage mismatch. After the
owner of the baggage in question was confirmed to be on board, the flight crew
prepared for departure and the aircraft pushed back from gate 27 at the TWA
Flight Center. TWA 800 then received a series of heading changes and generally
increasing altitude assignments as it climbed to its intended cruising
altitude. Weather in the area was light winds with scattered clouds, and there
were dusk lighting conditions. The last radio transmission from the airplane
occurred at 20:30 when the flight crew received and then acknowledged
instructions from Boston Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) to climb to .
The last recorded radar transponder return from the airplane was recorded by
the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) radar site at Trevose, Pennsylvania
at 20:31:12. Thirty-eight seconds later, the captain of an Eastwind Airlines
Boeing 737 reported to Boston ARTCC that he "just saw an explosion out here,"
adding, "we just saw an explosion up ahead of us here...about 16,000 feet
[4,900m] or something like that, it just went down into the water."
Subsequently, many air traffic control facilities in the New York/Long Island
area received reports of an explosion from other pilots operating in the area.
Many witnesses in the vicinity of the crash stated that they saw or heard
explosions, accompanied by a large fireball or fireballs over the ocean, and
observed debris, some of which was burning, falling into the water. Although
individuals in various civilian, military and police vessels reached the crash
site and searched for survivors within minutes of the initial water impact, no
survivors were found, making TWA 800 the second deadliest aircraft accident in
the United States at that time. Initial investigation. The NTSB was notified
about 20:50 the day of the accident; a full go-team was assembled in
Washington, D.C. and arrived on scene early the next morning. Meanwhile,
initial witness descriptions led many to believe the cause of the crash was a
bomb or missile attack. The NTSB does not investigate criminal activity. In
past investigations, once it was established that a crash was, in fact, a
criminal act, the FBI had become the lead federal investigative body, with the
NTSB providing any requested support. In the case of TWA 800, the FBI initiated
a parallel criminal investigation alongside the NTSB's accident investigation.
Search and recovery operations. Search and recovery operations were conducted
by federal, state, and local agencies, as well as government contractors.
Remote-operated vehicles (ROVs), side-scan sonar, and laser line-scanning
equipment were used to search for and investigate underwater debris fields.
Victims and wreckage were recovered by Scuba divers and ROVs; later scallop
trawlers were used to recover wreckage embedded in the ocean floor. In one of
the largest diver-assisted salvage operations ever conducted, often working in
very difficult and dangerous conditions, over 95% of the airplane wreckage was
eventually recovered. The search and recovery effort identified three main
areas of wreckage underwater. The yellow zone, red zone, and green zone
contained wreckage from front, center, and rear sections of the airplane,
respectively. The green zone with the aft portion of the aircraft was located
the furthest along the flight path. Pieces of wreckage were transported by boat
to shore and then by truck to leased hangar space at the former Grumman
Aircraft facility in Calverton, New York for storage, examination, and
reconstruction. This facility became the command center and headquarters for
the investigation. NTSB and FBI personnel were present to observe all transfers
to preserve the evidentiary value of the wreckage. The Cockpit Voice Recorder
and Flight Data Recorder were recovered by U.S. Navy divers a week after the
accident; they were immediately shipped to the NTSB laboratory in Washington,
D.C., for readout. The victims were transported to the Suffolk County Medical
Examiner's Office in Hauppauge, New York. Tensions in the investigation.
Relatives of TWA 800 passengers and crew, as well as the media, gathered at a
Ramada Plaza Hotel near JFK. Many waited until the remains of their family
members had been recovered, identified and released. Grief turned to anger at
TWA's delay in confirming the passenger list, conflicting information from
agencies and officials, and mistrust of the recovery operation's priorities.
Although NTSB vice chairman Robert Francis stated that all bodies were being
retrieved as soon as they were spotted, and that wreckage was being recovered
only if divers believed that victims were hidden underneath, many families were
suspicious that investigators were not being truthful, or withholding
information. Much anger and political pressure was also directed at Suffolk
County Medical Examiner Dr. Charles V. Wetli as recovered bodies backlogged at
the morgue. Under constant and considerable pressure to identify victims with
minimal delay, pathologists worked non-stop. Since the primary objective was to
identify all remains rather than performing a detailed forensic autopsy, the
thoroughness of the examinations was highly variable. Ultimately, remains of
all 230 victims were recovered and identified, the last over 10 months later.
With lines of authority unclear, differences in agendas and culture between the
FBI and NTSB resulted in discord. The FBI, from the start assuming that a
criminal act had occurred, saw the NTSB as indecisive. Expressing frustration
at the NTSB's unwillingness to speculate on a cause, one FBI agent described
the NTSB as "No opinions. No nothing". Meanwhile the NTSB was required to
refute or play down speculation about conclusions and evidence, frequently
supplied to reporters by law enforcement officials and politicians. Witness
interviews. Many witnesses to the accident had seen a "streak of light" that
was usually described as ascending, moving to a point where a large fireball
appeared, with several witnesses reporting that the fireball split in two as it
descended toward the water. There was intense public interest in these witness
reports and much speculation that the reported streak of light was a missile
that had struck TWA 800, causing the airplane to explode. These witness
accounts were a major reason for the initiation and duration of the FBI's
criminal investigation. Approximately 80 FBI agents conducted interviews with
potential witnesses daily. No verbatim records of the witness interviews were
produced; instead, the agents who conducted the interviews wrote summaries that
they then submitted. Witnesses were not asked to review or correct the
summaries. Included in some of the witness summaries were drawings or diagrams
of what the witness observed. Within days of the crash the NTSB announced its
intent to form its own witness group and to interview witnesses to the crash.
However, after the FBI raised concerns about non-governmental parties in the
NTSB's investigation having access to this information and possible
prosecutorial difficulties resulting from multiple interviews of the same
witness, the NTSB deferred and initially neither interviewed nor re-interviewed
witnesses to the crash. Further investigation and analysis. Examination of the
Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) and Flight Data Recorder data showed a normal
takeoff and climb, with the aircraft in normal flight before both abruptly
stopped at 20:31:12. A noise recorded on the last few tenths of a second of the
CVR was similar to the last noises recorded from other airplanes, that had
experienced in-flight breakups. This, together with the distribution of
wreckage and witness reports, all indicated a catastrophic in-flight breakup of
TWA 800. Possible causes of the in-flight breakup. Investigators considered
several possible causes for the structural breakup: structural failure and
decompression, detonation of a high-energy explosive device, such as a missile
warhead exploding upon impact with the airplane or bomb exploding inside the
airplane, or a fuel/air explosion in the center wing fuel tank. Structural
failure and decompression. Close examination of the wreckage revealed no
evidence of structural faults such as fatigue, corrosion or mechanical damage
that could have caused the in-flight breakup. It was also suggested that the
breakup could have been initiated by an in-flight separation of the forward
cargo door; however, all evidence indicated that the door was closed and locked
at impact. The NTSB concluded that "the in-flight breakup of TWA flight 800 was
not initiated by a preexisting condition resulting in a structural failure and
decompression." Live missile or bomb detonation. A review of recorded data from
long-range and airport surveillance radars revealed multiple contacts of
airplanes/objects in TWA 800's vicinity at the time of the accident. None of
these contacts intersected TWA 800's position at any time. Attention was drawn
to data from the Islip, New York, ARTCC facility that showed three tracks in
the vicinity of TWA 800 that did not appear in any of the other radar data.
None of these sequences intersected TWA 800's position at any time either. All
the reviewed radar data showed no radar returns consistent with a missile or
other projectile traveling toward TWA 800. The NTSB addressed allegations that
the Islip radar data showed groups of military surface targets converging in a
suspicious manner in an area around the accident, and that a 30-knot radar
track, never identified and 3Â nmi from the crash site, was involved in foul
play, as evidenced by its failure to divert from its course and assist with the
search and rescue operations. Military records examined by the NTSB showed no
military surface vessels within 15Â nmi of TWA 800 at the time of the accident.
In addition, the records indicated that the closest area scheduled for military
use and prohibited to civilian air traffic at the time of the accident, warning
area W-387A/B, was 160Â nmi south. The NTSB reviewed the 30-knot target track
to try to determine why it did not divert from its course and proceed to the
area where the TWA 800 wreckage had fallen. TWA 800 was behind the target, and
with the likely forward-looking perspective of the target's occupant(s), the
occupants would not have been in a position to observe the aircraft's breakup
and/or subsequent explosions/fireball(s). Additionally, it was unlikely that
the occupants of the target track would have been able to hear the explosions
over the sound of its engines and the noise of the hull traveling through
water, even more so if the occupants were in an enclosed bridge or cabin.
Further, review of the Islip radar data for other similar summer days and
nights in 1999 indicated that the 30-knot track was consistent with normal
commercial fishing, recreational, and/or cargo vessel traffic. Trace amounts of
explosive residue were detected on three samples of material from three
separate locations of the recovered airplane wreckage (described by the FBI as
a piece of canvas-like material and two pieces of a floor panel). These samples
were submitted to the FBI's laboratory in Washington, D.C., which determined
that one sample contained traces of cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX),
another nitroglycerin, and the third a combination of RDX and pentaerythritol
tetranitrate (PETN); these findings received much media attention at the time.
In addition, the backs of several damaged passenger seats were observed to have
an unknown red/brown-shaded substance on them. However, according to the seat
manufacturer, the locations and appearance of this substance were consistent
with adhesive used in the construction of the seats, and additional laboratory
testing by NASA identified the substance as being consistent with adhesives.
Further examination of the airplane structure, seats, and other interior
components found no damage typically associated with a high-energy explosion of
a bomb or missile warhead ("severe pitting, cratering, petalling, or hot gas
washing"). This included the pieces on which trace amounts of explosives were
found. Of the 5 percent of the fuselage that was not recovered, none of the
missing areas were large enough to have covered all the damage that would have
been caused by the detonation of a bomb or missile. None of the victims'
remains showed any evidence of injuries that could have been caused by high-
energy explosives. The NTSB considered the possibility that the explosive
residue was due to contamination from the aircraft's use in 1991 transporting
troops during the Gulf War or its use in a dog-training explosive detection
exercise about one month before the accident. However, testing conducted by the
FAA's Technical Center indicated that residues of the type of explosives found
on the wreckage would dissipate completely after 2 days of immersion in sea
water (almost all recovered wreckage was immersed longer than 2 days). The NTSB
concluded that it was "quite possible" that the explosive residue detected was
transferred from military ships or ground vehicles, or the clothing and boots
of military personnel, onto the wreckage during or after the recovery operation
and was not present when the aircraft crashed into the water. Although it was
unable to determine the exact source of the trace amounts of explosive residue
found on the wreckage, the lack of any other corroborating evidence associated
with a high-energy explosion led the NTSB to conclude that "the in-flight
breakup of TWA flight 800 was not initiated by a bomb or missile strike." Fuel/
air explosion in the center wing fuel tank. In order to evaluate the sequence
of structural breakup of the airplane, the NTSB formed the Sequencing Group,
which examined individual pieces of the recovered structure, two-dimensional
reconstructions or layouts of sections of the airplane, and various-sized
three-dimensional reconstructions of portions of the airplane. In addition, the
locations of pieces of wreckage at the time of recovery and differences in fire
effects on pieces that are normally adjacent to each other were evaluated. The
Sequencing Group concluded that the first event in the breakup sequence was a
fracture in the wing center section of the aircraft, caused by an "overpressure
event" in the center wing fuel tank (CWT). An overpressure event was defined as
a rapid increase in pressure resulting in failure of the structure of the CWT.
Because there was no evidence that a high-energy explosive device detonated in
this (or any other) area of the airplane, this overpressure event could only
have been caused by a fuel/air explosion in the CWT. Although only a small
amount of fuel was present in the CWT of TWA 800, tests recreating the
conditions of the flight showed the remaining fuel/air vapor to be flammable. A
major reason for the flammability of the fuel/air vapor in the CWT of the 747
was the large amount of heat generated and transferred to the CWT by air
conditioning packs located directly below the tank; with the CWT temperature
raised to a sufficient level, a single ignition source could cause an
explosion. Computer modeling and scale model testing were used to predict and
demonstrate how an explosion would progress in a 747 CWT. During this time,
quenching was identified as an issue, where the explosion would extinguish
itself as it passed through the complex structure of the CWT. Because the
research data regarding quenching was limited, a complete understanding of
quenching behavior was not possible, and the issue of quenching remained
unresolved. In order to better determine whether a fuel/air vapor explosion in
the CWT would generate sufficient pressure to break apart the fuel tank and
lead to the destruction of the airplane, tests were conducted in July and
August 1997, using a retired Air France 747 at Bruntingthorpe Airfield,
England. These tests simulated a fuel/air explosion in the CWT by igniting a
propane/air mixture; this resulted in the failure of the tank structure due to
overpressure. While the NTSB acknowledged that the test conditions at
Bruntingthorpe were not fully comparable to the conditions that existed on TWA
800 at the time of the accident, previous fuel explosions in the CWTs of
commercial airliners such as Avianca Flight 203 and Philippine Airlines Flight
143 confirmed that a CWT explosion could break apart the fuel tank and lead to
the destruction of an airplane. Ultimately, based on "the accident airplane's
breakup sequence; wreckage damage characteristics; scientific tests and
research on fuels, fuel tank explosions, and the conditions in the CWT at the
time of the accident; and analysis of witness information," the NTSB concluded
that "the TWA flight 800 in-flight breakup was initiated by a fuel/air
explosion in the CWT." In-flight breakup sequence and crippled flight. [[File:

TWA 800 wreckage to illustrate the breakup sequence. "Video: Part 1, Part 2
(RealMedia format)"]] Recovery locations of the wreckage from the ocean (the
red, yellow, and green zones) clearly indicated that: (1) the red area pieces
(from the forward portion of the wing center section and a ring of fuselage
directly in front) were the earliest pieces to separate from the airplane; (2)
the forward fuselage section departed simultaneously with or shortly after the
red area pieces, landing relatively intact in the yellow zone; (3) the green
area pieces (wings and the aft portion of the fuselage) remained intact for a
period after the separation of the forward fuselage, and impacted the water in
the green zone. Fire damage and soot deposits on the recovered wreckage
indicated that some areas of fire existed on the airplane as it continued on in
crippled flight after the loss of the forward fuselage. After about 34 seconds
(based on information from witness documents), the outer portions of both the
right and left wings failed, likely causing fuel-fed fires that were the
beginning of the fireball described by witnesses. Shortly after, the left wing
separated from what remained of the main fuselage, which resulted in further
development of the fuel-fed fireballs as the pieces of wreckage fell to the
ocean. Only the FAA radar facility in North Truro, Massachusetts, using
specialized processing software from the United States Air Force 84th Radar
Evaluation Squadron, was capable of estimating the altitude of TWA 800 after it
lost power after the CWT explosion. However, because of accuracy limitations,
this radar data could not be used to determine whether the aircraft climbed
after the nose separated. Instead, the NTSB conducted a series of computer
simulations to examine the flightpath of the main portion of the fuselage.
Hundreds of simulations were run using various combinations of possible times
the nose of TWA 800 separated (the exact time was unknown), different models of
the behavior of the crippled aircraft (the aerodynamic properties of the
aircraft without its nose could only be estimated), and longitudinal radar data
(the recorded radar tracks of the east/west position of TWA 800 from various
sites differed). These simulations indicated that after the loss of the forward
fuselage the remainder of the aircraft continued on in crippled flight, then
pitched up while rolling to the left (north), climbing to a maximum altitude
between and from its last recorded altitude, . Analysis of reported witness
observations. At the start of FBI's investigation, because of the possibility
that international terrorists might have been involved, assistance was
requested from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). CIA analysts, relying on
sound-propagation analysis, were able to conclude that the witnesses could not
be describing a missile approaching an intact aircraft, but were seeing a trail
of burning fuel coming from the aircraft after the initial explosion. This
conclusion was reached after calculating how long it took for the sound of the
initial explosion to reach the witnesses, and using that to correlate the
witness observations with the accident sequence. In all cases the witnesses
could not be describing a missile approaching an intact aircraft, as the plane
had already exploded before their observations began. As the investigation
progressed, the NTSB decided to form a witness group to more fully address the
accounts of witnesses. From November 1996, through April 1997, this group
reviewed witness documents on loan from the FBI (with personal information
redacted), and conducted interviews with crewmembers from a New York Air
National Guard HH-60 helicopter and C-130 airplane, as well as a U.S. Navy P-
3 airplane that were flying in the vicinity of TWA 800 at the time of the
accident. In February 1998, the FBI, having closed its active investigation,
agreed to fully release the witness documents to the NTSB. With access to these
documents no longer controlled by the FBI, the NTSB formed a second witness
group to review the documents. Because of the amount of time that had elapsed
(about 21 months) before the NTSB received information about the identity of
the witnesses, the witness group chose not to re-interview most of the
witnesses, but instead to rely on the original FBI documents as the best
available evidence of the observations initially reported by the witnesses.
However, despite the two and a half years that had elapsed since the accident,
the witness group did interview the captain of Eastwind Airlines flight 507,
who was the first to report the explosion of TWA 800, because of his vantage
point and experience as an airline pilot. The NTSB's review of the released
witness documents determined that they contained 736 witness accounts, of which
258 were characterized as "streak of light" witnesses ("an object moving in the
sky...variously described a point of light, fireworks, a flare, a shooting
star, or something similar.") The NTSB Witness Group concluded that the streak
of light reported by witnesses might have been the actual airplane during some
stage of its flight before the fireball developed, noting that most of the 258
streak of light accounts were generally consistent with the calculated
flightpath of the accident airplane after the CWT explosion. However, 38
witnesses described a streak of light that ascended vertically, or nearly so,
and these accounts "seem to be inconsistent with the accident airplane's
flightpath." In addition, 18 witnesses reported seeing a streak of light that
originated at the surface, or the horizon, which did not "appear to be
consistent with the airplane's calculated flightpath and other known aspects of
the accident sequence." Regarding these differing accounts, the NTSB noted that
based on their experience in previous investigations "witness reports are often
inconsistent with the known facts or with other witnesses' reports of the same
events." The interviews conducted by the FBI focused on the possibility of a
missile attack; suggested interview questions given to FBI agents such as
"Where was the sun in relation to the aircraft and the missile launch point?"
and "How long did the missile fly?" could have biased interviewees' responses
in some cases. The NTSB concluded that given the large number of witnesses in
this case, they "did not expect all of the documented witness observations to
be consistent with one another." and "did not view these apparently anomalous
witness reports as persuasive evidence that some witnesses might have observed
a missile." After missile visibility tests were conducted in April 2000, at
Eglin Air Force Base, Fort Walton Beach, Florida, the NTSB determined that if
witnesses had observed a missile attack they would have seen: (1) a light from
the burning missile motor ascending very rapidly and steeply for about 8
seconds; (2) the light disappearing for up to 7 seconds; (3) upon the missile
striking the aircraft and igniting the CWT another light, moving considerably
more slowly and more laterally than the first, for about 30 seconds; (4) this
light descending while simultaneously developing into a fireball falling toward
the ocean. None of the witness documents described such a scenario. Because of
their unique vantage points and/or the level of precision and detail provided
in their accounts, five witness accounts generated special interest: the pilot
of Eastwind Airlines flight 507, the crew members in the HH-60 helicopter, a
streak-of-light witness aboard US Airways flight 217, a land witness on the
Beach Lane Bridge in Westhampton Beach, New York as well as a witness on a boat
near Great Gun Beach. Advocates of a missile-attack scenario asserted that some
of these witnesses observed a missile; however, analysis demonstrated that the
observations were not consistent with a missile attack on TWA 800, but instead
were consistent with these witnesses having observed some part of the in-flight
fire and breakup sequence after the CWT explosion. The NTSB concluded that "the
witness observations of a streak of light were not related to a missile and
that the streak of light reported by most of these witnesses was burning fuel
from the accident airplane in crippled flight during some portion of the post-
explosion, preimpact breakup sequence". The NTSB further concluded that "the
witnesses' observations of one or more fireballs were of the airplane's burning
wreckage falling toward the ocean". Possible ignition sources of the center
wing fuel tank. In an attempt to determine what ignited the inflammable fuel/
air vapor in the CWT and caused the explosion, the NTSB evaluated numerous
potential ignition sources. All but one were considered very unlikely to have
been the source of ignition. Missile fragment or small explosive charge.
Although the NTSB had already reached the conclusion that a missile strike did
not cause the structural failure of the airplane, the possibility that a
missile could have exploded close enough to TWA 800 for a missile fragment to
have entered the CWT and ignited the fuel/air vapor, yet far enough away not to
have left any damage characteristic of a missile strike was considered.
Computer simulations using missile performance data simulated a missile
detonating in a location such that a fragment from the warhead could penetrate
the CWT. Based on these simulations the NTSB concluded that it was "very
unlikely" that a warhead detonated in such a location where a fragment could
penetrate the CWT, but no other fragments impact the surrounding airplane
structure leaving distinctive impact marks. Similarly, the investigation
considered the possibility that a small explosive charge placed on the CWT
could have been the ignition source. Testing by the NTSB and the British
Defence Evaluation and Research Agency demonstrated that when metal of the same
type and thickness of the CWT was penetrated by a small charge, there was
petalling of the surface where the charge was placed, pitting on the adjacent
surfaces, and visible hot gas washing damage in the surrounding area. Since
none of the recovered CWT wreckage exhibited these damage characteristics, and
none of the areas of missing wreckage were large enough to encompass all the
expected damage, the investigation concluded that this scenario was "very
unlikely." Other potential sources. The NTSB also investigated whether the
fuel/air mixture in the CWT could have been ignited by lightning strike, meteor
strike, auto-ignition or hot surface ignition, a fire migrating to the CWT from
another fuel tank via the vent system, an uncontained engine failure, a turbine
burst in the air conditioning packs beneath the CWT, a malfunctioning CWT
jettison/override pump, a malfunctioning CWT scavenger pump, or static
electricity. After analysis the investigation determined that these potential
sources were "very unlikely" to have been the source of ignition. Fuel quantity
indication system. The FAA and airplane manufacturers had assumed that a
combustible fuel/air mixture would exist at all times in fuel tanks;
consequently, airplane designers attempted to eliminate all possible sources of
ignition in the fuel tanks. The primary means of ensuring this were to protect
all devices from intrusion of vapor and to keep voltages and currents being
used by the Fuel Quantity Indication System (FQIS) very small. In the case of
the 747-100 series, the only wiring located inside the CWT was wiring
associated with the FQIS. In order for the FQIS to be the ignition source, a
transfer of higher than normal voltage to the FQIS needed to have occurred, as
well as some mechanism whereby the excess energy was released by the FQIS
wiring into the CWT. While the NTSB determined that factors suggesting the
likelihood of a short circuit event existed, they added that "neither the
release mechanism nor the location of the ignition inside the CWT could be
determined from the available evidence." Nonetheless, the NTSB concluded that
"the ignition energy for the CWT explosion most likely entered the CWT through
the FQIS wiring." Though the FQIS itself was designed to prevent danger from
its normal operation by minimizing voltages and currents, the innermost tube of
the FQIS compensator showed damage similar to that of the compensator tube that
was the ignition source for the surge tank fire that destroyed a 747 near
Madrid in 1976. This was not considered "proof" of a source of ignition. There
was evidence of arcing in a wire bundle that included FQIS wiring that
connected with the Center Wing Tank. There was also arcing evidenced on two
wires sharing a cable raceway with FQIS wiring at station 955. The Captain's
Cockpit Voice Recorder channel showed two "dropouts" of background power
harmonics in the second before the recording ended (with the separation of the
nose). This might well be the signature of an arc on cockpit wiring adjacent to
the FQIS wiring. The captain commented on the "crazy" readings of the number 4
engine fuel flow gauge about 2-1/2 minutes before the CVR recording ended.
Finally, the Center Wing Tank fuel quantity gauge was recovered and indicated
640Â pounds instead of the 300Â pounds that had been loaded into that tank.
Experiments showed that applying power to a wire leading to the fuel quantity
gauge can cause the digital display to change by several hundred pounds before
the circuit breaker trips. Thus the gauge anomaly could have been caused by a
short to the FQIS wiring. The NTSB concluded that the most likely source of
sufficient voltage to cause ignition was a short from damaged wiring, or within
electrical components of the FQIS. As not all components and wiring were
recovered, it was not possible to pin-point the source of the necessary
voltage. Conclusions. During the course of its investigation, and in its final
report, the NTSB issued fifteen safety recommendations, mostly covering fuel
tank and wiring-related issues. Among the recommendations was that significant
consideration should be given to the development of modifications such as
nitrogen-inerting systems for new airplane designs and, where feasible, for
existing airplanes. Alternative theories. The NTSB's conclusions about the
cause of the TWA 800 disaster took four years and one month to be published.
The FBI's earliest investigations and interviews, later used by the NTSB, were
performed under the assumption of a missile attack, a fact noted in the NTSB's
final report. Six months into the investigation, the NTSB's chairman, Jim Hall,
was quoted as saying, "All three theoriesâ€”a bomb, a missile or mechanical
failureâ€”remain." Speculation was fueled in part by early descriptions,
visuals, and eyewitness accounts of this jet disaster, including a sudden
explosion and trails of fire in the sky; particularly, trails of fire moving in
an upward direction. The two most prevalent specific theories around TWA 800
are that of a terrorist bomb on board, or a missile striking the plane
(attributed by some to American armed forces and by others to non-state
actors). Those supporting these alternative explanations for the crash
typically claim that the NTSB's explanation was created as a cover-up; that the
NTSB did not investigate sufficiently; or that the NTSB did not have all the
evidence it should have had to reach the correct conclusion. Aftermath. Many
users of the Internet responded to the incident. The resulting web traffic set
records for Internet activity in 1996. CNN's traffic quadrupled to 3.9Â million
hits per day. After the flight crashed, the website of "The New York Times" had
its traffic increase to one and one half million hits per day, an increase by
half of its previous rate. In 1996 few U.S. government websites were updated
daily; the United States Navy's website regarding the crash was constantly
updated and had detailed information about the salvage of the crash site.
International Memorial. The TWA Flight 800 International Memorial was dedicated
in a parcel immediately adjoining the main pavilion at Smith Point County Park
in Shirley, New York, on July 14, 2004. Funds for the memorial were raised by
the Families of TWA Flight 800 Association. David Busch of Busch Associates PC
Bay Shore, New York designed the memorial. The memorial includes landscaped
grounds, flags from the 13 countries of the victims, and a curved black granite
memorial with the names engraved on one side and an illustration on the other
of a wave releasing 230 seagulls into the sky. In July 2006 an abstract design
of a high lighthouse in black granite designed by Harry Edward Seaman, who had
lost his cousin in the crash, was added. The lighthouse sits above a tomb
holding many of the victims' personal belongings. The wreckage is now
permanently stored in an NTSB facility in Ashburn, Loudoun County, Virginia
that was custom built for the purpose. The reconstructed aircraft is used to
train accident investigators. On July 17, 2008 the Secretary of Transportation
visited the facility and announced a final rule designed to prevent more
accidents caused by explosions in fuel tanks. The NTSB first recommended such a
rule just five months after the Flight 800 accident and thirty-three years
after a similar recommendation issued by the Civil Aeronautics Board Bureau of
Safety on December 17, 1963, nine days after the crash of Pan Am Flight 214. In
2009 Boeing advised the FAA that its new Boeing 787 Dreamliner could not meet
the new safety standards. The FAA proposed to relax the safeguards for
preventing sparks inside the fuel tank, calling them "impractical."
