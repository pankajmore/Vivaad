History of Liechtenstein Political identity came to the territory now occupied
by the Principality of Liechtenstein in 814, with the formation of the
subcountry of Lower Rhaetia. Liechtenstein's borders have remained unchanged
since 1434, when the Rhine established the border between the Holy Roman Empire
and the Swiss cantons. Antiquity. A Roman road crossed the region from south to
north, traversing the Alps by the SplÃ¼gen Pass and following the right bank of
the Rhine at the edge of the floodplain, for long uninhabited because of
periodic flooding. Roman villas have been excavated in Schaanwald and Nendeln.
The late Roman influx of the Alemanni from the north is memorialized by the
remains of a Roman fort at Schaan. Middle Ages. The area, part of Raetia, was
incorporated into the Carolingian empire, and divided into countships, which
became subdivided over the generations. Because the duchy of Swabia lost its
duke in 1268 and was never restored, all vassals of the duchy became immediate
vassals of the Imperial Throne (as has happened in much of Westphalia when the
duchy of Saxons was divided and partially dissolved in aftermath of the defeat
of Henry the Lion). The medieval county of Vaduz was formed in 1342 as a small
subdivision of the Werdenberg county of the dynasty of Montfort of Vorarlberg.
The 15th century brought three wars and some devastation. The Principality
takes its name from the Liechtenstein family, rather than vice-versa, and the
family in turn takes its name from Castle Liechtenstein in Lower Austria, which
it owned from at least 1140 until the 13th century and from 1807 onwards. Over
the centuries, the family acquired huge landed estates, mostly in Moravia,
Lower Austria and Styria, but all of these rich territories were held in fief
under other more senior feudal lords, particularly under various lines of the
Habsburg family, to which many Liechtensteins were close advisors. Thus,
without holding any land directly under the Holy Roman Emperors, the
Liechtenstein dynasty was unable to meet the primary requirement to qualify for
a seat in the Imperial diet, the Reichstag, although its head was elevated to
princely rank in the late 17th century. Early modern era. Liechtenstein was
invaded by both Austrian and Swedish troops during the Thirty Years' War of
1618â€“1648. During the 17th century the country was afflicted by a plague and
also by a witch hunt, in which more than 100 persons were persecuted and
executed. Prince Johann Adam Andreas of Liechtenstein bought the domain of
Schellenberg in 1699 and the county of Vaduz in 1712. This Prince of
Liechtenstein had wide landholdings in Austria, Bohemia and Moravia, but none
of his lands were held directly from the Emperor. Thus, the prince was barred
from entry to the Council of Princes and the prestige and influence that would
entail. By acquiring the Lordships of Schellenberg and Vaduz, modest areas of
mountain villages each of which was directly subordinate to the Emperor because
there was no duke of Swabia any longer, the Prince of Liechtenstein achieved
his goal. The territory took the name of the family which now ruled it. On
January 23, 1719, Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor, decreed that the counties of
Vaduz and Schellenberg be promoted to a principality with the name
Liechtenstein for his servant Anton Florian of Liechtenstein whereby they
became "Heiliger RÃ¶mischer ReichsfÃ¼rst". Nineteenth century. Liechtenstein
became a sovereign state in 1806 when it joined Napoleon's Confederation of the
Rhine upon the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire. The French under Napoleon
occupied the country for a few years, but Liechtenstein retained its
independence in 1815. Soon afterward, Liechtenstein joined the German
Confederation (20 June 1815 â€“ 24 August 1866, which was presided over by the
Emperor of Austria). Then, in 1818, Johann I granted a constitution, although
it was limited in its nature. 1818 also saw the first visit of a member of the
house of Liechtenstein, Prince Alois. However, the first visit by a sovereign
prince would not occur until 1842. In 1862, a new Constitution was promulgated,
which provided for a Diet representative of the people. In 1868, after the
German Confederation dissolved, Liechtenstein disbanded its army of 80 men and
declared its permanent neutrality, which was respected during both World Wars.
Liechtenstein during the World Wars. Liechtenstein did not participate in World
War I, claiming neutrality. However, until the end of the war, Liechtenstein
was closely tied to Austria. In response, Allies imposed an economic embargo on
the principality. The economic devastation forced the country to conclude a
customs and monetary union with Switzerland. In 1919 Liechtenstein and
Switzerland signed a treaty under which Switzerland assumes the representation
of Liechtenstein interests at the diplomatic and consular level in countries
where it maintains a representation and Liechtenstein does not. In the spring
of 1938, just after the annexation of Austria into Greater Germany, eighty-four
year-old Prince Franz I abdicated, naming his thirty-one year-old third cousin,
Prince Franz Joseph II, as his successor. While Prince Franz I claimed that old
age was his reason for abdicating, it is believed that he had no desire to be
on the throne if Germany gobbled up its new neighbor, Liechtenstein. His wife,
whom he married in 1929, was a wealthy Jewish woman from Vienna, and local
Liechtenstein Nazis had already singled her out as their anti-Semitic
"problem". Although Liechtenstein had no official Nazi party, a Nazi sympathy
movement had been simmering for years within its National Union party. Prince
Franz Josef II became the first Prince of Liechtenstein to take up permanent
residence in Liechtenstein. During World War II, Liechtenstein remained
neutral, while family treasures within the war zone were brought to
Liechtenstein (and London) for safekeeping. At the close of the conflict,
Czechoslovakia and Poland, acting to seize what they considered to be German
possessions, expropriated the entirety of the Liechtenstein dynasty's
hereditary lands and possessions in Bohemia, Moravia, and Silesia â€” the
princes of Liechtenstein lived in Vienna until the Anschluss of 1938. The
expropriations (subject to modern legal dispute at the World Court) included
over 1,600 square kilometres (600Â mi.Â²) of agricultural and forest land, also
including several family castles and palaces. Citizens of Liechtenstein were
also forbidden from entering Czechoslovakia during the Cold War. Liechtenstein
gave asylum to approximately five hundred soldiers of the First Russian
National Army (a collaborationist Russian force within the German Wehrmacht) at
the close of World War II; this is commemorated by a monument at the border
town of Hinterschellenberg which is marked on the country's tourist map. The
act of granting asylum was no small matter as the country was poor and had
difficulty feeding and caring for such a large group of refugees. Eventually,
Argentina agreed to permanently resettle the asylum seekers. In contrast, the
British repatriated the Russians who fought on the side of Germany to the USSR,
where they were summarily treated as traitors and most of them executed,
including their families. The Post-War era. In dire financial straits following
the war, the Liechtenstein dynasty often resorted to selling family artistic
treasures, including for instance the portrait "Ginevra de' Benci" by Leonardo
da Vinci, which was purchased by the National Gallery of Art of the United
States in 1967. Liechtenstein prospered, however, during the decades following,
as its economy modernized with the advantage of low corporate tax rates which
drew many companies to the country. Liechtenstein became increasingly important
as a financial center. In 1989, Prince Hans-Adam II succeeded his father to the
throne, and in 1996, Russia returned the Liechtenstein family's archives,
ending a long-running dispute between the two countries. In 1978, Liechtenstein
became member of the Council of Europe, and then joined the United Nations in
1990, the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) in 1991, and both the European
Economic Area (EEA) and World Trade Organization in 1995. Liechtenstein during
the 21st century. In a referendum on March 16, 2003, Prince Hans-Adam, who had
threatened to leave the country if he lost, won a large majority (64.3%) in
favour of overhauling the constitution to effectively give him more powers than
any other European monarch. The new constitution gave the prince the right to
dismiss governments and approve judicial nominees and allowed him to veto laws
simply by refusing to sign them within a six-month period. On August 15, 2003,
Hans-Adam announced he would step down in one year and hand over the reins to
his son Alois. On July 1, 2007, the Liechtenstein Ruling Prince, Hans-Adam II,
and Liechtenstein Prime Minister, Otmar Hasler, appointed Dr. Bruce S. Allen
and Mr. Leodis C. Matthews, both in the United States of America, as the first
two Honorary Consuls in history for the Principality of Liechtenstein.
