History of aviation The history of aviation has extended over more than two
thousand years from the earliest attempts in kites and gliders to powered
heavier-than-air, supersonic and hypersonic flight. The first form of man-made
flying objects were kites. The earliest known record of kite flying is from
around 200 BC in China, when a general flew a kite over enemy territory to
calculate the length of tunnel required to enter the region. Yuan Huangtou, a
Chinese prince, survived by tying himself to the kite. Leonardo da Vinci's
(15th c.) dream of flight found expression in several designs, but he did not
attempt to demonstrate his ideas by actually constructing them. With the
efforts to analyze the atmosphere in the 17th and 18th century, gases such as
hydrogen were discovered which in turn led to the invention of hydrogen
balloons. Various theories in mechanics by physicists during the same period of
time, notably fluid dynamics and Newton's laws of motion, led to the foundation
of modern aerodynamics. Tethered balloons filled with hot air were used in the
first half of the 19th century and saw considerable action in several mid-
century wars, most notably the American Civil War, where balloons provided
observation during the Battle of Petersburg. Experiments with gliders provided
the groundwork for heavier-than-air craft, and by the early 20th century
advances in engine technology and aerodynamics made controlled, powered flight
possible for the first time. Mythology. Human ambition to fly is illustrated in
mythological literature of several cultures; the wings made out of wax and
feathers by Daedalus in Greek mythology, or the Pushpaka Vimana of king Ravana
in Ramayana, for instance. Early attempts. Flight automaton in Greece. Around
400 BC, Archytas, the Greek philosopher, mathematician, astronomer, statesman
and strategist, designed and built a bird-shaped, apparently steam powered
model named ""The Pigeon"" ( "Peristera"), which is said to have flown some 200
meters. According to Aulus Gellius, the mechanical bird was suspended on a
string or pivot and was powered by a "concealed aura or spirit". Hot air
balloons, glider and kites in China. However, the device based on a lamp in a
paper shell is documented earlier, and according to Joseph Needham, hot-air
balloons in China were known from the 3rd century BC. In the 5th century BCE Lu
Ban is claimed to have invented a 'wooden bird' which may have been a large
kite, or which may have been an early glider. In 1st century AD, when Wang Mang
tried to recruit specialist as scout to Xiong Nu, a man binding himself with
bird feather glided about 100 meters, but finally landed. Manned kite. Yuan
Huangtou, Ye, first manned kite glide to take off from a tower ‚Äî 559 During
the Yuan dynasty (13th c.) under rulers like Kublai Khan, the rectangular lamps
became popular in festivals, when they would attract huge crowds. During the
Mongol Empire, the design may have spread along the Silk Route into Central
Asia and the Middle East. Almost identical floating lights with a rectangular
lamp in thin paper scaffolding are common in Tibetan celebrations and in the
Hindu festival of lights, Diwali. However, there is no evidence that these were
used for human flight. Gliders in Europe. In the 9th century, at the age of 65,
the Muslim Andalusian polymath Abbas Ibn Firnas is said to have flown from the
hill Jabal al-'arus by employing a rudimentary glider. While "alighting again
on the place whence he had started," he eventually crashed and sustained injury
which some contemporary critics attributed to a lack of tail. Between 1000 and
1010, the English Benedictine monk Eilmer of Malmesbury flew for about 200
meters using a glider (c. 1010), but he too sustained injuries. The event is
recorded in the work of the eminent medieval historian William of Malmesbury in
about 1125. From Renaissance to the 18th century. Some six centuries after Ibn
Firnas, Leonardo da Vinci developed a hang glider design in which the inner
parts of the wings are fixed, and some control surfaces are provided towards
the tips (as in the gliding flight in birds). While his drawings exist and are
deemed flightworthy in principle, he himself never flew in it. Based on his
drawings, and using materials that would have been available to him, a
prototype constructed in the late 20th century was shown to fly. However, his
sketchy design was interpreted with modern knowledge of aerodynamic principles,
and whether his actual ideas would have flown is not known. A model he built
for a test flight in 1496 did not fly, and some other designs, such as the
four-person screw-type helicopter, have severe flaws. Italian inventor, Tito
Livio Burattini, invited by the Polish King W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV to his court in
Warsaw, built a model aircraft with four fixed glider wings in 1647. Described
as "four pairs of wings attached to an elaborate 'dragon'", it was said to have
successfully lifted a cat in 1648 but not Burattini himself. He promised that
"only the most minor injuries" would result from landing the craft. His "Dragon
Volant" is considered "the most elaborate and sophisticated aeroplane to be
built before the 19th Century". In 1670 Francesco Lana de Terzi published work
that suggested lighter than air flight would be possible by having copper foil
spheres that contained a vacuum that would be lighter than the displaced air,
lift an airship (rather literal from his drawing). While not being completely
off the mark, he did fail to realize that the pressure of the surrounding air
would crush the spheres. In 1709 Bartolomeu de Gusm√£o presented a petition to
King John V of Portugal, begging for support for his invention of an airship,
in which he expressed the greatest confidence. The public test of the machine,
which was set for June 24, 1709, did not take place. According to contemporary
reports, however, Gusm√£o appears to have made several less ambitious
experiments with this machine, descending from eminences. It is certain that
Gusm√£o was working on this principle at the public exhibition he gave before
the Court on August 8, 1709, in the hall of the Casa da √çndia in Lisbon, when
he propelled a ball to the roof by combustion. Modern flight. Lighter than air.
Ballooning became a major "rage" in Europe in the late 18th century, providing
the first detailed understanding of the relationship between altitude and the
atmosphere. Work on developing a steerable (or dirigible) balloon (now called
an airship) continued sporadically throughout the 19th century. The first
powered, controlled, sustained lighter-than-air flight is believed to have
taken place in 1852 when Henri Giffard flew in France, with a steam engine
driven craft. Non-steerable balloons were employed during the American Civil
War by the Union Army Balloon Corps. The young Ferdinand von Zeppelin first
flew as a balloon passenger with the Union Army of the Potomac in 1863. Another
advance was made in 1884, when the first fully controllable free-flight was
made in a French Army electric-powered airship, La France, by Charles Renard
and Arthur Krebs. The long, airship covered in 23 minutes with the aid of an
8¬Ω horsepower electric motor. However, these aircraft were generally short-
lived and extremely frail. Routine, controlled flights would not occur until
the advent of the internal combustion engine (see below.) Although airships
were used in both World War I and II, and continue on a limited basis to this
day, their development has been largely overshadowed by heavier-than-air craft.
Heavier than air. Supporting the aircraft. The first published paper on
aviation was "Sketch of a Machine for Flying in the Air" by Emanuel Swedenborg
published in 1716. This flying machine consisted of a light frame covered with
strong canvas and provided with two large oars or wings moving on a horizontal
axis, arranged so that the upstroke met with no resistance while the downstroke
provided lifting power. Swedenborg knew that the machine would not fly, but
suggested it as a start and was confident that the problem would be solved. He
wrote: "It seems easier to talk of such a machine than to put it into
actuality, for it requires greater force and less weight than exists in a human
body. The science of mechanics might perhaps suggest a means, namely, a strong
spiral spring. If these advantages and requisites are observed, perhaps in time
to come some one might know how better to utilize our sketch and cause some
addition to be made so as to accomplish that which we can only suggest. Yet
there are sufficient proofs and examples from nature that such flights can take
place without danger, although when the first trials are made you may have to
pay for the experience, and not mind an arm or leg." Swedenborg would prove
prescient in his observation that a method of powering of an aircraft was one
of the critical problems to be overcome. During the last years of the 18th
century, Sir George Cayley started the first rigorous study of the physics of
flight. In 1799 he exhibited a plan for a glider, which except for planform was
completely modern in having a separate tail for control and having the pilot
suspended below the center of gravity to provide stability, and flew it as a
model in 1804. Over the next five decades Cayley worked on and off on the
problem, during which he formulated most of basic aerodynamic theory,
introducing such ideas as "lift" and "drag". He used both internal and external
combustion engines, fueled by gunpowder. Later Cayley turned his research to
building a full-scale version of his design, first flying it unmanned in 1849,
and in 1853 his coachman made a short flight at Brompton, near Scarborough in
Yorkshire. In 1848 John Stringfellow made a successful indoor test flight of a
steam-powered model, in Chard, Somerset, England. In 1856, Frenchman Jean-Marie
Le Bris made the first flight higher than his point of departure, by having his
glider ""L'Albatros artificiel"" pulled by a horse on a beach. He reportedly
achieved a height of 100 meters, over a distance of 200 meters. In 1866 Jan
Wnƒôk a Polish peasant, sculptor and carpenter is alleged to have built and
flown a controllable glider. Wneks claims are largely based on a local oral
tradition. Professor Tadeusz Seweryn, director of the Krak√≥w Museum of
Ethnography, claimed to have found church records substantiating these claims,
but has refused to make these available for independent scrutiny. Francis
Herbert Wenham built a series of unsuccessful unmanned gliders. He found that
the most of the lift from a bird-like wing appeared to be generated at the
front edge, and concluded correctly that long, thin wings would be better than
the bat-like ones suggested by many, because they would have more leading edge
for their area. Today this reltionship is known as aspect ratio of a wing. He
presented a paper on his work to the newly formed Aeronautical Society of Great
Britain in 1866, and decided to prove it by building the world's first wind
tunnel in 1871. Members of the Society used the tunnel and learned that
cambered wings generated considerably more lift than expected by Cayley's
Newtonian reasoning, with lift-to-drag ratios of about 5:1 at 15 degrees. This
clearly demonstrated the ability to build practical heavier-than-air flying
machines; what remained was the problem of controlling and powering the flight.
In 1871 the Frenchman Alphonse P√©naud successfully flew a model aircraft
powered by twisted rubber in Paris. This was significant because the model had
two features which gave it a degree of inherent stability: the rear-mounted
taiplane was set at a smaller angle of incidence than the wings, and the wings
were curved up at the tips, giving them dihedral. The principle of a difference
in angle of incidence between the lifting surface and a stabilising tailplane
was an original and important contribution to the theory of aeronautics. The
use of dihedral had been worked out by Cayley, although at the time Cayleys
work was largely unknown, and P√©naud had arrived at the idea independently.
Rubber powered model aircraft inspired a whole generation of future flight
pioneers, including the Wright brothers who were given them as toys when
children. In 1874, F√©lix du Temple built the ""Monoplane"", a large plane made
of aluminium in Brest, France, with a wingspan of 13 meters and a weight of
only 80 kilograms (without the driver). Several trials were made with the
plane, and it is generally recognized that it achieved lift off under its own
power after a ski-jump run, glided for a short time and returned safely to the
ground, making it the first successful powered flight in history, although the
flight was only a short distance and a short time. Controlling the aircraft.
The 1880s became a period of intense study, characterized by the "gentleman
scientists" who represented most research efforts until the 20th century.
Starting in the 1880s advances were made in construction that led to the first
truly practical gliders. Three people in particular were active: Otto
Lilienthal, Percy Pilcher and Octave Chanute. One of the first modern gliders
appears to have been built by John J. Montgomery; it flew one flight outside of
San Diego on August 28, 1883. It was not until many years later that his
efforts became well known. Another hang-glider had been constructed by Wilhelm
Kress as early as 1877 near Vienna. Otto Lilienthal of Germany duplicated
Wenham's work and greatly expanded on it in 1874, publishing his research in
1889. He also produced a series of gliders, and starting in 1891 was able to
make flights of 25 meters or more routinely. He rigorously documented his work,
including photographs, and for this reason is one of the best known of the
early pioneers. He also promoted the idea of "jumping before you fly",
suggesting that researchers should start with gliders and work their way up,
instead of simply designing a powered machine on paper and hoping it would
work. His type of aircraft is now known as a hang glider. Lilienthal died in
1896 when a gust of wind cause him to lose control: he fell from a height of
roughly and broke his back. He died the next day. By the timeof his death he
had made 2500 flights of up to 250 meters using a number of designs. Lilienthal
had been working on small engines suitable for powering his designs at the time
of his death. The Australian Lawrence Hargrave invented the box kite and
dedicated his life to constructing flying machines. In the 1880s he
experimented with monoplane models and by 1889 Hargrave had constructed a
rotary airplane engine, driven by compressed air. Picking up where Lilienthal
left off, Octave Chanute took up aircraft design after an early retirement, and
funded the development of several gliders. In the summer of 1896 his team flew
several of their designs many times at Miller Beach, Indiana, eventually
deciding that the best was a biplane design. Like Lilienthal, he documented his
work and also photographed it, and was busy corresponding with like-minded
researchers around the world. Chanute was particularly interested in solving
the problem of aerodynamic instability of the aircraft in flight, which birds
compensate for by instant corrections, but which humans would have to address
either with stabilizing and control surfaces or by moving the center of gravity
of the aircraft, as Lilienthal did. The most disconcerting problem was
longitudinal instability (divergence), because as the angle of attack of a wing
increases, the center of pressure moves forward and made the angle increase
more. Without immediate correction, the craft would pitch up and stall. Much
more difficult to understand was the relationship between lateral and
directional control. Powering the aircraft. Throughout this period, a number of
attempts were made to produce a true powered aircraft. However the majority of
these efforts were doomed to failure, being designed by ill-informed amateurs
who did not have a full understanding of the problems being discussed by
Lilienthal and Chanute. In 1884, Alexander Mozhaysky's monoplane design made
what is now considered to be a powered take off assisted by the use of ramp,
flying between 60‚Äì100¬ ft (20‚Äì30 m) near Krasnoye Selo, Russia. In France
Cl√©ment Ader built the steam-powered "Eole" and may have made a 50-meter
flight near Paris in 1890, which would be the first self-propelled "long
distance" flight in history. Ader then worked on a larger design which took
five years to build. In a test for the French military, the "Avion III" failed
to fly and, caught by a gust of wind, was seriously damaged. Ader's later
claims to have achieved a flight of 300 metres were later proved false. Sir
Hiram Maxim made a number of experiments in Britain, eventually building an
enormous machine with a wingspan of , powered by two advanced lightweight steam
engines which delivered 180¬ hp (134¬ kW) each. Maxim built it to study the
basic problems of construction, lift and propulsion. He used a track with a
second set of restraining rails for test runs. After a number of tests, on 31
July 1894 he started a series of runs at increasing power settings. The first
two were successful, with the craft lifting off the track. In the afternoon the
crew of three fired the boilers to full power, and after reaching a speed of
over 42¬ mph (68¬ km/h) about down the track the machine produced so much lift
it broke one of restraining rails and crashed after flying at a low altitudes
for about . Having spent around ¬£30,000, and unwilling to spend more, he
abandoned these experiments, only resuming his work in the 20th century, when
he tested a number of smaller designs powered by gasoline engines. Also in
Britain Percy Pilcher, who had worked for Maxim and had built and successfully
flown several gliders during the mid to late 1890s, constructed a prototype
powered aircraft in 1899 which, recent research has shown, would have been
capable of flight. However, he died in a glider accident before he was able to
test it. The "Pioneer Era" (1900‚Äì1914). Lighter than air. The first aircraft
to make routine controlled flights were non-rigid airships (later called
"blimps".) The most successful early pioneering pilot of this type of aircraft
was the Brazilian Alberto Santos-Dumont who effectively combined a balloon with
an internal combustion engine. On October 19, 1901 he flew his airship "Number
6" over Paris from the Parc de Saint Cloud around the Eiffel Tower and back in
under 30 minutes to win the Deutsch de la Meurthe prize. Santos-Dumont went on
to design and build several aircraft. Subsequent controversy surrounding his
and others' competing claims with regard to aircraft overshadowed his
unparalleled contributions to the development of airships. At the same time
that non-rigid airships were starting to have some success, rigid airships were
also becoming more advanced. Indeed, rigid body dirigibles would be far more
capable than fixed-wing aircraft in terms of pure cargo carrying capacity for
decades. Dirigible design and advancement was brought about by the German
count, Ferdinand von Zeppelin. Construction of the first Zeppelin airship began
in 1899 in a floating assembly hall on Lake Constance in the Bay of Manzell,
Friedrichshafen. This was intended to ease the starting procedure, as the hall
could easily be aligned with the wind. The prototype airship "LZ 1" (LZ for
"Luftschiff Zeppelin") had a length of 128 m, was driven by two 14.2¬ ps
(10.6¬ kW) Daimler engines and balanced by moving a weight between its two
nacelles. The first Zeppelin flight occurred on July 2, 1900. It lasted for
only 18 minutes, as LZ 1 was forced to land on the lake after the winding
mechanism for the balancing weight had broken. Upon repair, the technology
proved its potential in subsequent flights, beating the 6¬ m/s velocity record
of French airship "La France" by 3¬ m/s, but could not yet convince possible
investors. It would be several years before the Count was able to raise enough
funds for another try. Indeed, it was not until 1902 when Spanish engineer
Leonardo Torres Quevedo developed his own zeppelin airship, with which he
solved the serious balance problems the suspending gondola had shown in
previous flight attempts. Heavier than air. Langley. After a distinguished
career in astronomy and shortly before becoming Secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution, Samuel Pierpont Langley started a serious investigation into
aerodynamics at what is today the University of Pittsburgh. In 1891 he
published "Experiments in Aerodynamics" detailing his research, and then turned
to building his designs. On May 6, 1896, Langley's Aerodrome No.5 made the
first successful sustained flight of an unpiloted, engine-driven heavier-than-
air craft of substantial size. It was launched from a spring-actuated catapult
mounted on top of a houseboat on the Potomac River near Quantico, Virginia. Two
flights were made that afternoon, one of and a second of , at a speed of
approximately . On both occasions the Aerodrome No.5 landed in the water as
planned, because in order to save weight, it was not equipped with landing
gear. On November 28, 1896, another successful flight was made with the
Aerodrome No.6. This flight, of , was witnessed and photographed by Alexander
Graham Bell. The Aerodrome No.6 was actually Aerodrome No.4 greatly modified.
So little remained of the original aircraft that it was given the new
designation of Aerodrome No.6. With the success of the Aerodrome No. 5 and its
follow-on No. 6, Langley started looking for funding to build a full-scale man-
carrying version of his designs. Spurred by the Spanish-American War, the U.S.
government granted him $50,000 to develop a man-carrying flying machine for
surveillance. Langley planned on building a scaled-up version known as the
Aerodrome A, and started with the smaller Quarter-scale Aerodrome, which flew
twice on June 18, 1901, and then again with a newer and more powerful engine in
1903. With the basic design apparently successfully tested, he then turned to
the problem of a suitable engine. He contracted Stephen Balzer to build one,
but was disappointed when it delivered only 8 horsepower (6¬ kW) instead of
12¬ hp (9¬ kW) as he expected. Langley's assistant, Charles M. Manly, then
reworked the design into a five-cylinder water-cooled radial that delivered 52
horsepower (39¬ kW) at 950¬ rpm, a feat that took years to duplicate. Now with
both power and a design, Langley put the two together with great hopes. To his
dismay, the resulting aircraft proved to be too fragile. He had apparently
overlooked the effects of minimum gauge , and simply scaling up the original
small models resulted in a design that was too weak to hold itself together.
Two launches in late 1903 both ended with the Aerodrome immediately crashing
into the water. The pilot, Manly, was rescued each time. Langley's attempts to
gain further funding failed, and his efforts ended. Nine days after his second
abortive launch on December 8, the Wright brothers successfully flew their
aptly named "Flyer". Glenn Curtiss made several modifications to the Aerodrome
and successfully flew it in 1914‚Äîthe Smithsonian Institution thus continued
to assert that Langley's Aerodrome was the first machine "capable of flight".
The Wright Brothers. Following a step by step method, discovering aerodynamic
forces then controlling the flight, the brothers built and tested a series of
kite and glider designs from 1900 to 1902 before attempting to build a powered
design. The gliders worked, but not as well as the Wrights had expected based
on the experiments and writings of their 19th century predecessors. Their first
glider, launched in 1900, had only about half the lift they anticipated. Their
second glider, built the following year, performed even more poorly. Rather
than giving up, the Wrights constructed their own wind tunnel and created a
number of sophisticated devices to measure lift and drag on the 200 wing
designs they tested. As a result, the Wrights corrected earlier mistakes in
calculations regarding drag and lift. Their testing and calculating produced a
third glider with a larger aspect ratio and true three-axis control. They flew
it successfully hundreds of times in 1902, and it performed far better than the
previous models. In the end, by establishing their rigorous system of
designing, wind-tunnel testing of airfoils and flight testing of full-size
prototypes, the Wrights not only built a working aircraft but also helped
advance the science of aeronautical engineering. The Wrights appear to be the
first design team to make serious studied attempts to simultaneously solve the
power and control problems. Both problems proved difficult, but they never lost
interest. They solved the control problem by inventing wing warping for roll
control, combined with simultaneous yaw control with a steerable rear rudder.
Almost as an afterthought, they designed and built a low-powered internal
combustion engine. Relying on their wind tunnel data, they also designed and
carved wooden propellers that were more efficient than any before, enabling
them to gain adequate performance from their marginal engine power. Although
wing-warping was used only briefly during the history of aviation, when used
with a rudder it proved to be a key advance in order to control an aircraft.
While many aviation pioneers appeared to leave safety largely to chance, the
Wrights' design was greatly influenced by the need to teach themselves to fly
without unreasonable risk to life and limb, by surviving crashes. This
emphasis, as well as marginal engine power, was the reason for low flying speed
and for taking off in a head wind. Performance (rather than safety) was also
the reason for the rear-heavy design, because the canard could not be highly
loaded; anhedral wings were less affected by crosswinds and were consistent
with the low yaw stability. According to the Smithsonian Institution and
F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale (FAI), the Wrights made the first
sustained, controlled, powered heavier-than-air manned flight at Kill Devil
Hills, North Carolina, four miles (8¬ km) south of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina
on December 17, 1903. The first flight by Orville Wright, of in 12 seconds, was
recorded in a famous photograph. In the fourth flight of the same day, Wilbur
Wright flew in 59 seconds. The flights were witnessed by three coastal
lifesaving crewmen, a local businessman, and a boy from the village, making
these the first public flights and the first well-documented ones. Orville
described the final flight of the day: "The first few hundred feet were up and
down, as before, but by the time three hundred feet had been covered, the
machine was under much better control. The course for the next four or five
hundred feet had but little undulation. However, when out about eight hundred
feet the machine began pitching again, and, in one of its darts downward,
struck the ground. The distance over the ground was measured to be ; the time
of the flight was 59 seconds. The frame supporting the front rudder was badly
broken, but the main part of the machine was not injured at all. We estimated
that the machine could be put in condition for flight again in about a day or
two." They flew only about ten feet above the ground as a safety precaution, so
they had little room to maneuver, and all four flights in the gusty winds ended
in a bumpy and unintended "landing". Modern analysis by Professor Fred E. C.
Culick and Henry R. Rex (1985) has demonstrated that the 1903 Wright Flyer was
so unstable as to be almost unmanageable by anyone but the Wrights, who had
trained themselves in the 1902 glider. The Wrights continued flying at Huffman
Prairie near Dayton, Ohio in 1904‚Äì05. In May 1904 they introduced Flyer II, a
heavier and improved version of the original Flyer. On June 23, 1905 they first
flew a third machine Flyer III. After a severe crash on 14 July 1905, they
rebuilt the Flyer III and made important design changes. They almost doubled
the size of the elevator and rudder and moved them about twice the distance
from the wings. They added two fixed vertical vanes (called "blinkers") between
the elevators, and gave the wings a very slight dihedral. They disconnected the
rudder from the wing-warping control, and as in all future aircraft, placed it
on a separate control handle. When flights resumed the results were immediate.
The serious pitch instability that hampered Flyers I and II was significantly
reduced, so repeated minor crashes were eliminated. Flights with the redesigned
Flyer III started lasting over 10 minutes, then 20, then 30. Flyer III became
the first practical aircraft (though without wheels and needing a launching
device), flying consistently under full control and bringing its pilot back to
the starting point safely and landing without damage. On 5 October 1905, Wilbur
flew in 39 minutes 23 seconds." According to the April 1907 issue of the
"Scientific American" magazine, the Wright brothers seemed to have the most
advanced knowledge of heavier-than-air navigation at the time. However, the
same magazine issue also claimed that no public flight had been made in the
United States before its April 1907 issue. Hence, they devised the Scientific
American Aeronautic Trophy in order to encourage the development of a heavier-
than-air flying machine. Alberto Santos-Dumont. The Brazilian inventor Alberto
Santos-Dumont made a public flight with the flying machine designated 14-bis
also known as Oiseau de proie (French for "bird of prey"), on 13 September 1906
in Paris (three years after the Wright Brothers flight in 1903). He used a
canard elevator and pronounced wing dihedral, and covered a distance of 60¬ m
(200¬ ft) on the grounds of the Chateau de Bagatelle in Paris' Bois de
Boulogne, before a large crowd of witnesses. This well-documented event was the
first flight verified by the A√©ro-Club de France of a powered heavier-than-air
machine in Europe and won the Deutsch-Archdeacon Price for the first officially
observed flight further than 25¬ meters. On November 12, 1906, Santos-Dumont
set the first world record recognized by the Federation Aeronautique
Internationale by flying 220¬ meters in 21.5¬ seconds. Santos-Dumont made other
contributions to the field of aircraft design. He added movable surfaces, the
precursor to ailerons, between the wings in an effort to gain more lateral
stability. Santos-Dumont's final design was the Demoiselle monoplane (Nos. 19
to 22). This aircraft was employed as Dumont's personal transportation and he
willingly let others make use of his design. In 1908 Santos-Dumont started
working with Adolphe Cl√©ment's Clement-Bayard company to build the "Demoiselle
No 19". It was the world's first series production aircraft. By 1909 it was
offered with a choice of 3 engines, Clement 20¬ hp; Wright 4-cyl 30¬ hp
(Clement-Bayard had the license to manufacture Wright engines); and Clement-
Bayard 40¬ hp designed by Pierre Clerget. The Demoiselle achieved 120¬ km/h.
Alberto Santos-Dumont ‚Äì seriously ill, and said to be depressed over his
multiple sclerosis (not confirmed) and the use of aircraft in warfare ‚Äì is
believed to have committed suicide by hanging himself in the city of Guaruj√°
in S√£o Paulo, on July 23, 1932. Helicopter. In 1877, Enrico Forlanini
developed an unmanned helicopter powered by a steam engine. It rose to a height
of 13 meters, where it remained for some 20 seconds, after a vertical take-off
from a park in Milan. The first time a manned helicopter is known to have risen
off the ground was in late September 1907 within France in a "tethered" test
flight, and another French helicopter made the first rotary-winged "free
flight" two months later at Lisenux, France. The first successful rotorcraft of
any type, however, wasn't a true helicopter, but an autogyro invented by
Spanish engineer Juan de la Cierva in 1919. These kind of rotorcraft were
mainly used until the development of modern helicopters, when, for some reason,
they became largely neglected, although the idea has since been resurrected
several times. Since the first practical helicopter was the Focke Achgelis Fw
61 (Germany, 1936), the autogyro's golden age only lasted around 20 years.
Progress before World War I (1914‚Äì1918). Almost as soon as they were
invented, planes were drafted for military service. The first country to use
planes for military purposes was Italy, whose planes made reconnaissance,
bombing and shelling correction military flights during the Italian-Turkish war
(September 1911 ‚Äì October 1912), in Libya. First mission (a reconnaissance)
happened on 23 October 1911. First bombing of enemy columns was the 1st
November 1911. Then Bulgaria followed this example. Its planes attacked and
reconnoitered the Ottoman positions during the First Balkan War 1912‚Äì13. The
first war to see major use of planes in offensive, defensive and reconnaissance
capabilities was World War I. The Allies and Central Powers both used planes
extensively. While the concept of using the aeroplane as a weapon of war was
generally laughed at before World War I, the idea of using it for photography
was one that was not lost on any of the major forces. All of the major forces
in Europe had light aircraft, typically derived from pre-war sporting designs,
attached to their reconnaissance departments. Radiotelephones were also being
explored on airplanes, notably the SCR-68, as communication between pilots and
ground commander grew more and more important. Combat schemes. It was not long
before aircraft were shooting at each other, but the lack of any sort of steady
point for the gun was a problem. The French solved this problem when, in late
1914, Roland Garros attached a fixed machine gun to the front of his plane, but
while Adolphe Pegoud would become known as the first "ace", getting credit for
five victories, before also becoming the first ace to die in action, it was
German Luftstreitkr√§fte Leutnant Kurt Wintgens, who, on July 1, 1915, scored
the very first aerial victory by a purpose-built fighter plane, with a
synchronized machine gun. Aviators were styled as modern day knights, doing
individual combat with their enemies. Several pilots became famous for their
air to air combats, the most well known is Manfred von Richthofen, better known
as the Red Baron, who shot down 80 planes in air to air combat with several
different planes, the most celebrated of which was the Fokker Dr.I. On the
Allied side, Ren√© Paul Fonck is credited with the most all-time victories at
75, even when later wars are considered France, Britain, Germany and Italy were
the leading manufacturers of fighter planes that saw action during the war.
Technology and performance advances in aviation's "Golden Age" (1918‚Äì1939).
The years between World War I and World War II saw great advancements in
aircraft technology. Aeroplanes evolved from low-powered biplanes made from
wood and fabric to sleek, high-powered monoplanes made of aluminum, based
primarily on the founding work of Hugo Junkers during the World War I period
and its adoption by American designer William Bushnell Stout and Soviet
designer Andrei Tupolev. The age of the great rigid airships came and went.
After World War I experienced fighter pilots were eager to show off their new
skills. Many American pilots became barnstormers, flying into small towns
across the country and showing off their flying abilities, as well as taking
paying passengers for rides. Eventually the barnstormers grouped into more
organized displays. Air shows sprang up around the country, with air races,
acrobatic stunts, and feats of air superiority. The air races drove engine and
airframe development‚Äîthe Schneider Trophy, for example, led to a series of
ever faster and sleeker monoplane designs culminating in the Supermarine S.6B.
With pilots competing for cash prizes, there was an incentive to go faster.
Amelia Earhart was perhaps the most famous of those on the barnstorming/air
show circuit. She was also the first female pilot to achieve records such as
crossing of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Other prizes, for distance and
speed records, also drove development forwards. For example on June 14, 1919,
Captain John Alcock and Lieutenant Arthur Brown co-piloted a Vickers Vimy non-
stop from St. John's, Newfoundland to Clifden, Ireland, winning the ¬£13,000
($65,000) Northcliffe prize. Eight years later Charles Lindbergh took the
Orteig Prize of $25,000 for the first "solo" non-stop crossing of the Atlantic.
Months after Lindbergh, Paul Redfern was the first to solo the Caribbean Sea
and was last seen flying over Venezuela. Australian Charles Kingsford Smith was
the first to fly across the larger Pacific Ocean in the Southern Cross. His
crew left Oakland, California to make the first trans-Pacific flight to
Australia in three stages. The first (from Oakland to Hawaii) was 2,400 miles,
took 27 hours 25 minutes and was uneventful. They then flew to Suva, Fiji 3,100
miles away, taking 34 hours 30 minutes. This was the toughest part of the
journey as they flew through a massive lightning storm near the equator. They
then flew on to Brisbane in 20 hours, where they landed on 9 June 1928 after
approximately 7,400 miles total flight. On arrival, Kingsford Smith was met by
a huge crowd of 25,000 at Eagle Farm Airport in his hometown of Brisbane.
Accompanying him were Australian aviator Charles Ulm as the relief pilot, and
the Americans James Warner and Captain Harry Lyon (who were the radio operator,
navigator and engineer). A week after they landed, Kingsford Smith and Ulm
recorded a disc for Columbia talking about their trip. With Ulm, Kingsford
Smith later continued his journey being the first in 1929 to circumnavigate the
world, crossing the equator twice. The first lighter-than-air crossings of the
Atlantic were made by airship in July 1919 by His Majesty's Airship R34 and
crew when they flew from East Lothian, Scotland to Long Island, New York and
then back to Pulham, England. By 1929, airship technology had advanced to the
point that the first round-the-world flight was completed by the "Graf
Zeppelin" in September and in October, the same aircraft inaugurated the first
commercial transatlantic service. However the age of the dirigible ended
following the destruction by fire of the zeppelin "Hindenburg" just before
landing at Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937, killing 35 of the 97 people
aboard. Previous spectacular airship accidents, from the "Wingfoot Express"
disaster (1919) to the loss of the R101 (1930), the "Akron" (1933) and the
"Macon" (1935) had already cast doubt on airship safety; following the
destruction of the Hindenburg, the remaining airship making international
flights, the "Graf Zeppelin" was retired (June 1937). Its replacement, the
dirigible "Graf Zeppelin II", made a number of flights, primarily over Germany,
from 1938 to 1939, but was grounded when Germany began World War II. Both
remaining German zeppelins were scrapped in 1940 to supply metal for the German
Luftwaffe; the last American airship, the "Los Angeles", which had not flown
since 1932, was dismantled in late 1939. Meanwhile in Germany, which was
restricted by the Treaty of Versailles in its development of powered aircraft,
instead developed gliding as a sport, especially at the Wasserkuppe, during the
1920s. In its various forms, this activity now has over 400,000 participants.
In 1929 Jimmy Doolittle developed instrument flight. 1929 also saw the first
flight of by far the largest plane ever built until then: the Dornier Do X with
a wing span of 48 m. On its 70th test flight on October 21 there were 169
people on board, a record that was not broken for 20 years. Less than a decade
after the development of the first practical rotorcraft of any type with the
autogyro, in the Soviet Union, Boris N. Yuriev and Alexei M. Cheremukhin, two
aeronautical engineers working at the "Tsentralniy Aerogidrodinamicheskiy
Institut" (TsAGI, , ), constructed and flew the TsAGI 1-EA single rotor
helicopter, which used an open tubing framework, a four blade main rotor, and
twin sets of 1.8-meter (6-foot) diameter anti-torque rotors; one set of two at
the nose and one set of two at the tail. Powered by two M-2 powerplants, up-
rated copies of the Gnome Monosoupape rotary radial engine of World War I, the
TsAGI 1-EA made several successful low altitude flights. By 14 August 1932,
Cheremukhin managed to get the 1-EA up to an unofficial altitude of 605 meters
(1,985¬ ft) with what is likely to be the first successful single-lift rotor
helicopter design ever tested and flown. Only five years after the German
Dornier Do-X had flow, Tupolev designed the largest aircraft of the 1930s era,
the "Maksim Gorky" in the Soviet Union by 1934, as the largest aircraft ever
built using the Junkers methods of metal aircraft construction. In the 1930s
development of the jet engine began in Germany and in Britain - both countries
would go on to develop jet aircraft by the end of World War II. Progress goes
on and massive production, World War II (1939‚Äì1945). World War II saw a
drastic increase in the pace of aircraft development and production. All
countries involved in the war stepped up development and production of aircraft
and flight based weapon delivery systems, such as the first long range bomber.
Also air combat tactics and doctrines changed, large scale strategic bombing
campaigns were launched, fighter escorts introduced and the more flexible
aircraft and weapons allowed precise attacks on small targets with dive
bombers, fighter-bombers, and ground-attack aircraft. New technologies like
radar also allowed more coordinated and controlled deployment of air defense.
The first functional jetplane was the Heinkel He 178 (Germany), flown by Erich
Warsitz in 1939, followed by the world's first operational jet aircraft, the Me
262, in July 1942 and world's first jet-powered bomber, the Arado Ar 234, in
June 1943. British developments, like the Gloster Meteor, followed afterwards,
but saw only brief use in World War II. The first cruise missile (V-1), the
first ballistic missile (V-2), the first (and to date only) operational rocket-
powered combat aircraft Me 163 and the first vertical take-off manned point-
defense interceptor Bachem Ba 349 were also developed by Germany. However, jet
fighters had only limited impact due to their late introduction, fuel
shortages, the lack of experienced pilots and the declining war industry of
Germany. Not only airplanes, but also helicopters saw rapid development in the
Second World War. With the introduction of the Focke Achgelis Fa 223, the
Flettner Fl 282 in 1941 in Germany and the Sikorsky R-4 in 1942 in the USA, for
the first time larger helicopter formations were produced and deployed.
1945‚Äì1991: The Cold War. After World War II, commercial aviation grew
rapidly, using mostly ex-military aircraft to transport people and cargo. This
growth was accelerated by the glut of heavy and super-heavy bomber airframes
like the B-29 and Lancaster that could be converted into commercial aircraft.
The DC-3 also made for easier and longer commercial flights. The first
commercial jet airliner to fly was the British de Havilland Comet. By 1952, the
British state airline BOAC had introduced the Comet into scheduled service.
While a technical achievement, the plane suffered a series of highly public
failures, as the shape of the windows led to cracks due to metal fatigue. The
fatigue was caused by cycles of pressurization and depressurization of the
cabin, and eventually led to catastrophic failure of the plane's fuselage. By
the time the problems were overcome, other jet airliner designs had already
taken to the skies. USSR's Aeroflot became the first airline in the world to
operate sustained regular jet services on September 15, 1956 with the Tupolev
Tu-104. The Boeing 707, which established new levels of comfort, safety and
passenger expectations, ushered in the age of mass commercial air travel,
dubbed the Jet Age. In October 1947 Chuck Yeager took the rocket-powered Bell
X-1 through the sound barrier. Although anecdotal evidence exists that some
fighter pilots may have done so while dive bombing ground targets during the
war, this was the first controlled, level flight to exceed the speed of sound.
Further barriers of distance fell in 1948 and 1952 with the first jet crossing
of the Atlantic and the first nonstop flight to Australia. The 1945 invention
of nuclear bombs briefly increased the strategic importance of military
aircraft in the Cold War between East and West. Even a moderate fleet of long-
range bombers could deliver a deadly blow to the enemy, so great efforts were
made to develop countermeasures. At first, the supersonic interceptor aircraft
were produced in considerable numbers. By 1955 most development efforts shifted
to guided surface-to-air missiles. However, the approach diametrically changed
when a new type of nuclear-carrying platform appeared that could not be stopped
in any feasible way: intercontinental ballistic missiles. The possibility of
these was demonstrated in 1957 with the launch of Sputnik 1 by the Soviet
Union. This action started the Space Race between the nations. In 1961, the sky
was no longer the limit for manned flight, as Yuri Gagarin orbited once around
the planet within 108 minutes, and then used the descent module of Vostok I to
safely reenter the atmosphere and reduce speed from Mach 25 using friction and
converting velocity into heat. The United States responded by launching Alan
Shepard into space on a suborbital flight in a Mercury space capsule. With the
launch of the Alouette I in 1963, Canada became the third country to send a
satellite in space. The space race between the United States and the Soviet
Union would ultimately lead to the landing of men on the moon in 1969. In 1967,
the X-15 set the air speed record for an aircraft at or Mach 6.1 (7,297¬ km/h).
Aside from vehicles designed to fly in outer space, this record was renewed by
X-43 in the 21st century. The Harrier Jump Jet, often referred to as just
"Harrier" or "the Jump Jet", is a British designed military jet aircraft
capable of Vertical/Short Takeoff and Landing (V/STOL) via thrust vectoring. It
first flew in 1969. The same year that Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin set foot
on the moon, and Boeing unveiled the Boeing 747 and the A√©rospatiale-BAC
Concorde supersonic passenger airliner had its maiden flight. The Boeing 747
was the largest commercial passenger aircraft ever to fly, and still carries
millions of passengers each year, though it has been superseded by the Airbus
A380, which is capable of carrying up to 853 passengers. In 1975 Aeroflot
started regular service on the Tu-144‚Äîthe first supersonic passenger plane.
In 1976 British Airways and Air France began supersonic service across the
Atlantic, with Concorde. A few years earlier the SR-71 Blackbird had set the
record for crossing the Atlantic in under 2 hours, and Concorde followed in its
footsteps. The last quarter of the 20th century saw a slowing of the pace of
advancement. No longer was revolutionary progress made in flight speeds,
distances and technology. This part of the century saw the steady improvement
of flight avionics, and a few minor milestones in flight progress. For example,
in 1979 the Gossamer Albatross became the first human powered aircraft to cross
the English channel. This achievement finally saw the realization of centuries
of dreams of human flight. In 1981, the Space Shuttle made its first orbital
flight, proving that a large rocket ship can take off into space, provide a
pressurised life support system for several days, reenter the atmosphere at
orbital speed, precision glide to a runway and land like a plane. In 1986 Dick
Rutan and Jeana Yeager flew an aircraft, the Rutan Voyager, around the world
unrefuelled, and without landing. In 1999 Bertrand Piccard became the first
person to circle the earth in a balloon. Focus was turning to the ultimate
conquest of space and flight at faster than the speed of sound. The ANSARI X
PRIZE inspired entrepreneurs and space enthusiasts to build their own rocket
ships to fly faster than sound and climb into the lower reaches of space.
2001‚Äìpresent. In commercial aviation, the early 21st century saw the end of
an era with the retirement of Concorde. Only commercially viable in niche
markets, the planes were required to fly over the oceans if they wanted to
break the sound barrier. Concorde was fuel hungry and could carry a limited
amount of passengers due to its highly streamlined design. Nevertheless, it
seems to have made a significant operating profit for British Airways. In the
beginning of the 21st century, subsonic military aviation focused on
eliminating the pilot in favor of remotely operated or completely autonomous
vehicles. Several unmanned aerial vehicles or UAVs have been developed. In
April 2001 the unmanned aircraft Global Hawk flew from Edwards AFB in the US to
Australia non-stop and unrefuelled. This is the longest point-to-point flight
ever undertaken by an unmanned aircraft, and took 23 hours and 23 minutes. In
October 2003 the first totally autonomous flight across the Atlantic by a
computer-controlled model aircraft occurred. The "U.S. Centennial of Flight
Commission" was established in 1999 to encourage the broadest national and
international participation in the celebration of 100 years of powered flight.
It publicized and encouraged a number of programs, projects and events intended
to educate people about the history of aviation. Major disruptions to air
travel in the 21st century included the closing of U.S. airspace due to the
September 11 attacks, and the closing of most of European airspace after the
2010 eruption of Eyjafjallaj√∂kull.
