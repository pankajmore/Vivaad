Napoleonic Wars The Napoleonic Wars (1803â€“1815) were a series of wars
declared against Napoleon's French Empire by opposing coalitions. As a
continuation of the wars sparked by the French Revolution of 1789, they
revolutionised European armies and played out on an unprecedented scale, mainly
owing to the application of modern mass conscription. French power rose quickly
as Napoleon's armies conquered much of Europe but collapsed rapidly after
France's disastrous invasion of Russia in 1812. Napoleon's empire ultimately
suffered complete military defeat resulting in the restoration of the Bourbon
monarchy in France. Despite a final victory against Napoleon, five of seven
coalitions saw defeat at the hands of France. France beat the first and second
coalition during the French Revolutionary Wars, and defeated the third (Victory
of Austerlitz), the fourth (Victory de Jena, Eylau, Friedland) and fifth
coalition (Victory of Wagram) under the leadership of Napoleon. These great
victories gave the French Army a sense of invulnerability, especially when they
approached Moscow. But after the retreat from Russia, in spite of incomplete
victories, France was beaten by the sixth coalition at Leipzig and the seventh
coalition at Waterloo. The wars resulted in the dissolution of the Holy Roman
Empire and sowed the seeds of nascent nationalism in Germany and Italy that
would lead to the two nations' respective consolidations later in the century.
Meanwhile, the global Spanish Empire began to unravel as French occupation of
Spain weakened Spain's hold over its colonies, providing an opening for
nationalist revolutions in Spanish America. As a direct result of the
Napoleonic wars, the British Empire became the foremost world power for the
next century, thus beginning "Pax Britannica". No consensus exists as to when
the French Revolutionary Wars ended and the Napoleonic Wars began. An early
candidate is 9 November 1799, when Bonaparte seized power in France with the
coup of "18 Brumaire". 18 May 1803 is the most commonly used date, as this was
when a renewed declaration of war between Britain and France (resulting from
the collapse of the Treaty of Amiens), ended the only period of general peace
in Europe between 1792 and 1814. The Napoleonic Wars ended following Napoleon's
final defeat at Waterloo on 18 June 1815 and the Second Treaty of Paris.
Background 1789â€“1802. The French Revolution of 1789 had a significant impact
throughout Europe, which only increased with the arrest of King Louis XVI of
France in 1792 and his execution in January 1793 for "crimes of tyranny"
against the French people. The first attempt to crush the French Republic came
in 1793 when Austria, the Kingdom of Sardinia, the Kingdom of Naples, Prussia,
Spain and the Kingdom of Great Britain formed the First Coalition. French
measures, including general conscription ("levÃ©e en masse"), military reform,
and total war, contributed to the defeat of the First Coalition, despite the
civil war occurring in France. The war ended when General Napoleon Bonaparte
forced the Austrians to accept his terms in the Treaty of Campo Formio. Only
Great Britain remained diplomatically opposed to the French Republic. The
Second Coalition was formed in 1798 by Austria, Great Britain, the Kingdom of
Naples, the Ottoman Empire, Papal States, Portugal, Russia, Sweden and other
states. During the War of the Second Coalition, the French Republic suffered
from corruption and internal division under the Directory. France also lacked
funds, and no longer had the services of Lazare Carnot, the war minister who
had guided it to successive victories following extensive reforms during the
early 1790s. Bonaparte, the main architect of victory in the last years of the
First Coalition, had gone to campaign in Egypt. Missing two of its most
important military figures from the previous conflict, the Republic suffered
successive defeats against revitalized enemies whom British financial support
brought back into the war. Bonaparte returned from Egypt to France on 23 August
1799, and seized control of the French government on 9 November 1799 in the
coup of 18 Brumaire, replacing the Directory with the Consulate. He reorganized
the French military and created a reserve army positioned to support campaigns
either on the Rhine or in Italy. On all fronts, French advances caught the
Austrians off guard and knocked Russia out of the war. In Italy, Bonaparte won
a notable victory against the Austrians at Marengo in 1800, but the decisive
win came at Hohenlinden later that year. The defeated Austrians left the
conflict after the Treaty of LunÃ©ville (9 February 1801), forcing Britain to
sign the "peace of Amiens" with France. Thus the Second Coalition ended in
another French triumph. However, the United Kingdom remained an important
influence on the continental powers in encouraging their hostility towards
France. London had brought the Second Coalition together through subsidies, and
Bonaparte realized that without either defeating the British or signing a
treaty with them he could not achieve complete peace. Start date and
nomenclature. No consensus exists as to when the French Revolutionary Wars
ended and the Napoleonic Wars began. Possible dates include 9 November 1799,
when Bonaparte seized power in France; 18 May 1803, when Britain and France
ended the only period of peace in Europe between 1792 and 1814, and 2 December
1804, when Bonaparte crowned himself Emperor. Sources in the UK occasionally
refer to the nearly continuous period of warfare from 1792 to 1815 as the Great
French War, or as the final phase of the Anglo-French Second Hundred Years'
War, spanning the period 1689 to 1815. In France, the Napoleonic Wars are
generally associated with the French Revolutionary Wars : "Les guerres de la
RÃ©volution et de l'Empire". War between Britain and France, 1803â€“1814.
Unlike its many coalition partners, Britain remained at war throughout the
period of the Napoleonic Wars. Protected by naval supremacy (in the words of
Admiral Jervis to the House of Lords "I do not say, my Lords, that the French
will not come. I say only they will not come by sea"), the United Kingdom
maintained low-intensity land warfare on a global scale for over a decade. The
British government paid out large sums of money to other European states, so
that they could remain at war with France. These payments are colloquially
known as the Golden Cavalry of St George. The British Army provided long-term
support to the Spanish rebellion in the Peninsular War of 1808â€“1814, assisted
by Spanish guerilla ('little war') tactics. Anglo-Portuguese forces under
Arthur Wellesley campaigned successfully against the French armies, eventually
driving them from Spain and invading southern France. By 1815, the British Army
would play the central role in the final defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo. In
1802, Napoleon victoriously brought to an end the War of the Second Coalition,
with only Great Britain remaining formally at war. Isolated, Britain
reluctantly agreed to end hostilities under the Treaty of Amiens (25 March
1802). Bonaparte tried to exploit the brief peace at sea to restore French
colonial rule in Haiti. The expedition, though initially successful, would soon
turn to a disaster, with the French commander and Bonaparteâ€™s brother-in-law,
Charles Leclerc, dying of yellow fever and almost his entire force destroyed by
the disease combined with the fierce attacks by the rebels. Great Britain
violated the terms of the Treaty of Amiens by occupying Malta and gathered a
Third Coalition against France. The French intervention in the Swiss civil
strife, a breach of the Treaty of LunÃ©ville (1801) between France and the Holy
Roman Empire which guaranteed Swiss sovereignty, was taken as a pretext by the
United Kingdom to break the peace of Amiens and declare war on France on 18 May
1803. The Coalition's war aims changed over the course of the conflict: a
general desire to restore the French monarchy became closely linked to the
struggle to stop Bonaparte. Previous wars had seen France lose most of its
colonial empire. By 1804 Haiti had won its independence, the Louisiana
Territory had been sold to the United States of America, and British naval
superiority threatened any potential for France to establish colonies outside
Europe. Beyond minor naval actions against British imperial interests, the
Napoleonic Wars were much less global in scope than preceding conflicts such as
Seven Years' War which historians would term a "world war". In response to the
naval blockade of the French coasts enacted by the British government on the 16
May 1806, Napoleon issued the Berlin Decree on the 21 November 1806, which
brought into effect the Continental System. This policy aimed to eliminate the
threat from Britain by closing French-controlled territory to its trade.
Britain maintained a standing army of just 220,000 at the height of the
Napoleonic Wars, whereas France's strength peaked at over 2,500,000, as well as
several hundred thousand national guardsmen that Napoleon could draft into the
military if necessary; however, British subsidies paid for a large proportion
of the soldiers deployed by other coalition powers, peaking at about 450,000 in
1813. The Royal Navy effectively disrupted France's extra-continental trade â€”
both by seizing and threatening French shipping and by seizing French colonial
possessions â€” but could do nothing about France's trade with the major
continental economies and posed little threat to French territory in Europe.
Also, France's population and agricultural capacity far outstripped that of
Britain. However, Britain had the greatest industrial capacity in Europe, and
its mastery of the seas allowed it to build up considerable economic strength
through trade. That sufficed to ensure that France could never consolidate its
control over Europe in peace. However, many in the French government believed
that cutting Britain off from the Continent would end its economic influence
over Europe and isolate it. War of the Third Coalition 1805. As Britain was
gathering the Third Coalition against France, Napoleon planned an invasion of
Great Britain, and massed 180,000 effectives at Boulogne. However, in order to
mount his invasion, he needed to achieve naval superiorityâ€”or at least to
pull the British fleet away from the English Channel. A complex plan to
distract the British by threatening their possessions in the West Indies failed
when a Franco-Spanish fleet under Admiral Villeneuve turned back after an
indecisive action off Cape Finisterre on 22 July 1805. The Royal Navy blockaded
Villeneuve in CÃ¡diz until he left for Naples on 19 October; the British
squadron subsequently caught and overwhelmingly defeated his fleet in the
Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October (the British commander, Lord Nelson, died in
the battle). Napoleon would never again have the opportunity to challenge the
British at sea. By this time, however, Napoleon had already all but abandoned
plans to invade Britain, and had again turned his attention to enemies on the
Continent. The French army left Boulogne and moved towards Austria. In April
1805, the United Kingdom and Russia signed a treaty with the aim of removing
the French from the Batavian Republic (roughly present-day Netherlands) and the
Swiss Confederation (Switzerland). Austria joined the alliance after the
annexation of Genoa and the proclamation of Napoleon as King of Italy on 17
March 1805. Sweden, which had already agreed to lease Swedish Pomerania as a
military base for British troops against France, formally entered the coalition
on 9 August. The Austrians began the war by invading Bavaria with an army of
about 70,000 under Karl Mack von Leiberich, and the French army marched out
from Boulogne in late July 1805 to confront them. At Ulm (25 SeptemberÂ â€“ 20
October) Napoleon surrounded Mack's army, forcing its surrender without
significant losses. With the main Austrian army north of the Alps defeated
(another army under Archduke Charles manoeuvred inconclusively against AndrÃ©
MassÃ©na's French army in Italy), Napoleon occupied Vienna. Far from his supply
lines, he faced a larger Austro-Russian army under the command of Mikhail
Kutuzov, with the Emperor Alexander I of Russia personally present. On 2
December, Napoleon crushed the joint Austro-Russian army in Moravia at
Austerlitz (usually considered his greatest victory). He inflicted a total of
25,000 casualties on a numerically superior enemy army while sustaining fewer
than 7,000 in his own force. Austria signed the Treaty of Pressburg (26
December 1805) and left the Coalition. The Treaty required the Austrians to
give up Venetia to the French-dominated Kingdom of Italy and the Tyrol to
Bavaria. With the withdrawal of Austria from the war, stalemate ensued.
Napoleon's army had a record of continuous unbroken victories on land, but the
full force of the Russian army had not yet come into play. War of the Fourth
Coalition 1806â€“1807. Within months of the collapse of the Third Coalition,
the Fourth Coalition (1806â€“07) against France was formed by Prussia, Russia,
Saxony, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. In July 1806, Napoleon formed the
Confederation of the Rhine out of the many tiny German states which constituted
the Rhineland and most other western parts of Germany. He amalgamated many of
the smaller states into larger electorates, duchies and kingdoms to make the
governance of non-Prussian Germany smoother. Napoleon elevated the rulers of
the two largest Confederation states, Saxony and Bavaria, to the status of
kings. In August 1806, the Prussian king, Friedrich Wilhelm III decided to go
to war independently of any other great power except the distant Russia. The
Russian army, an ally of Prussia, was still far away when Prussia declared war.
In September, Napoleon unleashed all the French forces east of the Rhine.
Napoleon himself defeated a Prussian army at Jena (14 October 1806), and Davout
defeated another at AuerstÃ¤dt on the same day. Some 160,000 French soldiers
(increasing in number as the campaign went on) attacked Prussia, moving with
such speed that they destroyed the entire Prussian army as an effective
military force. Out of 250,000 troops the Prussians sustained 25,000
casualties, lost a further 150,000 prisoners 4,000 artillery pieces, and over
100,000 muskets. At Jena, Napoleon had fought only a detachment of the Prussian
force. AuerstÃ¤dt involved a single French corps defeating the bulk of the
Prussian army. Napoleon entered Berlin on 27 October 1806. He visited the tomb
of Frederick the Great and instructed his marshals to remove their hats there,
saying, "If he were alive we wouldn't be here today". In total, Napoleon had
taken only 19 days from beginning his attack on Prussia until knocking it out
of the war with the capture of Berlin and the destruction of its principal
armies at Jena and AuerstÃ¤dt. By contrast, Prussia had fought for three years
in the War of the First Coalition with little achievement. Saxony quit
Prussians and together with small states from north Germany allied with France.
In the next stage of the war the French drove Russian forces out of Poland and
employed many Polish and German soldiers in several sieges in Silesia and
Pomerania. In the latter were used some Italian and Dutch units too. Then
Napoleon turned north to confront the remainder of the Russian army and to try
to capture the temporary Prussian capital at KÃ¶nigsberg. A tactical draw at
Eylau (7â€“8 February 1807), capitulation of Danzig (24 May 1807) and Battle of
Heilsberg (10 June 1807) forced the Russians to withdraw further north.
Napoleon then routed the Russian army at Friedland (14 June 1807). Following
this defeat, Alexander had to make peace with Napoleon at Tilsit (7 July 1807).
In Germany and Poland were instituted new states as like Kingdom of Westphalia,
Duchy of Warsaw and Republic of Danzig. By September, Marshal Brune completed
the occupation of Swedish Pomerania, allowing the Swedish army, however, to
withdraw with all its munitions of war. During 1807, Britain attacked Denmark
and captured its fleet. The large Danish fleet could have greatly aided the
French by replacing many of the ships France had lost at Trafalgar in 1805. The
British attack helped bring Denmark into the war on the side of France. At the
Congress of Erfurt (Septemberâ€“October 1808), Napoleon and Alexander agreed
that Russia should force Sweden to join the Continental System, which led to
the Finnish War of 1808â€“09 and to the division of Sweden into two parts
separated by the Gulf of Bothnia. The eastern part became the Russian Grand
Duchy of Finland. War of the Fifth Coalition 1809. The Fifth Coalition (1809)
of the United Kingdom and Austria against France formed as the UK engaged in
the Peninsular War against France. Again the UK stood alone, and the sea became
the major theatre of war against Napoleon's allies. During the time of the
Fifth Coalition, the Royal Navy won a succession of victories in the French
colonies. On land, the Fifth Coalition attempted few extensive military
endeavours. One, the Walcheren Expedition of 1809, involved a dual effort by
the British Army and the Royal Navy to relieve Austrian forces under intense
French pressure. It ended in disaster after the Army commander, John Pitt, 2nd
Earl of Chatham, failed to capture the objective, the naval base of French-
controlled Antwerp. For the most part of the years of the Fifth Coalition,
British military operations on land apart from in the Iberian Peninsula
remained restricted to hit-and-run operations executed by the Royal Navy, which
dominated the sea after having beaten down almost all substantial naval
opposition from France and its allies and blockading what remained of France's
naval forces in heavily fortified French-controlled ports. These rapid-attack
operations were aimed mostly at destroying blockaded French naval and
mercantile shipping and the disruption of French supplies, communications, and
military units stationed near the coasts. Often, when British allies attempted
military actions within several dozen miles or so of the sea, the Royal Navy
would arrive and would land troops and supplies and aid the Coalition's land
forces in a concerted operation. Royal Navy ships even provided artillery
support against French units when fighting strayed near enough to the
coastline. However, the ability and quality of the land forces governed these
operations. For example, when operating with inexperienced guerrilla forces in
Spain, the Royal Navy sometimes failed to achieve its objectives simply because
of the lack of manpower that the Navy's guerrilla allies had promised to
supply. Economic warfare also continued: the French Continental System against
the British naval blockade of French-controlled territory. Due to military
shortages and lack of organisation in French territory, many breaches of the
Continental System occurred as French-dominated states engaged in illicit
(though often tolerated) trade with British smugglers. Both sides entered
additional conflicts in attempts to enforce their blockade; the British fought
the United States in the War of 1812 (1812â€“15), and the French engaged in the
Peninsular War (1808â€“14). The Iberian conflict began when Portugal continued
trade with the UK despite French restrictions. When Spain failed to maintain
the continental system, the uneasy Spanish alliance with France ended in all
but name. French troops gradually encroached on Spanish territory until they
occupied Madrid, and installed a client monarchy. This provoked an explosion of
popular rebellions across Spain. Heavy British involvement soon followed.
Austria, previously an ally of France, took the opportunity to attempt to
restore its imperial territories in Germany as held prior to Austerlitz.
Austria achieved a number of initial victories against the thinly spread army
of Marshal Berthier. Napoleon had left Berthier with only 170,000 men to defend
France's entire eastern frontier (in the 1790s, 800,000 men had carried out the
same task, but holding a much shorter front). Napoleon had enjoyed easy success
in Spain, retaking Madrid, defeating the Spanish and consequently forcing a
withdrawal of the heavily out-numbered British army from the Iberian Peninsula
(Battle of Corunna, 16 January 1809). But when he left, the guerrilla war
against his forces in the countryside continued to tie down great numbers of
troops. Austria's attack prevented Napoleon from successfully wrapping up
operations against British forces by necessitating his departure for Austria,
and he never returned to the Peninsular theatre. In his absence the French
situation in Spain deteriorated, and then became dire when Sir Arthur Wellesley
arrived to take charge of British-Portuguese forces. The Austrians drove into
the Duchy of Warsaw, but suffered defeat at the Battle of Raszyn on 19 April
1809. The Polish army captured West Galicia following its earlier success.
Napoleon assumed personal command in the east and bolstered the army there for
his counter-attack on Austria. After a few small battles, the well-run campaign
forced the Austrians to withdraw from Bavaria, and Napoleon advanced into
Austria. His hurried attempt to cross the Danube resulted in the massive Battle
of Aspern-Essling (22 May 1809) â€” Napoleon's first significant tactical
defeat. But the Austrian commander, Archduke Charles, failed to follow up on
his indecisive victory, allowing Napoleon to prepare and seize Vienna in early
July. He defeated the Austrians at Wagram, on 5â€“6 July. (It was during the
middle of that battle that Marshal Bernadotte was stripped of his command after
retreating contrary to Napoleon's orders. Shortly thereafter, Bernadotte took
up the offer from Sweden to fill the vacant position of Crown Prince there.
Later he would actively participate in wars against his former Emperor.) The
War of the Fifth Coalition ended with the Treaty of SchÃ¶nbrunn (14 October
1809). In the east, only the Tyrolese rebels led by Andreas Hofer continued to
fight the French-Bavarian army until finally defeated in November 1809, while
in the west the Peninsular War continued. and Napoleon's former enemies,
Prussia and Austria. The Invasion of Russia 1812. The Treaty of Tilsit in 1807
resulted in the Anglo-Russian War (1807â€“12). Emperor Alexander I declared war
on the United Kingdom after the British attack on Denmark in September 1807.
British men-of-war supported the Swedish fleet during the Finnish War and had
victories over the Russians in the Gulf of Finland in July 1808 and August
1809. However, the success of the Russian army on the land forced Sweden to
sign peace treaties with Russia in 1809 and with France in 1810 and to join the
Continental Blockade against Britain. But Franco-Russian relations became
progressively worse after 1810, and the Russian war with the UK effectively
ended. In April 1812, Britain, Russia and Sweden signed secret agreements
directed against Napoleon. In 1812, at the height of his power, Napoleon
invaded Russia with a pan-European "Grande ArmÃ©e", consisting of 650,000 men
(270,000 Frenchmen and many soldiers of allies or subject areas). He aimed to
compel Emperor Alexander I to remain in the Continental System and to remove
the imminent threat of a Russian invasion of Poland. The French forces crossed
the Niemen River on 23 June 1812. Russia proclaimed a Patriotic War, while
Napoleon proclaimed a Second Polish war. The Poles supplied almost 100,000 men
for the invasion-force, but against their expectations, Napoleon avoided any
concessions to Poland, having in mind further negotiations with Russia. The
"Grande ArmÃ©e" marched through Russia, winning a number of relatively minor
engagements and the major Battle of Smolensk on 16â€“18 August. However, in the
same days, a part of the French Army led by Marshal Nicolas Oudinot was stopped
in the Battle of Polotsk by the right wing of the Russian Army, under command
of General Peter Wittgenstein. This prevented the French march on the Russian
capital, Saint Petersburg; the fate of the invasion was to be decided in
Moscow, where Napoleon himself led his forces. Russians used scorched-earth
tactics, and harried the "Grande ArmÃ©e" with light Cossack cavalry. The
"Grande ArmÃ©e" did not adjust its operational methods in response. This
refusal led to most of the losses of the main column of the "Grande ArmÃ©e",
which in one case amounted to 95,000 men, including deserters, in a single
week. At the same time, the main Russian army retreated for almost three
months. This constant retreat led to the unpopularity of Field Marshal Michael
Andreas Barclay de Tolly and a veteran, Prince Mikhail Kutuzov, was made the
new Commander-in-Chief by Tsar Alexander I. Finally, the two armies engaged in
the Battle of Borodino on 7 September, in the vicinity of Moscow. The battle
was the largest and bloodiest single-day action of the Napoleonic Wars,
involving more than 250,000 men and resulting in at least 70,000 casualties.
The French captured the main positions on the battlefield, but failed to
destroy the Russian army; logistical difficulties meant that French losses were
irreplaceable, unlike Russian ones. Napoleon entered Moscow on 14 September,
after the Russian Army retreated yet again. But by then, the Russians had
largely evacuated the city and even released criminals from the prisons to
inconvenience the French; furthermore, the governor, Count Fyodor Rostopchin,
ordered the city to be burnt. Alexander I refused to capitulate, and the peace
talks, attempted by Napoleon, failed. In October, with no sign of clear victory
in sight, Napoleon began the disastrous Great Retreat from Moscow. At the
Battle of Maloyaroslavets the French tried to reach Kaluga, where they could
find food and forage supplies. But the replenished Russian Army blocked the
road, and Napoleon was forced to retreat the same way he had come to Moscow,
through the heavily ravaged areas along the Smolensk road. In the following
weeks, the "Grande ArmÃ©e" was dealt a catastrophic blow by the onset of the
Russian Winter, the lack of supplies and constant guerilla warfare by Russian
peasants and irregular troops. When the remnants of the Napoleon's army crossed
the Berezina River in November, only 27,000 fit soldiers remained, with some
380,000 men dead or missing and 100,000 captured. Napoleon then left his men
and returned to Paris, to prepare the defence against the advancing Russians,
and the campaign effectively ended on 14 December 1812, when the last enemy
troops left Russia. The Russians had lost around 210,000 men, but with their
shorter supply lines, they soon replenished their armies. War of the Sixth
Coalition 1812â€“1814. Seeing an opportunity in Napoleon's historic defeat,
Prussia, Sweden, Austria, and a number of German states re-entered the war.
Napoleon vowed that he would create a new army as large as the one he had sent
into Russia, and quickly built up his forces in the east from 30,000 to 130,000
and eventually to 400,000. Napoleon inflicted 40,000 casualties on the Allies
at LÃ¼tzen (2 May 1813) and Bautzen (20â€“21 May 1813). Both battles involved
total forces of over 250,000, making them some of the largest conflicts of the
wars so far. Meanwhile, in the Peninsular War, Arthur Wellesley renewed the
Anglo-Portuguese advance into Spain just after New Year in 1812, besieging and
capturing the fortified towns of Ciudad Rodrigo, Badajoz, and in the Battle of
Salamanca (which was a damaging defeat to the French). As the French regrouped,
the Angloâ€“Portuguese entered Madrid and advanced towards Burgos, before
retreating all the way to Portugal when renewed French concentrations
threatened to trap them. As a consequence of the Salamanca campaign, the French
were forced to end their long siege of Cadiz and to permanently evacuate the
provinces of Andalusia and Asturias. In a strategic move, Wellesley planned to
move his supply base from Lisbon to Santander. The Angloâ€“Portuguese forces
swept northwards in late May and seized Burgos. On 21 June, at Vitoria, the
combined Anglo-Portuguese and Spanish armies won against Joseph Bonaparte,
finally breaking French power in Spain. The French had to retreat out of the
Iberian peninsula, over the Pyrenees. The belligerents declared an armistice
from 4 June 1813 (continuing until 13 August) during which time both sides
attempted to recover from the loss of approximately a quarter of a million
total men in the preceding two months. During this time Coalition negotiations
finally brought Austria out in open opposition to France. Two principal
Austrian armies took the field, adding an additional 300,000 men to the
Coalition armies in Germany. In total the Allies now had around 800,000 front-
line soldiers in the German theatre, with a strategic reserve of 350,000 formed
to support the frontline operations. Napoleon succeeded in bringing the total
imperial forces in the region to around 650,000â€”although only 250,000 came
under his direct command, with another 120,000 under Nicolas Charles Oudinot
and 30,000 under Davout. The remainder of imperial forces came mostly from the
Confederation of the Rhine, especially Saxony and Bavaria. In addition, to the
south, Murat's Kingdom of Naples and EugÃ¨ne de Beauharnais's Kingdom of Italy
had a total of 100,000 armed men. In Spain, another 150,000 to 200,000 French
troops steadily retreated before Angloâ€“Portuguese forces numbering around
100,000. Thus in total, around 900,000 Frenchmen in all theatres faced around
1,800,000 Coalition soldiers (including the strategic reserve under formation
in Germany). The gross figures may mislead slightly, as most of the German
troops fighting on the side of the French fought at best unreliably and stood
on the verge of defecting to the Allies. One can reasonably say that Napoleon
could count on no more than 450,000 men in Germanyâ€”which left him outnumbered
about four to one. Following the end of the armistice, Napoleon seemed to have
regained the initiative at Dresden (August 1813), where he once again defeated
a numerically superior Coalition army and inflicted enormous casualties, while
sustaining relatively few. However, the failures of his marshals and a slow
resumption of the offensive on his part cost him any advantage that this
victory might have secured. At the Battle of Leipzig in Saxony (16â€“19 October
1813), also called the "Battle of the Nations", 191,000 French fought more than
300,000 Allies, and the defeated French had to retreat into France. Napoleon
then fought a series of battles, including the Battle of Arcis-sur-Aube, in
France itself, but the overwhelming numbers of the Allies steadily forced him
back. His remaining ally Denmark-Norway became isolated and fell to the
coalition. The Allies entered Paris on 30 March 1814. During this time Napoleon
fought his Six Days Campaign, in which he won multiple battles against the
enemy forces advancing towards Paris. However, during this entire campaign he
never managed to field more than 70,000 men against more than half a million
Coalition soldiers. At the Treaty of Chaumont (9 March 1814), the Allies agreed
to preserve the Coalition until Napoleon's total defeat. Napoleon determined to
fight on, even now, incapable of fathoming his massive fall from power. During
the campaign he had issued a decree for 900,000 fresh conscripts, but only a
fraction of these ever materialized, and Napoleon's schemes for victory
eventually gave way to the reality of the hopeless situation. Napoleon
abdicated on 6 April. However, occasional military actions continued in Italy,
Spain, and Holland throughout the spring of 1814. The victors exiled Napoleon
to the island of Elba, and restored the French Bourbon monarchy in the person
of Louis XVIII. They signed the Treaty of Fontainebleau (11 April 1814) and
initiated the Congress of Vienna to redraw the map of Europe. Gunboat War
1807â€“1814. Initially, Denmark-Norway declared itself neutral in the
Napoleonic Wars, established a navy, and traded with both sides. But the
British attacked and captured or destroyed large portions of the Dano-Norwegian
fleet in the First Battle of Copenhagen (2 April 1801), and again in the Second
Battle of Copenhagen (Augustâ€“September 1807). This ended Dano-Norwegian
neutrality, beginning an engagement in a naval guerrilla war in which small
gunboats would attack larger British ships in Danish and Norwegian waters. The
Gunboat War effectively ended with a British victory at the Battle of LyngÃ¸r
in 1812, involving the destruction of the last large Dano-Norwegian shipâ€”the
frigate "Najaden". War of 1812. Coinciding with the War of the Sixth Coalition,
though technically not considered part of the Napoleonic Wars but directly
influenced and driven by it, the otherwise neutral United States declared war
on the United Kingdom and attempted to invade British North America (present
day Canada). The war ended in the "status quo ante bellum" under the Treaty of
Ghent, signed on 24 December 1814, though sporadic fighting continued for
several months (most notably, the Battle of New Orleans). Apart from the
seizing of then-Spanish Mobile by the United States, there was negligible
involvement from other participants of the broader Napoleonic War. Notably, a
series of British raids, later called the Burning of Washington, would result
in the burning of the White House, the Capitol, the Navy Yard, and other public
buildings. The main effect of the War of 1812 on the wider Napoleonic Wars was
to force Britain to divert troops, supplies and funds to defend Canada. War of
the Seventh Coalition 1815. "See also Hundred Days and the Neapolitan War
between the Kingdom of Naples and the Austrian Empire". The Seventh Coalition
(1815) pitted the United Kingdom, Russia, Prussia, Sweden, Austria, the
Netherlands and a number of German states against France. The period known as
the Hundred Days began after Napoleon escaped from Elba and landed at Cannes (1
March 1815). Travelling to Paris, picking up support as he went, he eventually
overthrew the restored Louis XVIII. The Allies rapidly gathered their armies to
meet him again. Napoleon raised 280,000 men, whom he distributed among several
armies. To add to the 90,000-strong standing army, he recalled well over a
quarter of a million veterans from past campaigns and issued a decree for the
eventual draft of around 2.5Â million new men into the French army. This faced
an initial Coalition force of about 700,000â€”although Coalition campaign-plans
provided for one million front-line soldiers, supported by around 200,000
garrison, logistics and other auxiliary personnel. The Coalition intended this
force to have overwhelming numbers against the numerically inferior imperial
French armyâ€”which in fact never came close to reaching Napoleon's goal of
more than 2.5Â million under arms. Napoleon took about 124,000 men of the Army
of the North on a pre-emptive strike against the Allies in Belgium. He intended
to attack the Coalition armies before they combined, in hope of driving the
British into the sea and the Prussians out of the war. His march to the
frontier achieved the surprise he had planned, catching the Anglo-Dutch Army in
a dispersed arrangement. The Prussians had been more wary, concentrating 3/4 of
their Army in and around Ligny. The Prussians forced the ArmÃ©e du Nord to
fight all the day of the 15th to reach Ligny in a delaying action by the
Prussian 1st Corps. He forced Prussia to fight at Ligny on 16 June 1815, and
the defeated Prussians retreated in some disorder. On the same day, the left
wing of the ArmÃ©e du Nord, under the command of Marshal Michel Ney, succeeded
in stopping any of Wellington's forces going to aid BlÃ¼cher's Prussians by
fighting a blocking action at Quatre Bras. Ney failed to clear the cross-roads
and Wellington reinforced the position. But with the Prussian retreat,
Wellington too had to retreat. He fell back to a previously reconnoitred
position on an escarpment at Mont St Jean, a few miles south of the village of
Waterloo. Napoleon took the reserve of the Army of the North, and reunited his
forces with those of Ney to pursue Wellington's army, after he ordered Marshal
Grouchy to take the right wing of the Army of the North and stop the Prussians
re-grouping. In the first of a series of miscalculations, both Grouchy and
Napoleon failed to realize that the Prussian forces were already reorganized
and were assembling at the village of Wavre. In any event the French army did
nothing to stop a rather leisurely retreat that took place throughout the night
and into the early morning by the Prussians. As the 4th, 1st, and 2nd Prussian
Corps marched through the town towards the Battlefield of Waterloo the 3rd
Prussian Corps took up blocking positions across the river, and although
Grouchy engaged and defeated the Prussian rearguard under the command of Lt-Gen
von Thielmann in the Battle of Wavre (18â€“19 June) it was 12 hours too late.
In the end, 17,000 Prussians had kept 33,000 badly needed French reinforcements
off the field. Napoleon delayed the start of fighting at the Battle of Waterloo
on the morning of 18 June for several hours while he waited for the ground to
dry after the previous night's rain. By late afternoon, the French army had not
succeeded in driving Wellington's forces from the escarpment on which they
stood. When the Prussians arrived and attacked the French right flank in ever-
increasing numbers, Napoleon's strategy of keeping the Coalition armies divided
had failed and a combined Coalition general advance drove his army from the
field in confusion. Grouchy organized a successful and well-ordered retreat
towards Paris, where Marshal Davout had 117,000 men ready to turn back the
116,000 men of BlÃ¼cher and Wellington. Militarily, it appeared quite possible
that the French could defeat Wellington and BlÃ¼cher, but politics proved the
source of the Emperor's downfall. In any event Davout was defeated at Issy and
negotiations for surrender had begun. On arriving at Paris three days after
Waterloo, Napoleon still clung to the hope of a concerted national resistance;
but the temper of the legislative chambers, and of the public generally, did
not favour his view. The politicians forced Napoleon to abdicate again on 22
June 1815. Despite the Emperorâ€™s abdication, irregular warfare continued
along the eastern borders and on the outskirts of Paris until the signing of a
cease-fire on 4 July. On 15 July, Napoleon surrendered himself to the British
squadron at Rochefort. The Allies exiled him to the remote South Atlantic
island of Saint Helena, where he died on 5 May 1821. Meanwhile in Italy,
Joachim Murat, whom the Allies had allowed to remain King of Naples after
Napoleon's initial defeat, once again allied with his brother-in-law,
triggering the Neapolitan War (March to May, 1815). Hoping to find support
among Italian nationalists fearing the increasing influence of the Habsburgs in
Italy, Murat issued the Rimini Proclamation inciting them to war. But the
proclamation failed and the Austrians soon crushed Murat at the Battle of
Tolentino (2 May to 3 May 1815), forcing him to flee. The Bourbons returned to
the throne of Naples on 20 May 1815. Murat tried to regain his throne, but
after that failed, a firing squad executed him on 13 October 1815. Political
effects. The Napoleonic Wars brought great changes both to Europe and the
Americas. Napoleon had succeeded in bringing most of Western Europe under one
ruleâ€”a feat that had not been accomplished since the days of the Roman Empire
(although Charlemagne had nearly done so around 800 CE). However, France's
constant warfare with the combined forces of the other major powers of Europe
for over two decades finally took its toll. By the end of the Napoleonic Wars,
France no longer held the role of the dominant power in Europe, as it had since
the times of Louis XIV. In its place, the United Kingdom emerged as by far the
most powerful country in the world and the Royal Navy gained unquestioned naval
superiority across the globe. This, coupled with Britain's large and powerful
industrial economy, made it perhaps the first truly global superpower and
ushered in the "Pax Britannica" that lasted for the next 100 years. In most
European countries, subjugation in the French Empire bought with it many
products of the French Revolution including democracy, due process in courts,
abolition of privileges, etc. The increasing prosperity of the middle classes
with rising commerce and industry meant that restored European monarchs found
it difficult to restore pre-revolutionary absolutism, and had to retain many of
the reforms enacted during Napoleon's rule. Institutional legacies remain to
this day in the form of civil-law legal systems, with clearly redacted codes
compiling their basic lawsâ€”an enduring legacy of the Napoleonic Code.
Societal legacies are showcased in the way many institutions responded to the
people left destitute because of the wars, some of the oldest homeless shelters
in London were a direct response to this, such as The Society for the Relief of
the Homeless Poor. During the wake of the Napoleonic period, nationalism, a
relatively new movement, became increasingly significant. This would shape much
of the course future European history. Its growth spelled the beginning of some
states and the end of others, as the map of Europe changed dramatically in the
hundred years following the Napoleonic Era. Rule by fiefdoms and aristocracy
was widely replaced by national ideologies based on shared origins and culture.
Importantly, Bonaparte's reign over Europe sowed the seeds for the founding of
the nation-states of Germany and Italy by starting the process of consolidating
city-states, kingdoms and principalities. The Napoleonic wars also played a key
role in the independence of the American colonies from their European
motherlands. The conflict significantly weakened the authority and military
power of the Spanish Empire, especially after the Battle of Trafalgar, which
seriously hampered the contact of Spain with its American possessions. Evidence
of this are the many uprisings in Spanish America after the end of the war,
which eventually led to the wars of independence. In Portuguese America, Brazil
experienced greater autonomy as it now served as seat of the Portuguese Empire
and ascended politically to the status of Kingdom. These events also
contributed to the Portuguese Liberal Revolution in 1820 and the Independence
of Brazil in 1822. Afterwards, in order to prevent another such war, Europe was
divided into states according to the balance of power theory. This meant that,
in theory, no European state would become strong enough to dominate Europe in
the future. Another concept emerged â€“ that of a unified Europe. After his
defeat, Napoleon deplored the fact that his dream of a free and peaceful
"European association" remained unaccomplished. Such a European association
would share the same principles of government, system of measurement, currency
and Civil Code. Some one-and-a-half centuries later, and after another major
conflagration (the Second World War), several of these ideals re-emerged in the
form of the European Union. Military legacy. The Napoleonic Wars also had a
profound military impact. Until the time of Napoleon, European states employed
relatively small armies, made up of both national soldiers and mercenaries.
However, military innovators in the mid-18th century began to recognize the
potential of an entire nation at war: a "nation in arms". France, with one of
the largest populations in Europe by the end of the 18th century (27Â million,
as compared to the United Kingdom's 12 million and Russia's 35 to 40Â million),
seemed well poised to take advantage of the "levÃ©e en masse". Because the
French Revolution and Napoleon's reign witnessed the first application of the
lessons of the 18th century's wars on trade and dynastic disputes, commentators
often falsely assume that such ideas arose from the revolution rather than
found their implementation in it. But not all the credit for the innovations of
this period go to Napoleon. Lazare Carnot played a large part in the
reorganization of the French army from 1793 to 1794â€”a time which saw previous
French misfortunes reversed, with Republican armies advancing on all fronts.
The sizes of the armies involved give an obvious indication of the changes in
warfare. During Europe's major pre-revolutionary war, the Seven Years' War of
1756â€“1763, few armies ever numbered more than 200,000. By contrast, the
French army peaked in size in the 1790s with 1.5Â million Frenchmen enlisted.
In total, about 2.8Â million Frenchmen fought on land and about 150,000 at sea,
bringing the total for France to almost 3 million combatants. The UK had
747,670 men under arms between 1792 and 1815. The British Army expanded from
40,000 men in 1793 to a peak of 250,000 men in 1813. Over 250,000 personnel
served in the Royal Navy. In September 1812, Russia had about 904,000 enlisted
men in its land forces, and between 1799 and 1815 a total of 2.1Â million men
served in the Russian army, with perhaps 400,000 serving from 1792 to 1799. A
further 200,000 or so served in the Russian Navy from 1792 to 1815. There are
no consistent statistics for other major combatants. Austria's forces peaked at
about 576,000 and had little or no naval component. Apart from the UK, Austria
proved the most persistent enemy of France, more than a million Austrians
served in total. Prussia never had more than 320,000 men under arms at any
time. Spain's armies also peaked at around 300,000 men, not including a
considerable force of guerrillas. The United States had over 510,000
combatants. Otherwise only the Maratha Confederation, the Ottoman Empire,
Italy, Naples and the Duchy of Warsaw ever had more than 100,000 men under
arms. Even small nations now had armies rivalling the size of the Great Powers'
forces of past wars. However, one should bear in mind that the above numbers of
soldiers come from military records and in practice the actual numbers of
fighting men would fall below this level due to desertion, fraud by officers
claiming non-existent soldiers' pay, death and, in some countries, deliberate
exaggeration to ensure that forces met enlistment-targets. Despite this, the
size of armed forces expanded at this time. The initial stages of the
Industrial Revolution had much to do with larger military forcesâ€”it became
easy to mass-produce weapons and thus to equip significantly larger forces. The
UK served as the largest single manufacturer of armaments in this period,
supplying most of the weapons used by the Coalition powers throughout the
conflicts (although using relatively few itself). France produced the second-
largest total of armaments, equipping its own huge forces as well as those of
the Confederation of the Rhine and other allies. Napoleon himself showed
innovative tendencies in his use of mobility to offset numerical disadvantages,
as brilliantly demonstrated in the rout of the Austro-Russian forces in 1805 in
the Battle of Austerlitz. The French Army reorganized the role of artillery,
forming independent, mobile units, as opposed to the previous tradition of
attaching artillery pieces in support of troops. Napoleon standardized
cannonball sizes to ensure easier resupply and compatibility among his army's
artillery pieces. Another advance affected warfare: the semaphore system had
allowed the French War-Minister, Carnot, to communicate with French forces on
the frontiers throughout the 1790s. The French continued to use this system
throughout the Napoleonic wars. Additionally, aerial surveillance came into use
for the first time when the French used a hot-air balloon to survey Coalition
positions before the Battle of Fleurus, on 26 June 1794. Advances in ordnance
and rocketry also occurred in the course of the conflict.
