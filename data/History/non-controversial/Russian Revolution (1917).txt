Russian Revolution The Russian Revolution is the collective term for a series
of revolutions in Russia in 1917, which destroyed the Tsarist autocracy and led
to the creation of the Soviet Union. The Tsar was deposed and replaced by a
provisional government in the first revolution of February 1917 (March in the
Gregorian calendar; the older Julian calendar was in use in Russia at the
time). In the second revolution, during October, the Provisional Government was
removed and replaced with a Bolshevik (Communist) government. The February
Revolution (March 1917) was a revolution focused around Petrograd (now St.
Petersburg). In the chaos, members of the Imperial parliament or Duma assumed
control of the country, forming the Russian Provisional Government. The army
leadership felt they did not have the means to suppress the revolution and
Nicholas II, the last Tsar of Russia, abdicated. The Soviets (workers'
councils), which were led by more radical socialist factions, initially
permitted the Provisional Government to rule, but insisted on a prerogative to
influence the government and control various militias. The February Revolution
took place in the context of heavy military setbacks during the First World War
(1914â€“18), which left much of the Russian army in a state of mutiny. A period
of dual power ensued, during which the Provisional Government held state power
while the national network of Soviets, led by socialists, had the allegiance of
the lower classes and the political left. During this chaotic period there were
frequent mutinies, protests and many strikes. When the Provisional Government
chose to continue fighting the war with Germany, the Bolsheviks and other
socialist factions campaigned for stopping the conflict. The Bolsheviks turned
workers militias under their control into the Red Guards (later the Red Army)
over which they exerted substantial control. In the October Revolution
(November in the Gregorian calendar), the Bolshevik party, led by Vladimir
Lenin, and the workers' Soviets, overthrew the Provisional Government in St
Petersburg. The Bolsheviks appointed themselves as leaders of various
government ministries and seized control of the countryside, establishing the
Cheka to quash dissent. To end Russiaâ€™s participation in the First World War,
the Bolshevik leaders signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with Germany in March
1918. Civil war erupted between the "Red" (Bolshevik), and "White" (anti-
Bolshevik) factions, which was to continue for several years, with the
Bolsheviks ultimately victorious. In this way, the Revolution paved the way for
the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). While many notable historical
events occurred in Moscow and St. Petersburg, there was also a visible movement
in cities throughout the state, among national minorities throughout the empire
and in the rural areas, where peasants took over and redistributed land.
Background. The Russian Revolution of 1905 was said to be a major factor to the
February Revolutions of 1917. The events of Bloody Sunday triggered a line of
protests. A council of workers called the St. Petersburg Soviet was created in
all this chaos, and the beginning of a communist political protest had begun.
World War I prompted a Russian outcry directed at Tsar Nicholas II. It was
another major factor contributing to the retaliation of the Russian Communists
against their royal opponents. After the entry of Ottoman Empire on the side of
the Central Powers in October 1914, Russia was deprived of a major trade route
through Ottoman Empire, which followed with a minor economic crisis, in which
Russia became incapable of providing munitions to their army in the years
leading to 1917. However, the problems were merely administrative, and not
industrial as Germany was producing great amounts of munitions whilst
constantly fighting on two major battlefronts. The war also developed a
weariness in the city, owing to a lack of food in response to the disruption of
agriculture. Food had become a considerable problem in Russia, but the cause of
this did not lie in any failure of the harvests, which had not been
significantly altered during war-time. The indirect reason was that the
government, in order to finance the war, had been printing off millions of
rouble notes, and by 1917 inflation had made prices increase up to four times
what they had been in 1914. The peasantry were consequently faced with the
higher cost of purchases, but made no corresponding gain in the sale of their
own produce, since this was largely taken by the middlemen on whom they
depended. As a result they tended to hoard their grain and to revert to
subsistence farming. Thus the cities were constantly short of food. At the same
time rising prices led to demands for higher wages in the factories, and in
January and February 1916 revolutionary propaganda, aided by German funds, lead
to widespread strikes. The outcome of all this, however, was a growing
criticism of the government rather than any war-weariness. The original fever
of patriotic excitement, which had caused the name of St. Petersburg to be
changed to the less German sounding Petrograd, may have subsided a little in
the subsequent years, but it had not turned to defeatism and during the initial
risings in Petrograd in February 1917, the crowds in the streets clearly
objected to the banners proclaiming "down with the war]]". Heavy losses during
the war also strengthened thoughts that Tsar Nicholas II was unfit to rule. The
Liberals were now better placed to voice their complaints, since they were
participating more fully through a variety of voluntary organizations. Local
industrial committees proliferated. In July 1915, a Central War Industries
Committee, established under the chairmanship of a prominent Octobrist Guchkov,
included ten workers' representatives- in which the Petrograd Mensheviks agreed
to join despite the objections of their leaders abroad. All this activity gave
renewed encouragement to political ambitions and in September 1915 a
combination of Octobrists and Kadets in the Duma demanded the forming of a
responsible government. The Tsar rejected these proposals. He had now taken
over the position of commander-in-chief of the armed forces and during his
absence at his headquarters at Mogilev, he had left most of the day-to-day
government in the hands of the Empress who was intensely unpopular, owing to
her German origin and the influence that Rasputin, an unsavoury monk, was
thought to exercise over her. All these factors had given rise to a sharp loss
of confidence in the regime by 1916. Early in that year, Guchkov had been
taking soundings among senior army officers and members of the Central War
Industries Committee about a possible coup to force the abdication of the Tsar.
In November, Pavel Milyukov in the Duma openly accused the government of
contemplating peace negotiations with Germany. In December, a small group of
nobles assassinated Rasputin and in January 1917 the Tsar's uncle, Grand Duke
Nicholas, was asked indirectly by Prince Lvov whether he would be prepared to
take over the throne from his nephew, Tsar Nicholas II. None of these incidents
were in themselves the immediate cause of the February Revolution, but they do
help to explain why the monarchy survived only a few days after it had broken
out. Meanwhile, the Social Democrat leaders in exile, now mostly in
Switzerland, had been the glum spectators of the collapse of international
socialist solidarity. French and German Social Democrats had voted in favour of
their respective governments. Georgi Plekhanov in Paris had adopted a violently
anti-German stand, while Helphand supported the German war effort as the best
means of ensuring a revolution in Russia. The Mensheviks largely maintained
that Russia had the right to defend herself against Germany, although Martov (a
prominent Menshevik), now on the left of his group, demanded an end to the war
and a settlement on the basis of national self-determination, with no
annexations or indemnities. It was these views of Martov that predominated in a
manifesto drawn up by Leon Trotsky (a major Bolshevik revolutionary) at a
conference in Zimmerwald, attended by thirty-five Socialist leaders in
September 1915. Inevitably Vladimir Lenin, supported by Zinoviev and Radek,
strongly contested them. Their attitudes became known as the Zimmerwald Left.
Lenin rejected both the defence of Russia and the cry for peace. Since the
autumn of 1914, he had insisted that "from the standpoint of the working class
and of the labouring masses from the lesser evil would be the defeat of the
Tsarist Monarchy"; the war must be turned into a civil war of the proletarian
soldiers against their own governments, and if a proletarian victory should
emerge from this in Russia, then their duty would be to wage a revolutionary
war for the liberation of the masses throughout Europe. Thus, Lenin remained
the enfant terrible of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, although at
this point in the war his following in Russia was as few as 10,000 and he must
have seemed no more than the leader of an extremist wing of a bankrupt
organization. Lenin, however, then executed the protests of Petrograd which set
off the 1917 Russian Revolution. Economic and social changes. An elementary
theory of property, believed by many peasants, was that land should belong to
those who work on it. At the same time, peasant life and culture was changing
constantly. Change was facilitated by the physical movement of growing numbers
of peasant villagers who migrated to and from industrial and urban
environments, but also by the introduction of city culture into the village
through material goods, the press, and word of mouth. Workers also had good
reasons for discontent: overcrowded housing with often deplorable sanitary
conditions, long hours at work (on the eve of the war a 10-hour workday six
days a week was the average and many were working 11â€“12 hours a day by 1916),
constant risk of injury and death from very poor safety and sanitary
conditions, harsh discipline (not only rules and fines, but foremenâ€™s fists),
and inadequate wages (made worse after 1914 by steep war-time increases in the
cost of living). At the same time, urban industrial life was full of benefits,
though these could be just as dangerous, from the point of view of social and
political stability, as the hardships. There were many encouragements to expect
more from life. Acquiring new skills gave many workers a sense of self-respect
and confidence, heightening expectations and desires. Living in cities, workers
encountered material goods such as they had never seen while in the village.
Most important, living in cities, they were exposed to new ideas about the
social and political order. The social causes of the Russian Revolution mainly
came from centuries of oppression of the lower classes by the Tsarist regime,
and Nicholas's failures in World War I. While rural agrarian peasants had been
emancipated from serfdom in 1861, they still resented paying redemption
payments to the state, and demanded communal tender of the land they worked.
The problem was further compounded by the failure of Sergei Witte's land
reforms of the early 20th century. Increasing peasant disturbances and
sometimes actual revolts occurred, with the goal of securing ownership of the
land they worked. Russia consisted mainly of poor farming peasants, with 1.5%
of the population owning 25% of the land. The rapid industrialization of Russia
also resulted in urban overcrowding and poor conditions for urban industrial
workers (as mentioned above). Between 1890 and 1910, the population of the
capital, Saint Petersburg, swelled from 1,033,600 to 1,905,600, with Moscow
experiencing similar growth. This created a new 'proletariat' which, due to
being crowded together in the cities, was much more likely to protest and go on
strike than the peasantry had been in previous times. In one 1904 survey, it
was found that an average of sixteen people shared each apartment in Saint
Petersburg, with six people per room. There was also no running water, and
piles of human waste were a threat to the health of the workers. The poor
conditions only aggravated the situation, with the number of strikes and
incidents of public disorder rapidly increasing in the years shortly before
World War I. Because of late industrialization, Russia's workers were highly
concentrated. By 1914 40% of Russian workers were employed in factories of
+1,000 workers (32% in 1901). 42% worked in 100-1,000 worker enterprises, 18%
in 1-100 worker businesses (in the USA, 1914, the figures were 18, 47 and 35
respectively). World War I only added to the chaos. Conscription swept up the
unwilling in all parts of Russia. The vast demand for factory production of war
supplies and workers caused many more labor riots and strikes. Conscription
stripped skilled workers from the cities, who had to be replaced with unskilled
peasants, and then, when famine began to hit due to the poor railway system,
workers abandoned the cities in droves to look for food. Finally, the soldiers
themselves, who suffered from a lack of equipment and protection from the
elements, began to turn against the Tsar. This was mainly because, as the war
progressed, many of the officers who were loyal to the Tsar were killed, and
were replaced by discontented conscripts from the major cities, who had little
loyalty to the Tsar. Political issues. Many sections of the crown had reason to
be dissatisfied with the existing autocracy. Nicholas II was a deeply
conservative ruler and maintained a strict authoritarian system. Individuals
and society in general were expected to show self-restraint, devotion to
community, deference to the social hierarchy and a sense of duty to the
country. Religious faith helped bind all of these tenets together as a source
of comfort and reassurance in the face of difficult conditions and as a means
of political authority exercised through the clergy. Perhaps more than any
other modern monarch, Nicholas II attached his fate and the future of his
dynasty to the notion of the ruler as a saintly and infallible father to his
people. This idealized vision of the Romanov monarchy blinded him to the actual
state of his country. With a firm belief that his power to rule was granted by
Divine Right, Nicholas assumed that the Russian people were devoted to him with
unquestioning loyalty. This ironclad belief rendered Nicholas unwilling to
allow the progressive reforms that might have alleviated the suffering of the
Russian people. Even after the 1905 revolution spurred the Tsar to decree
limited civil rights and democratic representation, he worked to limit even
these liberties in order to preserve the ultimate authority of the crown.
Despite constant oppression, the desire of the people for democratic
participation in government decisions was strong. Since the Age of
Enlightenment, Russian intellectuals had promoted Enlightenment ideals such as
the dignity of the individual and the rectitude of democratic representation.
These ideals were championed most vociferously by Russiaâ€™s liberals, although
populists, Marxists, and anarchists also claimed to support democratic reforms.
A growing opposition movement had begun to challenge the Romanov monarchy
openly well before the turmoil of World War I. Dissatisfaction with Russian
autocracy culminated in the huge national upheaval that followed the Bloody
Sunday massacre of January 1905, in which hundreds of unarmed protesters were
shot by the Tsar's troops. Workers responded to the massacre with a crippling
general strike, forcing Nicholas to put forth the October Manifesto, which
established a democratically elected parliament (the State Duma). The Tsar
undermined this promise of reform but a year later with Article 87 of the 1906
Fundamental State Laws, and subsequently dismissed the first two Dumas when
they proved uncooperative. Unfulfilled hopes of democracy fueled revolutionary
ideas and violent outbursts targeted at the monarchy. One of the Tsarâ€™s
principal rationales for risking war in 1914 was his desire to restore the
prestige that Russia had lost amid the debacles of the Russo-Japanese war.
Nicholas also sought to foster a greater sense of national unity with a war
against a common and ancient enemy. The Russian Empire was an agglomeration of
diverse ethnicities that had shown significant signs of disunity in the years
before the First World War. Nicholas believed in part that the shared peril and
tribulation of a foreign war would mitigate the social unrest over the
persistent issues of poverty, inequality, and inhuman working conditions.
Instead of restoring Russia's political and military standing, World War I led
to the horrifying slaughter of Russian troops and military defeats that
undermined both the monarchy and society in general to the point of collapse.
World War I. The outbreak of war in August 1914 initially served to quiet the
prevalent social and political protests, focusing hostilities against a common
external enemy, but this patriotic unity did not last long. As the war dragged
on inconclusively, war-weariness gradually took its toll. More important,
though, was a deeper fragility: although many ordinary Russians joined anti-
German demonstrations in the first few weeks of the war, the most widespread
reaction appears to have been skepticism and fatalism. Hostility toward the
Kaiser and the desire to defend their land and their lives did not necessarily
translate into enthusiasm for the Tsar or the government. Russia's first major
battle of the war was a disaster: in the 1914 Battle of Tannenberg, over 30,000
Russian troops were killed or wounded and 90,000 captured, while Germany
suffered just 20,000 casualties. However, Austro-Hungarian forces allied to
Germany were driven back deep into the Galicia region by the end of the year.
In the autumn of 1915, Nicholas had taken direct command of the army,
personally overseeing Russia's main theatre of war and leaving his ambitious
but incapable wife Alexandra in charge of the government. Reports of corruption
and incompetence in the Imperial government began to emerge, and the growing
influence of Grigori Rasputin in the Imperial family was widely resented. In
the eyes of Lynch, a revisionist historian who focuses on the role of the
people, Rasputin was a "fatal disease" to the Tsarist regime. In 1915, things
took a critical turn for the worse when Germany shifted its focus of attack to
the Eastern front. The superior German armyÂ â€” better led, better trained and
better suppliedÂ â€” was terrifyingly effective against the ill-equipped
Russian forces, driving the Russians out of Galicia, as well as Russian Poland,
during the Gorliceâ€“TarnÃ³w Offensive campaign. By the end of October 1916,
Russia had lost between 1,600,000 and 1,800,000 soldiers, with an additional
2,000,000 prisoners of war and 1,000,000 missing, all making up a total of
nearly 5,000,000 men. These staggering losses played a definite role in the
mutinies and revolts that began to occur. In 1916, reports of fraternizing with
the enemy started to circulate. Soldiers went hungry, and lacked shoes,
munitions, and even weapons. Rampant discontent lowered morale, which was
further undermined by a series of military defeats. Casualty rates were the
most vivid sign of this disaster. Already, by the end of 1914, only five months
into the war, around 390,000 Russian men had lost their lives and nearly
1,000,000 were injured. Far sooner than expected, barely trained recruits had
to be called up for active duty, a process repeated throughout the war as
staggering losses continued to mount. The officer class also saw remarkable
changes, especially within the lower echelons, which were quickly filled with
soldiers rising up through the ranks. These men, usually of peasant or working-
class backgrounds, were to play a large role in the politicization of the
troops in 1917. The huge losses on the battlefields were not limited to men.
The army quickly ran short of rifles and ammunition (as well as uniforms and
food), and, by mid-1915, men were being sent to the front bearing no arms. It
was hoped that they could equip themselves with the arms that they recovered
from fallen soldiers, of both sides, on the battlefields. With patently good
reason, the soldiers did not feel that they were being treated as human beings,
or even as valuable soldiers, but rather as raw materials to be squandered for
the purposes of the rich and powerful. By the spring of 1915, the army was in
steady retreat, which was not always orderly; desertion, plunder and chaotic
flight were not uncommon. By 1916, however, the situation had improved in many
respects. Russian troops stopped retreating, and there were even some modest
successes in the offensives that were staged that year, albeit at great loss of
life. Also, the problem of shortages was largely solved by a major effort to
increase domestic production. Nevertheless, by the end of 1916, morale among
soldiers was even worse than it had been during the great retreat of 1915. The
fortunes of war may have improved, but the fact of the war, still draining away
strength and lives from the country and its many individuals and families,
remained an oppressive inevitability. The crisis in morale (as was argued by
Allan Wildman, a leading historian of the Russian army in war and revolution)
"was rooted fundamentally in the feeling of utter despair that the slaughter
would ever end and that anything resembling victory could be achieved." The war
devastated not only soldiers. By the end of 1915, there were manifold signs
that the economy was breaking down under the heightened strain of wartime
demand. The main problems were food shortages and rising prices. Inflation
dragged incomes down at an alarmingly rapid rate, and shortages made it
difficult to buy even what one could afford. These shortages were a problem
especially in the capital, St. Petersburg, where distance from supplies and
poor transportation networks made matters particularly bad. Shops closed early
or entirely for lack of bread, sugar, meat and other provisions, and lines
lengthened massively for what remained. It became increasingly difficult both
to afford and actually buy food. Not surprisingly, strikes increased steadily
from the middle of 1915, and so did crime; but, for the most part, people
suffered and endured, scouring the city for food. Working class women in St.
Petersburg reportedly spent about forty hours a week in food lines, begging,
turning to prostitution or crime, tearing down wooden fences to keep stoves
heated for warmth, grumbling about the rich, and wondering when and how this
would all come to an end. Government officials responsible for public order
worried about how long people's patience would last. A report by the St.
Petersburg branch of the security police, the Okhrana, in October 1916, warned
bluntly of "the possibility in the near future of riots by the lower classes of
the empire enraged by the burdens of daily existence." Nicholas was blamed for
all of these crises, and what little support he had left began to crumble. As
discontent grew, the State Duma issued a warning to Nicholas in November 1916.
It stated that, inevitably, a terrible disaster would grip the country unless a
constitutional form of government was put in place. In typical fashion,
however, Nicholas ignored them, and Russia's Tsarist regime collapsed a few
months later during the February Revolution of 1917. One year later, the Tsar
and his entire family were executed. Ultimately, Nicholas's inept handling of
his country and the war destroyed the Tsar and ended up costing him both his
reign and his life. February Revolution. At the beginning of February,
Petrograd workers began several strikes and demonstrations. On , workers at
Putilov, Petrograd's largest industrial plant, announced a strike. The next
day, a series of meetings and rallies were held for International Women's Day,
which gradually turned into economic and political gatherings. Demonstrations
were organised to demand bread, and these were supported by the industrial
working force who considered them a reason for continuing the strikes. The
women workers marched to nearby factories bringing out over 50,000 workers on
strike. By , virtually every industrial enterprise in Petrograd had been shut
down, together with many commercial and service enterprises. Students, white-
collar workers and teachers joined the workers in the streets and at public
meetings. To quell the riots, the Tsar looked to the army. At least 180,000
troops were available in the capital, but most were either untrained or
injured. Historian Ian Beckett suggests around 12,000 could be regarded as
reliable, but even these proved reluctant to move in on the crowd, since it
included so many women. It was for this reason that when, on , the Tsar ordered
the army to suppress the rioting by force, troops began to mutiny. Although few
actively joined the rioting, many officers were either shot or went into
hiding; the ability of the garrison to hold back the protests was all but
nullified, symbols of the Tsarist regime were rapidly torn down around the
city, and governmental authority in the capital collapsed â€“ not helped by the
fact that Nicholas had prorogued the Duma that morning, leaving it with no
legal authority to act. The response of the Duma, urged on by the liberal bloc,
was to establish a Temporary Committee to restore law and order; meanwhile, the
socialist parties establish the Petrograd Soviet to represent workers and
soldiers. The remaining loyal units switched allegiance the next day. The Tsar
took a train back towards Petrograd, which was stopped on , by a group of
disloyal troops. When the Tsar finally reached his destination, the Army Chiefs
and his remaining ministers (those who had not fled under pretense of a power-
cut) suggested in unison that he abdicate the throne. He did so on , on behalf
of himself, and then, having taken advice, on behalf of his son, the Tsarevich.
Nicholas nominated his brother, the Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich, to
succeed him. But the Grand Duke realised that he would have little support as
ruler, so he declined the crown on , stating that he would take it only if that
was the consensus of democratic action. Six days later, Nicholas, no longer
Tsar and addressed with contempt by the sentries as "Nicholas Romanov", was
reunited with his family at the Alexander Palace at Tsarskoye Selo. He was
placed under house arrest with his family by the Provisional Government. The
immediate effect of the February Revolution was a widespread atmosphere of
elation and excitement in Petrograd. On , a provisional government was
announced. The center-left was well represented, and the government was
initially chaired by a liberal aristocrat, Prince Georgy Yevgenievich Lvov, a
member of the Constitutional Democratic party (KD). The socialists had formed
their rival body, the Petrograd Soviet (or workers' council) four days earlier.
The Petrograd Soviet and the Provisional Government competed for power over
Russia. Between February and throughout October: "Dual Power" ("dvoevlastie").
The effective power of the Provisional Government was challenged by the
authority of an institution that claimed to represent the will of workers and
soldiers and could, in fact, mobilize and control these groups during the early
months of the revolutionÂ â€” the Petrograd Soviet of Workers' Deputies. The
model for the soviet were workers' councils that had been established in scores
of Russian cities during the 1905 revolution. In February 1917, striking
workers elected deputies to represent them and socialist activists began
organizing a citywide council to unite these deputies with representatives of
the socialist parties. On 27 February, socialist Duma deputies, mainly
Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries, took the lead in organizing a
citywide council. The Petrograd Soviet met in the Tauride Palace, the same
building where the new government was taking shape. The leaders of the
Petrograd Soviet believed that they represented particular classes of the
population, not the whole nation. They also believed Russia was not ready for
socialism. So they saw their role as limited to pressuring hesitant
"bourgeoisie" to rule and to introduce extensive democratic reforms in Russia
(the replacement of the monarchy by a republic, guaranteed civil rights, a
democratic police and army, abolition of religious and ethnic discrimination,
preparation of elections to a constituent assembly, and so on). They met in the
same building as the emerging Provisional Government not to compete with the
Duma Committee for state power but to best exert pressure on the new
government, to act, in other words, as a popular democratic lobby. The
relationship between these two major powers was complex from the beginning and
would shape the politics of 1917. The representatives of the Provisional
Government agreed to "take into account the opinions of the Soviet of Workers'
Deputies," though they were also determined to prevent "interference in the
actions of the government," which would create "an unacceptable situation of
dual power." In fact, this was precisely what was being created, though this
"dual power" (dvoevlastie) was the result less of the actions or attitudes of
the leaders of these two institutions than of actions outside their control,
especially the ongoing social movement taking place on the streets of
Russiaâ€™s cities, in factories and shops, in barracks and in the trenches, and
in the villages. The political group that proved most troublesome for Kerensky,
and would eventually overthrow him, was the Bolshevik Party, led by Vladimir
Lenin. Lenin had been living in exile in neutral Switzerland and, due to
democratization of politics after the February Revolution, which legalized
formerly banned political parties, he perceived the opportunity for his Marxist
revolution. Although return to Russia had become a possibility, the war made it
logistically difficult. Eventually, German officials arranged for Lenin to pass
through their territory, hoping that his activities would weaken Russia or
evenÂ â€” if the Bolsheviks came to powerÂ â€” lead to Russia's withdrawal from
the war. Lenin and his associates, however, had to agree to travel to Russia in
a sealed train: Germany would not take the chance that he would foment
revolution in Germany. After passing through the front, he arrived in Petrograd
in April 1917. With Lenin's arrival, the popularity of the Bolsheviks increased
steadily. Over the course of the spring, public dissatisfaction with the
Provisional Government and the war, in particular among workers, soldiers and
peasants, pushed these groups to radical parties. Despite growing support for
the Bolsheviks, buoyed by maxims that called most famously for "all power to
the Soviets," the party held very little real power in the moderate dominated
Petrograd Soviet. In fact, historians such as Sheila Fitzpatrick have asserted
that Lenin's exhortations for the Soviet Council to take power were intended to
arouse indignation both with the Provisional Government, whose policies were
viewed as conservative, and the Soviet itself, which was viewed as subservient
to the conservative government. By most historians' accounts, Lenin and his
followers were unprepared for how their groundswell of support, especially
among influential worker and soldier groups, would translate into real power in
the summer of 1917. On 18 June, the Provisional Government launched an attack
against Germany that failed miserably. Soon after, the government ordered
soldiers to go to the front, reneging on a promise. The soldiers refused to
follow the new orders. The arrival of radical Kronstadt sailorsÂ â€” who had
tried and executed many officers, including one admiralÂ â€” further fueled the
growing revolutionary atmosphere. The sailors and soldiers, along with
Petrograd workers, took to the streets in violent protest, calling for "all
power to the Soviets." The revolt, however, was disowned by Lenin and the
Bolshevik leaders and dissipated within a few days. In the aftermath, Lenin
fled to Finland under threat of arrest while Trotsky, among other prominent
Bolsheviks, was arrested. The July Days confirmed the popularity of the anti-
war, radical Bolsheviks, but their unpreparedness at the moment of revolt was
an embarrassing gaffe that lost them support among their main constituent
groups: soldiers and workers. The Bolshevik failure in the July Days proved
temporary. In August, poor or misleading, communication led General Lavr
Kornilov, the recently appointed Supreme Commander of Russian military forces,
to believe that the Petrograd government had been captured by radicals, or was
in serious danger thereof. In response, he ordered troops to Petrograd to
pacify the city. To secure his position, Kerensky had to ask for Bolshevik
assistance. He also sought help from the Petrograd Soviet, which called upon
armed Red Guards to "defend the revolution." This Kornilov Affair failed
largely due to the efforts of the Bolsheviks, whose influence over railroad and
telegraph workers proved vital in stopping the movement of troops. With his
coup failing, Kornilov surrendered and was relieved of his position. The
Bolsheviks' role in stopping the attempted coup immensely strengthened their
position. In early September, the Petrograd Soviet freed all jailed Bolsheviks
and Trotsky became chairman of the Petrograd Soviet. Growing numbers of
socialists and lower class Russians viewed the government less and less as a
force in support of their needs and interests. The Bolsheviks benefited as the
only major organized opposition party that had refused to compromise with the
Provisional Government, and they benefited from growing frustration and even
disgust with other parties, such as the Mensheviks and SRs, who stubbornly
refused to break with the idea of national unity across all classes. In
Finland, Lenin had worked on his book "State and Revolution" and continued to
lead his party writing newspaper articles and policy decrees. By October, he
returned to Petrograd, aware that the increasingly radical city presented him
no legal danger and a second opportunity for revolution. The Bolshevik Central
Committee drafted a resolution, calling for the dissolution of the Provisional
Government in favor of the Petrograd Soviet. The resolution was passed 10â€“2
(Lev Kamenev and Grigory Zinoviev prominently dissenting) and the October
Revolution began. October Revolution. The October Revolution was led by
Vladimir Lenin and was based upon Lenin's writing on the ideas of Karl Marx, a
political ideology often known as Marxism-Leninism. It marked the beginning of
the spread of communism in the 20th century. It was far less sporadic than the
revolution of February and came about as the result of deliberate planning and
coordinated activity to that end. Though Lenin was the leader of the Bolshevik
Party, it has been argued that since Lenin was not present during the actual
takeover of the Winter Palace, it was really Trotsky's organization and
direction that led the revolution, merely spurred by the motivation Lenin
instigated within his party. Critics on the Right have long argued that the
financial and logistical assistance of German intelligence via their key agent,
Alexander Parvus was a key component as well, though historians are divided,
since there is little evidence supporting that claim. On 7 November 1917,
Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin led his leftist revolutionaries in a revolt
against the ineffective Provisional Government (Russia was still using the
Julian Calendar at the time, so period references show a 25 October date). The
October revolution ended the phase of the revolution instigated in February,
replacing Russia's short-lived provisional parliamentary government with
government by soviets, local councils elected by bodies of workers and
peasants. Liberal and monarchist forces, loosely organized into the White Army,
immediately went to war against the Bolsheviks' Red Army, in a series of
battles that would become known as the Russian Civil War. Soviet membership was
initially freely elected, but many members of the Socialist-Revolutionary
Party, anarchists, and other leftists created opposition to the Bolsheviks
through the soviets themselves. When it became clear that the Bolsheviks had
little support outside of the industrialized areas of Saint Petersburg and
Moscow, they simply barred non-Bolsheviks from membership in the soviets. This
obviously caused mass domestic tension with many individuals who called for
another series of political reform, revolting, and calling for "a third Russian
revolution," a movement that received a considerable amount of support. The
most notable instances of this anti-bolshevik mentality were expressed in the
Tambov rebellion, 1919â€“1921, and the Kronstadt rebellion in March 1921. These
movements, which made a wide range of demands and lacked effective
coordination, were eventually defeated along with the White Army during the
Civil War. Civil war. The Russian Civil War, which broke out in 1918 shortly
after the revolution, brought death and suffering to millions of people
regardless of their political orientation. The war was fought mainly between
the Red Army ("Reds"), consisting of the uprising majority led by the Bolshevik
minority, and the "Whites"Â â€” army officers and cossacks, the "bourgeoisie",
and p[olitical groups ranging from the far Right to the Socialist
Revolutionaries who opposed the drastic restructuring championed by the
Bolsheviks following the collapse of the Provisional Government to the soviets
(under clear Bolshevik dominance). The Whites had backing from nations such as
Great Britain, France, USA and Japan, while the Reds sported internal, domestic
support which proved to be much more effective. Though the Allied nations,
using external interference, provided substantial military aid to the loosely
knit anti-Bolshevik forces, they were ultimately defeated. The Bolsheviks
firstly assumed power in Petrograd (modern-day Saint Petersburg), expanding
their rule outwards, eventually reaching the Easterly Siberian Russian coast 4
years after the war in Vladivostok, an occupation that is believed to have
ended all significant military campaigns in the nation. Less than one year
later, the last area controlled by the White Army, the Ayano-Maysky District,
directly to the north of the Krai containing Vladivostok, was given up when
General Anatoly Pepelyayev capitulated in 1923. Several revolts were initiated
purely by the general public against the Bolsheviks and their army near the end
of the war, notably the Kronstadt Rebellion, a naval mutiny engineered by
Soviet Baltic sailors, former Red Army soldiers, and the people of Kronstadt,
an armed uprising against the rightfully antagonized Bolshevik economic
policies subjected to farmers, including forced seizures of grain crops by the
Communists. This all amounted to large-scale discontent. When delegates
representing the Kronstadt sailors arrived at Petrograd for negotiations, they
raised 15 demands primarily pertaining on the Russian right to freedom The
Government firmly denounced the rebellions and labelled the requests as a
reminder of the Social Revolutionaries, a political party that was popular
among Soviets before Lenin, but refused to cooperate with the Bolshevik Army.
The Government then responded with an armed suppression of these revolts,
however suffering 10 thousand mortalities before entering the city of
Kronstadt, ending the rebellions fairly quickly, causing many of the rebels to
flee in political exile. During the Civil War, Nestor Makhno led a Ukrainian
anarchist movement, the Black Army allied to the Bolsheviks thrice, one of the
powers ending the alliance each time. However, a Bolshevik force under Mikhail
Frunze destroyed the Makhnovist movement, when the Makhnovists refused to merge
into the Red Army. In addition, the so-called "Green Army" (peasants defending
their property against the opposing forces) played a secondary role in the war,
mainly in the Ukraine. Death of the imperial family. In early March, the
Provisional Government placed Nicholas and his family under house arrest in the
Alexander Palace at Tsarskoe Selo, south of Petrograd. In August 1917 the
Kerensky government evacuated the Romanovs to Tobolsk in the Urals, allegedly
to protect them from the rising tide of revolution during the Red Terror. After
the Bolsheviks came to power in October 1917, the conditions of their
imprisonment grew stricter and talk of putting Nicholas on trial increased. As
the counter revolutionary White movement gathered force, leading to full-scale
civil war by the summer, the Romanovs were moved during April and May 1918 to
Yekaterinburg, a militant Bolshevik stronghold. During the early morning of
July 16, at approximately 01:30, Nicholas, Alexandra, their children, their
physician, and several servants were taken into the basement and killed.
According to Edvard Radzinsky and Dmitrii Volkogonov, the order came directly
from Vladimir Lenin and Yakov Sverdlov in Moscow. That the order came from the
top has long been believed, although there is a lack of hard evidence. It has
been argued that the execution may have been carried out on the initiative of
local Bolshevik officials, or that it was an option approved in Moscow should
White troops approach Yekaterinburg. Radzinsky noted that Lenin's bodyguard
personally delivered the telegram ordering the execution and that he was
ordered to destroy the evidence. The Russian revolution and the world. Leon
Trotsky said that the goal of socialism in Russia would not be realized without
the success of the world revolution. Indeed, a revolutionary wave caused by the
Russian Revolution lasted until 1923. Despite initial hopes for success in the
German Revolution of 1918â€“1919, in the short-lived Hungarian Soviet Republic
and others like it, no other Marxist movement succeeded in keeping power in its
hands. This issue is subject to conflicting views on the communist history by
various Marxist groups and parties. Joseph Stalin later rejected this idea,
stating that socialism was possible in one country. The confusion regarding
Stalin's position on the issue stems from the fact that he, after Lenin's death
in 1924, successfully used Lenin's argumentÂ â€” the argument that socialism's
success needs the workers of other countries in order to happenÂ â€” to defeat
his competitors within the party by accusing them of betraying Lenin and,
therefore, the ideals of the October Revolution. Chronologies. Chronology of
