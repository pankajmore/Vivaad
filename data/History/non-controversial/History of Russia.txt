History of Russia The history of Russia begins with that of the Eastern Slavs
and the Finno-Ugric peoples. The state of Gar√∞ar√≠ki ( "the realm of towns"),
which was centered in Novgorod and included the entire areas inhabited by Ilmen
Slavs, Veps and Votes, was established by the Varangian chieftain Rurik in 862
(the traditional beginning of Russian history). Kievan Rus', the first united
East Slavic state, was founded by Rurik's successor Oleg of Novgorod in 882.
The state adopted Christianity from the Byzantine Empire in 988, beginning the
synthesis of Byzantine and Slavic cultures that defined Russian culture for the
next millennium. Kievan Rus' ultimately disintegrated as a state because of the
Mongol invasion of Rus' in 1237‚Äì1240. During that time a number of regional
magnates, in particular Novgorod and Pskov, fought to inherit the cultural and
political legacy of Kievan Rus'. After the 13th century, Moscow came to
dominate the former cultural center. By the 18th century, the Tsardom of Russia
had become the huge Russian Empire, stretching from the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian
Commonwealth eastward to the Pacific Ocean. Expansion in the western direction
sharpened Russia's awareness of its separation from much of the rest of Europe
and shattered the isolation in which the initial stages of expansion had
occurred. Successive regimes of the 19th century responded to such pressures
with a combination of halfhearted reform and repression. Russian serfdom was
abolished in 1861, but its abolition was achieved on terms unfavorable to the
peasants and served to increase revolutionary pressures. Between the abolition
of serfdom and the beginning of World War I in 1914, the Stolypin reforms, the
constitution of 1906 and State Duma introduced notable changes to the economy
and politics of Russia, but the tsars were still not willing to relinquish
autocratic rule, or share their power. The Russian Revolution in 1917 was
triggered by a combination of economic breakdown, war weariness, and discontent
with the autocratic system of government, and it first brought a coalition of
liberals and moderate socialists to power, but their failed policies led to
seizure of power by the Communist Bolsheviks on 25 October. Between 1922 and
1991, the history of Russia is essentially the history of the Soviet Union,
effectively an ideologically based state which was roughly conterminous with
the Russian Empire before the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. The approach to the
building of socialism, however, varied over different periods in Soviet
history, from the mixed economy and diverse society and culture of the 1920s to
the command economy and repressions of the Joseph Stalin era to the "era of
stagnation" in the 1980s. From its first years, government in the Soviet Union
was based on the one-party rule of the Communists, as the Bolsheviks called
themselves, beginning in March 1918. However, by the late 1980s, with the
weaknesses of its economic and political structures becoming acute, the
Communist leaders embarked on major reforms, which led to the fall of the
Soviet Union. The history of the Russian Federation officially starts in
January 1992. The Russian Federation was recognized as the legal successor to
the Soviet Union on the international stage. However, Russia has lost its
superpower status as it faced serious challenges in its efforts to forge a new
post-Soviet political and economic system. Scrapping the socialist central
planning and state ownership of property of the Soviet era, Russia attempted to
build an economy based on market capitalism, with often painful results. Even
today Russia shares many continuities of political culture and social structure
with its tsarist and Soviet past. Early history. Pre-Slavic inhabitants. During
the prehistoric eras the vast steppes of Southern Russia were home to tribes of
nomadic pastoralists. In classical antiquity, the Pontic Steppe was known as
Scythia. Remnants of these long-gone steppe civilizations were discovered in
the course of the 20th century in such places as Ipatovo, Sintashta, Arkaim,
and Pazyryk. In the latter part of the 8th century BC, Greek merchants brought
classical civilization to the trade emporiums in Tanais and Phanagoria. Gelonus
was described by Herodotos as a huge (Europe's biggest) earth- and wood-
fortified grad inhabited around 500 BC by Heloni and Budini. At about the 2nd
century AD Goths migrated to the Black Sea, and in the 3rd and 4th centuries
AD, a semi-legendary Gothic kingdom of Oium existed in Southern Russia until it
was overrun by Huns. Between the 3rd and 6th centuries AD, the Bosporan
Kingdom, a Hellenistic polity which succeeded the Greek colonies, was also
overwhelmed by successive waves of nomadic invasions, led by warlike tribes
which would often move on to Europe, as was the case with the Huns and Turkish
Avars. A Turkic people, the Khazars, ruled the lower Volga basin steppes
between the Caspian and Black Seas through to the 8th century. Noted for their
laws, tolerance, and cosmopolitanism, the Khazars were the main commercial link
between the Baltic and the Muslim Abbasid empire centered in Baghdad. They were
important allies of the Byzantine Empire, and waged a series of successful wars
against the Arab Caliphates. In the 8th century, the Khazars embraced Judaism.
Early East Slavs. The ancestors of the Russians were the Slavic tribes, whose
original home is thought by some scholars to have been the wooded areas of the
Pripet Marshes. The Early East Slavs gradually settled Western Russia in two
waves: one moving from Kiev towards present-day Suzdal and Murom and another
from Polotsk towards Novgorod and Rostov. From the 7th century onwards, the
East Slavs constituted the bulk of the population in Western Russia and slowly
but peacefully assimilated the native Finno-Ugric tribes, such as the Merya,
the Muromians, and the Meshchera. Kievan Rus'. Scandinavian Norsemen, called
"Vikings" in Western Europe and "Varangians" in the East, combined piracy and
trade in their roamings over much of Northern Europe. In the mid-9th century,
they began to venture along the waterways from the eastern Baltic to the Black
and Caspian Seas. According to the earliest Russian chronicle, a Varangian
named Rurik was elected ruler ("knyaz") of Novgorod in about 860, before his
successors moved south and extended their authority to Kiev, which had been
previously dominated by the Khazars. Thus, the first East Slavic state, Kievan
Rus', emerged in the 9th century along the Dnieper River valley. A coordinated
group of princely states with a common interest in maintaining trade along the
river routes, Kievan Rus' controlled the trade route for furs, wax, and slaves
between Scandinavia and the Byzantine Empire along the Volkhov and Dnieper
Rivers. The name "Russia", together with the Finnish "Ruotsi" (which means
"Sweden") and Estonian "Rootsi" (which means "Sweden"), are found by some
scholars to be related to Roslagen. The etymology of "Rus" and its derivatives
are debated, and other schools of thought connect the name with Slavic or
Iranic roots. By the end of the 10th century, the Norse minority had merged
with the Slavic population, which also absorbed Greek Christian influences in
the course of the multiple campaigns to loot Tsargrad, or Constantinople. One
such campaign claimed the life of the foremost Slavic druzhina leader,
Svyatoslav I, who was renowned for having crushed the power of the Khazars on
the Volga. At the time, the Byzantine Empire was experiencing a major military
and cultural revival; despite its later decline, its culture would have a
continuous influence on the development of Russia in its formative centuries.
Kievan Rus' is important for its introduction of a Slavic variant of the
Eastern Orthodox religion, dramatically deepening a synthesis of Byzantine and
Slavic cultures that defined Russian culture for the next thousand years. The
region adopted Christianity in 988 by the official act of public baptism of
Kiev inhabitants by Prince Vladimir I. Some years later the first code of laws,
Russkaya Pravda, was introduced. From the onset the Kievan princes followed the
Byzantine example and kept the Church dependent on them, even for its revenues,
so that the Russian Church and state were always closely linked. By the 11th
century, particularly during the reign of Yaroslav the Wise, Kievan Rus'
displayed an economy and achievements in architecture and literature superior
to those that then existed in the western part of the continent. Compared with
the languages of European Christendom, the Russian language was little
influenced by the Greek and Latin of early Christian writings. This was because
Church Slavonic was used directly in liturgy instead. A nomadic Turkic people,
the Kipchaks (also known as the Cumans), replaced the earlier Pechenegs as the
dominant force in the south steppe regions neighbouring to Rus' at the end of
the 11th century and founded a nomadic state in the steppes along the Black Sea
(Desht-e-Kipchak). Repelling their regular attacks, especially on Kiev, which
was just one day's ride from the steppe, was a heavy burden for the southern
areas of Rus'. The nomadic incursions caused a massive influx of Slavs to the
safer, heavily forested regions of the north, particularly to the area known as
Zalesye. Kievan Rus' ultimately disintegrated as a state because of in-fighting
between members of the princely family that ruled it collectively. Kiev's
dominance waned, to the benefit of Vladimir-Suzdal in the north-east, Novgorod
in the north, and Halych-Volhynia in the south-west. Conquest by the Mongol
Golden Horde in the 13th century was the final blow. Kiev was destroyed.
Halych-Volhynia would eventually be absorbed into the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian
Commonwealth, while the Mongol-dominated Vladimir-Suzdal and independent
Novgorod Republic, two regions on the periphery of Kiev, would establish the
basis for the modern Russian nation. Mongol invasion. The invading Mongols
accelerated the fragmentation of the Rus'. In 1223, the disunited southern
princes faced a Mongol raiding party at the Kalka River and were soundly
defeated. In 1237‚Äì1238 the Mongols burnt down the city of Vladimir (4
February 1238) and other major cities of northeast Russia, routed the Russians
at the Sit' River, and then moved west into Poland and Hungary. By then they
had conquered most of the Russian principalities. Only the Novgorod Republic
escaped occupation and continued to flourish in the orbit of the Hanseatic
League. The impact of the Mongol invasion on the territories of Kievan Rus' was
uneven. The advanced city culture was almost completely destroyed. As older
centers such as Kiev and Vladimir never recovered from the devastation of the
initial attack, the new cities of Moscow, Tver and Nizhny Novgorod began to
compete for hegemony in the Mongol-dominated Russia. Although a Russian army
defeated the Golden Horde at Kulikovo in 1380, Mongol domination of the
Russian-inhabited territories, along with demands of tribute from Russian
princes, continued until about 1480. Russo-Tatar relations. After the fall of
the Khazars in the 10th century, the middle Volga came to be dominated by the
mercantile state of Volga Bulgaria, the last vestige of Greater Bulgaria
centered at Phanagoria. In the 10th century the Turkic population of Volga
Bulgaria converted to Islam, which facilitated its trade with the Middle East
and Central Asia. In the wake of the Mongol invasions of the 1230s, Volga
Bulgaria was absorbed by the Golden Horde and its population evolved into the
modern Chuvashes and Kazan Tatars. The Mongols held Russia and Volga Bulgaria
in sway from their western capital at Sarai, one of the largest cities of the
medieval world. The princes of southern and eastern Russia had to pay tribute
to the Mongols of the Golden Horde, commonly called Tatars; but in return they
received charters authorizing them to act as deputies to the khans. In general,
the princes were allowed considerable freedom to rule as they wished, while the
Russian Orthodox Church even experienced a spiritual revival under the guidance
of Metropolitan Alexis and Sergius of Radonezh. To the Orthodox Church and most
princes, the fanatical Northern Crusaders seemed a greater threat to the
Russian way of life than the Mongols. In the mid-13th century, Alexander
Nevsky, elected prince of Novgorod, acquired heroic status as the result of
major victories over the Teutonic Knights and the Swedes. Alexander obtained
Mongol protection and assistance in fighting invaders from the west who, hoping
to profit from the Russian collapse since the Mongol invasions, tried to grab
territory and convert the Russians to Roman Catholicism. The Mongols left their
impact on the Russians in such areas as military tactics and transportation.
Under Mongol occupation, Russia also developed its postal road network, census,
fiscal system, and military organization. Eastern influence remained strong
well until the 17th century, when Russian rulers made a conscious effort to
modernize their country. In popular memory, this period left a very unpleasant
impression, and is referred to as the Tataro-Mongol Yoke. Grand Duchy of
Moscow. The rise of Moscow. Daniil Aleksandrovich, the youngest son of
Alexander Nevsky, founded the principality of Moscow (known as Muscovy in
English), which eventually expelled the Tatars from Russia. Well-situated in
the central river system of Russia and surrounded by protective forests and
marshes, Moscow was at first only a vassal of Vladimir, but soon it absorbed
its parent state. A major factor in the ascendancy of Moscow was the
cooperation of its rulers with the Mongol overlords, who granted them the title
of Grand Prince of Moscow and made them agents for collecting the Tatar tribute
from the Russian principalities. The principality's prestige was further
enhanced when it became the center of the Russian Orthodox Church. Its head,
the Metropolitan, fled from Kiev to Vladimir in 1299 and a few years later
established the permanent headquarters of the Church in Moscow under the
original title of Kiev Metropolitan. By the middle of the 14th century, the
power of the Mongols was declining, and the Grand Princes felt able to openly
oppose the Mongol yoke. In 1380, at Kulikovo on the Don River, the Mongols were
defeated, and although this hard-fought victory did not end Tatar rule of
Russia, it did bring great fame to the Grand Prince Dmitry Donskoy. Moscow's
leadership in Russia was now firmly based and by the middle of the 14th century
its territory had greatly expanded through purchase, war, and marriage. Ivan
III, the Great. In the 15th century, the grand princes of Moscow went on
gathering Russian lands to increase the population and wealth under their rule.
The most successful practitioner of this process was Ivan III who laid the
foundations for a Russian national state. Ivan competed with his powerful
northwestern rival, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, for control over some of the
semi-independent Upper Principalities in the upper Dnieper and Oka River
basins. Through the defections of some princes, border skirmishes, and a long
war with the Novgorod Republic, Ivan III was able to annex Novgorod and Tver.
As a result, the Grand Duchy of Moscow tripled in size under his rule. During
his conflict with Pskov, a monk named Filofei (Philotheus of Pskov) composed a
letter to Ivan III, with the prophecy that the latter's kingdom will be the
Third Rome. The Fall of Constantinople and the death of the last Greek Orthodox
Christian emperor contributed to this new idea of Moscow as 'New Rome' and the
seat of Orthodox Christianity. A contemporary of the Tudors and other "new
monarchs" in Western Europe, Ivan proclaimed his absolute sovereignty over all
Russian princes and nobles. Refusing further tribute to the Tatars, Ivan
initiated a series of attacks that opened the way for the complete defeat of
the declining Golden Horde, now divided into several Khanates and hordes. Ivan
and his successors sought to protect the southern boundaries of their domain
against attacks of the Crimean Tatars and other hordes. To achieve this aim,
they sponsored the construction of the Great Abatis Belt and granted manors to
nobles, who were obliged to serve in the military. The manor system provided a
basis for an emerging horse army. In this way, internal consolidation
accompanied outward expansion of the state. By the 16th century, the rulers of
Moscow considered the entire Russian territory their collective property.
Various semi-independent princes still claimed specific territories, but Ivan
III forced the lesser princes to acknowledge the grand prince of Moscow and his
descendants as unquestioned rulers with control over military, judicial, and
foreign affairs. Gradually, the Russian ruler emerged as a powerful, autocratic
ruler, a tsar. The first Russian ruler to officially crown himself "Tsar" was
Ivan IV. Tsardom of Russia. Ivan IV, the Terrible. The development of the
Tsar's autocratic powers reached a peak during the reign (1547‚Äì1584) of Ivan
IV ("Ivan the Terrible"). He strengthened the position of the monarch to an
unprecedented degree, as he ruthlessly subordinated the nobles to his will,
exiling or executing many on the slightest provocation. Nevertheless, Ivan is
often seen as a farsighted statesman who reformed Russia as he promulgated a
new code of laws (Sudebnik of 1550), established the first Russian feudal
representative body (Zemsky Sobor), curbed the influence of clergy, and
introduced the local self-management in rural regions. Although his long
Livonian War for the control of the Baltic coast and the access to sea trade
ultimately proved a costly failure, Ivan managed to annex the Khanates of
Kazan, Astrakhan, and Siberia. These conquests complicated the migration of the
aggressive nomadic hordes from Asia to Europe through Volga and Ural. Through
these conquests, Russia acquired a significant Muslim Tatar population and
emerged as a multiethnic and state. Also around this period, the mercantile
Stroganov family established a firm foothold at the Urals and recruited Russian
Cossacks to colonise Siberia. In the later part of his reign, Ivan divided his
realm in two. In the zone known as the "oprichnina", Ivan's followers carried
out a series of bloody purges of the feudal aristocracy (which he suspected of
treachery after the betrayal of prince Kurbsky), culminating in the Massacre of
Novgorod (1570). This combined with the military losses, epidemics, poor
harvests so weakened Russia that the Crimean Tatars were able to sack central
Russian regions and burn down Moscow (1571). In 1572 Ivan abandoned the
"oprichnina". At the end of Ivan IV's reign the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian and Swedish
armies carried out a powerful intervention in Russia, devastating its northern
and northwest regions. Time of Troubles. [[File:Appeal of Minin.jpg|thumb|Kuzma
Minin appeals to the people of Nizhny Novgorod to raise a volunteer army
against the Poles.]] The death of Ivan's childless son Feodor was followed by a
period of civil wars and foreign intervention known as the "Time of Troubles"
(1606‚Äì13). Extremely cold summers (1601‚Äì1603) wrecked crops, which led to
the Russian famine of 1601‚Äì1603 and increased the social disorganization.
Boris Godunov's(–ë–æ—Ä–∏—Å –ì–æ–¥—É–Ω–æ–≤) reign ended in chaos, civil war
combined with foreign intrusion, devastation of many cities and depopulation of
the rural regions. The country rocked by internal chaos also attracted several
waves of interventions by the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. During the
Polish‚ÄìMuscovite War (1605‚Äì1618), Polish‚ÄìLithuanian forces reached Moscow
and installed the impostor False Dmitriy I in 1605, then supported False Dmitry
II in 1607. The decisive moment came when a combined Russian-Swedish army was
routed by the Polish forces under hetman Stanis≈Çaw ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski at the Battle
of Klushino on . As the result of the battle, the Seven Boyars, a group of
Russian nobles, deposed the tsar Vasily Shuysky on , and recognized the Polish
prince W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV Vasa as the Tsar of Russia on . The Poles entered Moscow
on . Moscow revolted but riots there were brutally suppressed and the city was
set on fire. The crisis provoked a patriotic national uprising against the
invasion, both in 1611 and 1612. Finally, a volunteer army, led by the merchant
Kuzma Minin and prince Dmitry Pozharsky, expelled the foreign forces from the
capital on . The Russian statehood survived the "Time of Troubles" and the rule
of weak or corrupt Tsars because of the strength of the government's central
bureaucracy. Government functionaries continued to serve, regardless of the
ruler's legitimacy or the faction controlling the throne. However, the "Time of
Troubles" provoked by the dynastic crisis resulted in the loss of much
territory to the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth in the Russo-Polish war, as
well as to the Swedish Empire in the Ingrian War. The accession of Romanovs and
early rule. In February 1613, with the chaos ended and the Poles expelled from
Moscow, a national assembly, composed of representatives from fifty cities and
even some peasants, elected Michael Romanov, the young son of Patriarch
Filaret, to the throne. The Romanov dynasty ruled Russia until 1917. The
immediate task of the new dynasty was to restore peace. Fortunately for Moscow,
its major enemies, the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth and Sweden, were
engaged in a bitter conflict with each other, which provided Russia the
opportunity to make peace with Sweden in 1617 and to sign a truce with the
Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth in 1619. Recovery of lost territories started
in the mid-17th century, when the Khmelnitsky Uprising in Ukraine against
Polish rule brought about the Treaty of Pereyaslav concluded between Russia and
the Ukrainian Cossacks. According to the treaty, Russia granted protection to
the Cossacks state in the Left-bank Ukraine, formerly under Polish control.
This triggered a prolonged Russo-Polish War which ended with the Treaty of
Andrusovo (1667), where Poland accepted the loss of Left-bank Ukraine, Kiev and
Smolensk. Rather than risk their estates in more civil war, the great nobles or
"boyars" cooperated with the first Romanovs, enabling them to finish the work
of bureaucratic centralization. Thus, the state required service from both the
old and the new nobility, primarily in the military. In return the tsars
allowed the "boyars" to complete the process of enserfing the peasants. In the
preceding century, the state had gradually curtailed peasants' rights to move
from one landlord to another. With the state now fully sanctioning serfdom,
runaway peasants became state fugitives, and the power of the landlords over
the peasants "attached" to their land had become almost complete. Together the
state and the nobles placed the overwhelming burden of taxation on the
peasants, whose rate was 100 times greater in the mid-17th century than it had
been a century earlier. In addition, middle-class urban tradesmen and craftsmen
were assessed taxes, and, like the serfs, they were forbidden to change
residence. All segments of the population were subject to military levy and to
special taxes. Under such circumstances, peasant disorders were endemic; even
the citizens of Moscow revolted against the Romanovs during the Salt Riot
(1648), Copper Riot (1662), and the Moscow Uprising (1682). By far the greatest
peasant uprising in 17th-century Europe erupted in 1667. As the free settlers
of South Russia, the Cossacks, reacted against the growing centralization of
the state, serfs escaped from their landlords and joined the rebels. The
Cossack leader Stenka Razin led his followers up the Volga River, inciting
peasant uprisings and replacing local governments with Cossack rule. The tsar's
army finally crushed his forces in 1670; a year later Stenka was captured and
beheaded. Yet, less than half a century later, the strains of military
expeditions produced another revolt in Astrakhan, ultimately subdued. Imperial
Russia. Peter the Great. Peter the Great (1672‚Äì1725) brought autocracy into
Russia and played a major role in bringing his country into the European state
system. From its modest beginnings in the 14th-century principality of Moscow,
Russia had become the largest state in the world by Peter's reign. Three times
the size of continental Europe, it spanned the Eurasian landmass from the
Baltic Sea to the Pacific Ocean. Much of its expansion had taken place in the
17th century, culminating in the first Russian settlement of the Pacific in the
mid-17th century, the reconquest of Kiev, and the pacification of the Siberian
tribes. However, this vast land had a population of only 14 million. Grain
yields trailed behind those of agriculture in the West (that can be partly
explained by the more challenging climatic conditions, in particular long cold
winters and short vegetative period) compelling almost the entire population to
farm. Only a small fraction of the population lived in the towns. Russia
remained isolated from the sea trade, its internal trade communications and
many manufactures were dependent on the seasonal changes. Peter's first
military efforts were directed against the Ottoman Turks. His attention then
turned to the north. Peter still lacked a secure northern seaport except at
Archangel on the White Sea, whose harbor was frozen nine months a year. Access
to the Baltic was blocked by Sweden, whose territory enclosed it on three
sides. Peter's ambitions for a "window to the sea" led him in 1699 to make a
secret alliance with the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth and Denmark against
Sweden resulting in the Great Northern War. The war ended in 1721 when an
exhausted Sweden sued for peace with Russia. Peter acquired four provinces
situated south and east of the Gulf of Finland, thus securing his coveted
access to the sea. There, in 1703, he had already founded the city that was to
become Russia's new capital, Saint Petersburg, as a "window opened upon Europe"
to replace Moscow, long Russia's cultural center. Russian intervention in the
Commonwealth marked, with the Silent Sejm, the beginning of a 200-year
domination of that region by the Russian Empire. In celebration of his
conquests, Peter assumed the title of emperor as well as tsar, and Russian
Tsardom officially became the Russian Empire in 1721. Peter reorganized his
government on the latest Western models, molding Russia into an absolutist
state. He replaced the old "boyar" Duma (council of nobles) with a nine-member
senate, in effect a supreme council of state. The countryside was also divided
into new provinces and districts. Peter told the senate that its mission was to
collect tax revenues. In turn tax revenues tripled over the course of his
reign. Administrative Collegia were established in St. Petersburg, to replace
the old governmental departments. In 1722 Peter promulgated his famous Table of
ranks. As part of the government reform, the Orthodox Church was partially
incorporated into the country's administrative structure, in effect making it a
tool of the state. Peter abolished the patriarchate and replaced it with a
collective body, the Holy Synod, led by a lay government official. Peter
continued and intensified his predecessors' requirement of state service for
all nobles. Russia, by the end of Peter's reign, had become a great power.
Peter the Great died in 1725, leaving an unsettled succession. Ruling the
Empire (1725‚Äì1825). Peter I was succeeded by his second wife (Catherine I,
1725‚Äì1728) who was merely a figure-head for a powerful group of high
officials, then by his minor grandson (Peter II, 1728‚Äì1730), then by his
niece, Anna, daughter of Tsar Ivan V. In 1741 Elizabeth, daughter of Peter,
seized the throne, assisted by the Preobrazhensky Regiment. She reigned for
twenty years, a period marked by the establishment of Moscow University and the
abolition of capital punishment, except in cases of high treason. Nearly forty
years were to pass before a comparably ambitious ruler appeared on the Russian
throne. Catherine II, the Great, was a German princess who married the German
heir to the Russian crown. Finding him incompetent, Catherine tacitly consented
to his murder. It was announced that he had died of "apoplexy", and in 1762 she
became ruler. Catherine patronized arts, science and learning. She contributed
to the resurgence of the Russian nobility that began after the death of Peter
the Great. Catherine promulgated Charter to the Gentry reaffirming rights and
freedoms of the Russian nobility, and abolishing mandatory state service.
Catherine the Great extended Russian political control over the
Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth with actions including the support of the
Targowica Confederation, although the cost of her campaigns, on top of the
oppressive social system that required lords' serfs to spend almost all of
their time laboring on the lords' land, provoked a major peasant uprising in
1773, after Catherine legalized the selling of serfs separate from land.
Inspired by another Cossack named Pugachev, with the emphatic cry of "Hang all
the landlords!" the rebels threatened to take Moscow before they were
ruthlessly suppressed. Catherine had Pugachev drawn and quartered in Red
Square, but the specter of revolution continued to haunt her and her
successors. Catherine successfully waged war against the decaying Ottoman
Empire and advanced Russia's southern boundary to the Black Sea. Then, by
allying with the rulers of Austria and Prussia, she incorporated the
territories of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, where after a century of
Russian rule non-Catholic mainly Orthodox population prevailed during the
Partitions of Poland, pushing the Russian frontier westward into Central
Europe. By the time of her death in 1796, Catherine's expansionist policy had
made Russia into a major European power. This continued with Alexander I's
wresting of Finnish War from the weakened kingdom of Sweden in 1809 and of
Bessarabia from the Ottomans in 1812. Napoleon made a major misstep when he
declared war on Russia after a dispute with Tsar Alexander I and launched an
invasion of Russia in 1812. The campaign was a catastrophe. Unable to
decisively engage and defeat the standing Russian armies, Napoleon attempted to
force the Tsar to terms by capturing Moscow at the onset of winter. The
expectation proved futile. Unprepared for winter warfare in the cold Russian
weather, thousands of French troops were ambushed and killed by peasant
guerrilla fighters. As Napoleon's forces retreated, Russian troops pursued them
into Central and Western Europe and to the gates of Paris. After Russia and its
allies defeated Napoleon, Alexander became known as the 'savior of Europe,' and
he presided over the redrawing of the map of Europe at the Congress of Vienna
(1815), which made Alexander the monarch of Congress Poland. Although the
Russian Empire would play a leading political role in the next century, secured
by its defeat of Napoleonic France, its retention of serfdom precluded economic
progress of any significant degree. As West European economic growth
accelerated during the Industrial Revolution, sea trade and colonialism which
had begun in the second half of the 18th century, Russia began to lag ever
farther behind, creating new problems for the empire as a great power. Nicholas
I and the Decembrist Revolt. Russia's great power status obscured the
inefficiency of its government, the isolation of its people, and its economic
backwardness. Following the defeat of Napoleon, Alexander I was willing to
discuss constitutional reforms, and though a few were introduced, no
thoroughgoing changes were attempted. The tsar was succeeded by his younger
brother, Nicholas I (1825‚Äì1855), who at the onset of his reign was confronted
with an uprising. The background of this revolt lay in the Napoleonic Wars,
when a number of well-educated Russian officers traveled in Europe in the
course of the military campaigns, where their exposure to the liberalism of
Western Europe encouraged them to seek change on their return to autocratic
Russia. The result was the Decembrist Revolt (December 1825), the work of a
small circle of liberal nobles and army officers who wanted to install
Nicholas' brother as a constitutional monarch. But the revolt was easily
crushed, leading Nicholas to turn away from the Westernization program begun by
Peter the Great and champion the doctrine "Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and
Nationality". In the early decades of the 19th century, Russia expanded into
South Caucasus and the highlands of the North Caucasus. In 1831 Nicholas
crushed a major uprising in Congress Poland; it would be followed by another
large-scale Polish and Lithuanian revolt in 1863. Ideological schisms and
reaction. In this setting Michael Bakunin would emerge as the father of
anarchism. He left Russia in 1842 to Western Europe, where he became active in
the socialist movement. After participating in the May Uprising in Dresden of
1849, he was imprisoned and shipped to Siberia, but eventually escaped and made
his way back to Europe. There he practically joined forces with Karl Marx,
despite significant ideological and tactical differences. Alternative social
doctrines were elaborated by such Russian radicals as Alexander Herzen and
Peter Kropotkin. The question of Russia's direction had been gaining steam ever
since Peter the Great's program of Westernization. Some favored imitating
Europe while others renounced the West and called for a return of the
traditions of the past. The latter path was championed by Slavophiles, who
heaped scorn on the "decadent" West. The Slavophiles were opponents of
bureaucracy, preferred the collectivism of the medieval Russian "mir", or
village community, to the individualism of the West. However, over the years
since the Patriotic War of 1812 against Napoleon, Russia had been forced into
involvement in the affairs of Europe, as part of the "Holy Alliance." The Holy
Alliance was formed to serve as the "policeman of Europe." However, to be the
policeman of Europe and maintain the Holy alliance needed large armies.
Prussia, Austria, England and France, (the other members of the "Holy
Alliance") had the large armies needed. Thus, the Holy Alliance needed Russia
to supply the required armies. Consequently, as a result of Russia supplying
the armies needed by the Holy Alliance to suppress the revolutionary uprisings
in Europe in 1848 and 1849, Russia became deeply involved in the affairs of
Europe. Luckily for Europe, their need for large armies fit the philosophy of
Tsar Nicholas I. Russia, however, expected that, in exchange for supplying the
troops for the Holy Alliance to serve as the policeman of Europe, should be
that Europe would leave Russia a free hand in dealing with the Ottoman
Empire‚Äîthe "sick man of Europe." Accordingly, some observers, including Karl
Marx and Frederick Engels predicted that there soon would be a Russo-Turkish
War. However, Marx and Engels predicted that any such Russo-Turkish War would
necessarily become a European War. Alexander II and the abolition of serfdom.
Tsar Nicholas died with his philosophy in dispute. One year earlier, Russia had
become involved in the Crimean War, a conflict fought primarily in the Crimean
peninsula. Since playing a major role in the defeat of Napoleon, Russia had
been regarded as militarily invincible, but, once pitted against a coalition of
the great powers of Europe, the reverses it suffered on land and sea exposed
the weakness of Tsar Nicholas' regime. When Alexander II came to the throne in
1855, desire for reform was widespread. The most pressing problem which
confronted the Government was that of serfdom. In 1859, there were 23 million
serfs (total population of Russia 67.1¬ Million). Alexander II made up his own
mind to abolish serfdom from above rather than wait for it to be abolished from
below through revolution. The emancipation of the serfs in 1861 was the single
most important event in 19th-century Russian history. It was the beginning of
the end for the landed aristocracy's monopoly of power. Emancipation brought a
supply of free labor to the cities, industry was stimulated, and the middle
class grew in number and influence. The freed peasants had to buy land,
allotted to them, from the landowners with the state assistance. The Government
issued special bonds to the landowners for the land that they had lost, and
collected a special tax from the peasants, called redemption payments, at a
rate of 5% of the total cost of allotted land yearly. All the land turned over
to the peasants was owned collectively by the "mir", the village community,
which divided the land among the peasants and supervised the various holdings.
Alexander's other important reforms included introduction of local self-
government (Zemstvo) for the rural districts and towns, reform of the
judiciary, and of the military service. In the late 1870s Russia and the
Ottoman Empire again clashed in the Balkans. The Russo-Turkish War was popular
among Russians, who supported the independence of their fellow Orthodox Slavs,
the Serbs and the Bulgarians. However, the war increased tension with Austria-
Hungary, which also had ambitions in the region. During this period Russia
expanded its empire into Central Asia, which was rich in raw materials,
conquering the khanates of Kokand, Bokhara and Khiva, as well as the Trans-
Caspian region. Nihilism. In the 1860s a movement known as Nihilism developed
in Russia. A term originally coined by Ivan Turgenev in his 1862 novel "Fathers
and Sons", Nihilists favoured the destruction of human institutions and laws,
based on the idea that such institutions and laws are artificial and corrupt.
At its core, Russian nihilism was characterized by the belief that the world
lacks comprehensible meaning, objective truth, or value. For some time many
Russian liberals had been dissatisfied by what they regarded as the empty
discussions of the intelligentsia. The Nihilists questioned all old values and
shocked the Russian establishment. They moved beyond being purely philosophical
to becoming major political forces after becoming involved in the cause of
reform. Their path was facilitated by the previous actions of the Decembrists,
who revolted in 1825, and the financial and political hardship caused by the
Crimean War, which caused large numbers of Russian people to lose faith in
political institutions. The Nihilists first attempted to convert the
aristocracy to the cause of reform. Failing there, they turned to the peasants.
Their campaign, which targeted the people instead of the aristocracy or the
landed gentry, became known as the Populist movement. It was based upon the
belief that the common people possessed the wisdom and peaceful ability to lead
the nation. While the Narodnik movement was gaining momentum, the government
quickly moved to extirpate it. In response to the growing reaction of the
government, a radical branch of the Narodniks advocated and practiced
terrorism. One after another, prominent officials were shot or killed by bombs.
This represented the ascendancy of anarchism in Russia as a powerful
revolutionary force. Finally, after several attempts, Alexander II was
assassinated by anarchists in 1881, on the very day he had approved a proposal
to call a representative assembly to consider new reforms in addition to the
abolition of serfdom designed to ameliorate revolutionary demands. Autocracy
and reaction under Alexander III. Unlike his father, the new tsar Alexander III
(1881‚Äì1894) was throughout his reign a staunch reactionary who revived the
maxim of "Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and National Character". A committed
Slavophile, Alexander III believed that Russia could be saved from chaos only
by shutting itself off from the subversive influences of Western Europe. In his
reign Russia concluded the union with republican France to contain the growing
power of Germany, completed the conquest of Central Asia, and exacted important
territorial and commercial concessions from China. The tsar's most influential
adviser was Konstantin Pobedonostsev, tutor to Alexander III and his son
Nicholas, and procurator of the Holy Synod from 1880 to 1895. He taught his
royal pupils to fear freedom of speech and press and to hate democracy,
constitutions, and the parliamentary system. Under Pobedonostsev,
revolutionaries were hunted down and a policy of Russification was carried out
throughout the empire. Nicholas II and a new revolutionary movement. Alexander
was succeeded by his son Nicholas II (1894‚Äì1917). The Industrial Revolution,
which began to exert a significant influence in Russia, was meanwhile creating
forces that would finally overthrow the tsar. Politically, these opposition
forces organized into three competing parties: The liberal elements among the
industrial capitalists and nobility, who believed in peaceful social reform and
a constitutional monarchy, founded the Constitutional Democratic party or
"Kadets" in 1905. Followers of the Narodnik tradition established the
Socialist-Revolutionary Party or "Esers" in 1901, advocating the distribution
of land among those who actually worked it‚Äîthe peasants. A third and more
radical group founded the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party or "RSDLP" in
1898; this party was the primary exponent of Marxism in Russia. Gathering their
support from the radical intellectuals and the urban working class, they
advocated complete social, economic and political revolution. In 1903 the RSDLP
split into two wings: the radical Bolsheviks, led by Lenin, and the relatively
moderate Mensheviks, led by Lenin's former friend Yuli Martov. The Mensheviks
believed that Russian socialism would grow gradually and peacefully and that
the tsar‚Äôs regime should be succeeded by a democratic republic in which the
socialists would cooperate with the liberal bourgeois parties. The Bolsheviks,
under Vladimir Lenin, advocated the formation of a small elite of professional
revolutionists, subject to strong party discipline, to act as the vanguard of
the proletariat in order to seize power by force. The disastrous performance of
the Russian armed forces in the Russo-Japanese War was a major blow to the
Russian State and increased the potential for unrest. In January 1905, an
incident known as "Bloody Sunday" occurred when Father Gapon led an enormous
crowd to the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg to present a petition to the
tsar. When the procession reached the palace, Cossacks opened fire on the
crowd, killing hundreds. The Russian masses were so aroused over the massacre
that a general strike was declared demanding a democratic republic. This marked
the beginning of the Russian Revolution of 1905. Soviets (councils of workers)
appeared in most cities to direct revolutionary activity. In October 1905,
Nicholas reluctantly issued the famous October Manifesto, which conceded the
creation of a national Duma (legislature) to be called without delay. The right
to vote was extended, and no law was to go into force without confirmation by
the Duma. The moderate groups were satisfied; but the socialists rejected the
concessions as insufficient and tried to organize new strikes. By the end of
1905, there was disunity among the reformers, and the tsar's position was
strengthened for the time being. Russian Revolution. Bound by treaty, Tsar
Nicholas II and his subjects entered World War I at the defense of Serbia. At
the opening of hostilities in August 1914, the Russians took the offensive
against both Germany and Austria-Hungary in support of her French ally. Later,
military failures and bureaucratic ineptitude soon turned large segments of the
population against the government. The German and Ottoman fleets prevented
Russia from importing supplies and exporting goods through the Baltic and Black
seas. By the middle of 1915 the impact of the war was demoralizing. Food and
fuel were in short supply, casualties kept occurring, and inflation was
mounting. Strikes increased among low-paid factory workers, and the peasants,
who wanted land reforms, were restless. Meanwhile, public distrust of the
regime was deepened by reports that a semiliterate mystic, Grigori Rasputin,
had great political influence within the government. His assassination in late
1916 ended the scandal but did not restore the autocracy's lost prestige. On 3
March 1917, a strike occurred in a factory in the capital Petrograd (formerly
Saint Petersburg). On 23 February (8 March) 1917, International Women's Day,
thousands of women textile workers in Petrograd walked out of their factories
protesting the lack of food and calling on other workers to join them. Within
days, nearly all the workers in the city were idle, and street fighting broke
out. When the tsar ordered the Duma to disband, ordered strikers to return to
work, and ordered troops to shoot at demonstrators in the streets, his orders
triggered the February Revolution, especially when soldiers openly sided with
the strikers. On 2 March (15), Nicholas II abdicated. To fill the vacuum of
authority, the Duma declared a Provisional Government, headed by Prince Lvov.
Meanwhile, the socialists in Petrograd organized elections among workers and
soldiers to form a soviet (council) of workers' and soldiers' deputies, as an
organ of popular power that could pressure the "bourgeois" Provisional
Government. In July, following a series of crises that undermined their
authority with the public, the head of the Provisional Government resigned and
was succeeded by Alexander Kerensky, who was more progressive than his
predecessor but not radical enough for the Bolsheviks or many Russians
discontented with the deepening economic crisis and the continuation of the
war. While Kerensky's government marked time, the socialist-led soviet in
Petrograd joined with soviets that formed throughout the country to create a
national movement. Lenin returned to Russia from exile in Switzerland with the
help of Germany, which hoped that widespread strife would cause Russia to
withdraw from the war. After many behind-the-scenes maneuvers, the soviets
seized control of the government in November 1917, and drove Kerensky and his
moderate provisional government into exile, in the events that would become
known as the October Revolution. When the national Constituent Assembly,
elected in December 1917 and meeting in January 1918, refused to become a
rubber-stamp of the Bolsheviks, it was dissolved by Lenin's troops. With the
dissolution of the constituent assembly, all vestiges of bourgeois democracy
were removed. With the handicap of the moderate opposition removed, Lenin was
able to free his regime from the war problem by the harsh Treaty of Brest-
Litovsk (1918) with Germany, in which Russia lost the territories of Finland,
Estonia, Lithuania, Poland, the parts of the territories of Latvia and Belarus
(line Riga-Dvinsk-Druia-Drisvyaty-Mikhalishki-Dzevalishki-Dokudova-r.Neman-
r.Yelvyanka-Pruzhany-Vidoml), and the territories captured from the Ottoman
Empire during World War I. On 13 November 1918 the Soviet government cancelled
the Treaty of Brest. Russian Civil War. The Bolshevik grip on power was by no
means secure and a lengthy struggle broke out between the new regime and its
opponents, who included the Socialist Revolutionaries, right-wing "Whites" and
large numbers of peasants. At the same time the Allied powers sent several
expeditionary armies to support the anti-Communist forces in an attempt to
force Russia to rejoin the world war. The Bolsheviks fought against these
forces and against national independence movements in the former Russian
Empire. By 1921, they had defeated their internal enemies and brought most of
the newly independent states under their control, with the exception of
Finland, the Baltic States, the Moldavian Democratic Republic (which joined
Romania), and Poland (with whom they had fought the Polish-Soviet War). Finland
also annexed the region Pechenga of the Russian Kola peninsula; Soviet Russia
and allied Soviet republics conceded the parts of its territory to Estonia
(Petseri County and Estonian Ingria), Latvia (Pytalovo) and Turkey (Kars).
Poland incorporated the contested territories of Western Belarus and Western
Ukraine, the former parts of the Russian Empire (except Galicia) east to Curzon
Line. Soviet Union. Creation of the Soviet Union. The history of Russia between
1922 and 1991 is essentially the history of the Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics or Soviet Union. This ideologically based union, established in
December 1922 by the leaders of the Russian Communist Party, was roughly
coterminous with Russia before the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. At that time, the
new nation included four constituent republics: the Russian SFSR, the Ukrainian
SSR, Belarusian SSR, and the Transcaucasian SFSR. The constitution, adopted in
1924, established a federal system of government based on a succession of
soviets set up in villages, factories, and cities in larger regions. This
pyramid of soviets in each constituent republic culminated in the All-Union
Congress of Soviets. But while it appeared that the congress exercised
sovereign power, this body was actually governed by the Communist Party, which
in turn was controlled by the Politburo from Moscow, the capital of the Soviet
Union, just as it had been under the tsars before Peter the Great. War
Communism and the New Economic Policy. The period from the consolidation of the
Bolshevik Revolution in 1917 until 1921 is known as the period of war
communism. Land, all industry and small businesses were nationalized and the
money economy was restricted. Strong opposition soon developed. The peasants
wanted cash payments for their products and resented having to surrender their
surplus grain to the government as a part of its civil war policies. Confronted
with peasant opposition, Lenin began a strategic retreat from war communism
known as the New Economic Policy (NEP). The peasants were freed from wholesale
levies of grain and allowed to sell their surplus produce in the open market.
Commerce was stimulated by permitting private retail trading. The state
continued to be responsible for banking, transportation, heavy industry, and
public utilities. Although the left opposition among the Communists criticized
the rich peasants or kulaks who benefited from the NEP, the program proved
highly beneficial and the economy revived. The NEP would later come under
increasing opposition from within the party following Lenin's death in early
1924. Changes in Russian society. While the Russian economy was being
transformed, the social life of the people underwent equally drastic changes.
From the beginning of the revolution, the government attempted to weaken
patriarchal domination of the family. Divorce no longer required court
procedure; and to make women completely free of the responsibilities of
childbearing, abortion was made legal as early as 1920. As a side effect, the
emancipation of the women increased the labor market. Girls were encouraged to
secure an education and pursue a career in the factory or the office. Communal
nurseries were set up for the care of small children and efforts were made to
shift the center of people's social life from the home to educational and
recreational groups, the soviet clubs. The regime abandoned the tsarist policy
of discriminating against national minorities in favor of a policy of
incorporating the more than two hundred minority groups into Soviet life.
Another feature of the regime was the extension of medical services. Campaigns
were carried out against typhus, cholera, and malaria; the number of doctors
was increased as rapidly as facilities and training would permit; and infant
mortality rates rapidly decreased while life expectancy rapidly increased. The
government also promoted atheism and materialism, which formed the basis of
Marxist theory. It opposed organized religion, especially to break the power of
the Russian Orthodox Church, a former pillar of the old tsarist regime and a
major barrier to social change. Many religious leaders were sent to internal
exile camps. Members of the party were forbidden to attend religious services
and the education system was separated from the Church. Religious teaching was
prohibited except in the home and atheist instruction was stressed in the
schools. Industrialization and Collectivization. The years from 1929 to 1939
comprised a tumultuous decade in Russian history‚Äîa period of massive
industrialization and internal struggles as Joseph Stalin established near
total control over Russian society, wielding virtually unrestrained power.
Following Lenin's death Stalin wrestled to gain control of the Soviet Union
with rival factions in the Politburo, especially Leon Trotsky's. By 1928, with
the Trotskyists either exiled or rendered powerless, Stalin was ready to put a
radical programme of industrialisation into action. In 1929 Stalin proposed the
First Five-Year Plan. Abolishing the NEP, it was the first of a number of plans
aimed at swift accumulation of capital resources through the buildup of heavy
industry, the collectivization of agriculture, and the restricted manufacture
of consumer goods. For the first time in history a government controlled all
economic activity. As a part of the plan, the government took control of
agriculture through the state and collective farms ("kolkhozes"). By a decree
of February 1930, about one million individual peasants ("kulaks") were forced
off their land. Many peasants strongly opposed regimentation by the state,
often slaughtering their herds when faced with the loss of their land. In some
sections they revolted, and countless peasants deemed "kulaks" by the
authorities were executed. The combination of bad weather, deficiencies of the
hastily established collective farms, and massive confiscation of grain
precipitated a serious famine, and several million peasants died of starvation,
mostly in Ukraine and parts of southwestern Russia. The deteriorating
conditions in the countryside drove millions of desperate peasants to the
rapidly growing cities, fueling industrialization, and vastly increasing
Russia's urban population in the space of just a few years. The plans received
remarkable results in areas aside from agriculture. Russia, in many measures
the poorest nation in Europe at the time of the Bolshevik Revolution, now
industrialized at a phenomenal rate, far surpassing Germany's pace of
industrialization in the 19th century and Japan's earlier in the 20th century.
While the Five-Year Plans were forging ahead, Stalin was establishing his
personal power. The NKVD gathered in tens of thousands of Soviet citizens to
face arrest, deportation, or execution. Of the six original members of the 1920
Politburo who survived Lenin, all were purged by Stalin. Old Bolsheviks who had
been loyal comrades of Lenin, high officers in the Red Army, and directors of
industry were liquidated in the Great Purges. Purges in other Soviet republics
also helped centralize control in the USSR. Stalin's repressions led to the
creation of a vast system of internal exile, of considerably greater dimensions
than those set up in the past by the tsars. Draconian penalties were introduced
and many citizens were prosecuted for fictitious crimes of sabotage and
espionage. The labor provided by convicts working in the labor camps of the
Gulag system became an important component of the industrialization effort,
especially in Siberia. An estimated 18 million people passed through the Gulag
system, and perhaps another 15¬ million had experience of some other form of
forced labor. The Soviet Union on the international stage. The Soviet Union
viewed the 1933 accession of fervently anti-Communist Hitler's government to
power in Germany with great alarm from the onset, especially since Hitler
proclaimed the Drang nach Osten as one of the major objectives in his vision of
the German strategy of Lebensraum. The Soviets supported the republicans of
Spain who struggled against fascist German and Italian troops in the Spanish
Civil War In 1938‚Äì1939, immediately prior to WWII, the Soviet Union
successfully fought against Imperial Japan in the Soviet-Japanese Border Wars
in the Russian Far East, which led to Soviet-Japanese neutrality and the tense
border peace that lasted until August 1945. In 1938 Germany annexed Austria
and, together with major Western European powers, signed the Munich Agreement
following which Germany, Hungary and Poland divided Czechoslovakia between
themselves. German plans for further eastward expansion, as well as the lack of
resolve from Western powers to oppose it, became more apparent. Despite the
Soviet Union strongly opposing the Munich deal and repeatedly reaffirming its
readiness to militarily back commitments given earlier to Czechoslovakia, the
Western Betrayal led to the end of Czechoslovakia and further increased fears
in the Soviet Union of a coming German attack. This led the Soviet Union to
rush the modernization of its military industry and to carry out its own
diplomatic maneuvers. In 1939 the Soviet Union signed a Non-aggression pact
with Nazi Germany dividing Eastern Europe into two separate spheres of
influence. Following the pact, the USSR normalized relations with Nazi Germany
and resumed Soviet-German trade. World War II. On 17 September 1939, seventeen
days after the start of World War II and victorious German advance deep into
the Polish territory, the Red Army invaded eastern portions of Poland stating
the "need to protect Ukrainians and Belarusians" there, after the "cessation of
existence" of the Polish state as the justification of the action. As a result,
the Belarusian and Ukrainian Soviet republics' western borders were moved
westward and the new Soviet western border was drawn close to the original
Curzon line. In the meantime the negotiations with Finland about the Soviet-
proposed land swap that would redraw the Soviet-Finnish border further away
from Leningrad failed; and in December 1939 the USSR started a campaign against
Finland, known as the Winter War (1939‚Äì40). The war took a heavy death toll
on the Red Army but forced Finland to sign a Moscow Peace Treaty and cede the
Karelian Isthmus and Ladoga Karelia. In summer 1940 the USSR issued an
ultimatum to Romania forcing it to cede the territories of Bessarabia and
Northern Bukovina. At the same time, the Soviet Union also occupied the three
formerly independent Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania). The peace
with Germany was tense, as both sides were preparing for the military conflict,
and abruptly ended when the Axis forces led by Germany swept across the Soviet
border on 22 June 1941. By the autumn the German army had seized Ukraine, laid
a siege of Leningrad, and threatened to capture the capital, Moscow, itself.
Despite the fact that in December 1941 the Red Army threw off the German forces
from Moscow in a successful counterattack, the Germans retained the strategic
initiative for approximately another year and held a deep offensive in the
south-eastern direction, reaching the Volga and the Caucasus. However, two
major German defeats in Stalingrad and Kursk proved decisive and reversed the
course of the entire World War as Germans never regained the strength to
sustain their offensive operations and the Soviet Union recaptured the
initiative for the rest of the conflict. By the end of 1943, the Red Army had
broken through the German siege of Leningrad and liberated much of Ukraine,
much of Western Russia and moved into Belarus. By the end of 1944, the front
had moved beyond the 1939 Soviet frontiers into eastern Europe. Soviet forces
drove into eastern Germany, capturing Berlin in May 1945. The war with Germany
thus ended triumphantly for the Soviet Union. As agreed at the Yalta
Conference, three months after the Victory Day in Europe the USSR launched the
Soviet invasion of Manchuria, defeating the Japanese troops in neighboring
Manchuria, the last Soviet battle of World War II. Although the Soviet Union
was victorious in World War II, the war resulted in around 26‚Äì27¬ million
Soviet deaths (estimates vary) and had devastated the Soviet economy in the
struggle. Some 1,710 towns and 70 thousand settlements were destroyed. The
occupied territories suffered from the ravages of German occupation and
deportations of slave labor in Germany. Thirteen million Soviet citizens became
victims of a repressive policy of Germans and their allies on an occupied
territory, where people died because of mass murders, famine, absence of
elementary medical aid and slave labor. The Nazi Genocide of the Jews carried
by German "Einsatzgruppen", along the local collaborators resulted in almost
complete annihilation of the Jewish population over the entire territory
temporary occupied by Germany and its allies., [http://
www.einsatzgruppenarchives.com/hofer.html. During occupation, Russia's
Leningrad, now Saint Petersburg, region lost around a quarter of its
population. Soviet Belarus lost from a quarter to a third of its population.
3.6¬ million Soviet prisoners of war (of 5.5¬ million) died in German camps.
Cold War. Collaboration among the major Allies had won the war and was supposed
to serve as the basis for postwar reconstruction and security. However, the
conflict between Soviet and U.S. national interests, known as the Cold War,
came to dominate the international stage in the postwar period. The Cold War
emerged out of a conflict between Stalin and U.S. President Harry Truman over
the future of Eastern Europe during the Potsdam Conference in the summer of
1945. Russia had suffered three devastating Western onslaughts in the previous
150 years during the Napoleonic Wars, the First World War, and the Second World
War, and Stalin's goal was to establish a buffer zone of states between Germany
and the Soviet Union. Truman charged that Stalin had betrayed the Yalta
agreement. With Eastern Europe under Red Army occupation, Stalin was also
biding his time, as his own atomic bomb project was steadily and secretly
progressing. In April 1949 the United States sponsored the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO), a mutual defense pact in which most Western nations
pledged to treat an armed attack against one nation as an assault on all. The
Soviet Union established an Eastern counterpart to NATO in 1955, dubbed the
Warsaw Pact. The division of Europe into Western and Soviet blocks later took
on a more global character, especially after 1949, when the U.S. nuclear
monopoly ended with the testing of a Soviet bomb and the Communist takeover in
China. The foremost objectives of Soviet foreign policy were the maintenance
and enhancement of national security and the maintenance of hegemony over
Eastern Europe. The Soviet Union maintained its dominance over the Warsaw Pact
through crushing the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, suppressing the Prague Spring
in Czechoslovakia in 1968, and supporting the suppression of the Solidarity
movement in Poland in the early 1980s. The Soviet Union opposed the United
States in a number of proxy conflicts all over the world, including Korean War
and Vietnam War. As the Soviet Union continued to maintain tight control over
its sphere of influence in Eastern Europe, the Cold War gave way to "D√©tente"
and a more complicated pattern of international relations in the 1970s in which
the world was no longer clearly split into two clearly opposed blocs. Less
powerful countries had more room to assert their independence, and the two
superpowers were partially able to recognize their common interest in trying to
check the further spread and proliferation of nuclear weapons in treaties such
as SALT I, SALT II, and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. U.S.-Soviet
relations deteriorated following the beginning of the nine-year Soviet War in
Afghanistan in 1979 and the 1980 election of Ronald Reagan, a staunch anti-
communist, but improved as the communist bloc started to unravel in the late
1980s. With the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russia lost the
superpower status that it had won in the Second World War. The Khrushchev and
Brezhnev years. In the power struggle that erupted after Stalin's death in
1953, his closest followers lost out. Nikita Khrushchev solidified his position
in a speech before the Twentieth Congress of the Communist Party in 1956
detailing Stalin's atrocities. In 1964 Khrushchev was impeached by the
Communist Party's Central Committee, charging him with a host of errors that
included Soviet setbacks such as the Cuban Missile Crisis. After a period of
collective leadership led by Leonid Brezhnev, Alexei Kosygin and Nikolai
Podgorny, a veteran bureaucrat, Brezhnev, took Khrushchev's place as Soviet
leader. Brezhnev followed emphasis on heavy industry, instituted the Soviet
economic reform of 1965, and also attempted to ease relationships with the
United States. In the 1960s the USSR became a leading producer and exporter of
petroleum and natural gas. Khrushchev and Brezhnev years were time when Soviet
science and industry peaked. The world's first nuclear power plant was
established in 1954 in Obninsk. Baikal Amur Mainline was built. The Soviet
space program, founded by Sergey Korolev, was especially successful. On 4
October 1957 Soviet Union launched the first space satellite Sputnik. On 12
April 1961 Yuri Gagarin became the first human to travel into space in the
Soviet spaceship Vostok 1. Other achievements of Russian space program include:
the first photo of the far side of the Moon; exploration of Venus; the first
spacewalk by Alexey Leonov; first female spaceflight by Valentina Tereshkova.
More recently, the Soviet Union produced the world's first space station,
Salyut which in 1986 was replaced by Mir, the first consistently inhabited
long-term space station, that served from 1986 to 2001. Breakup of the Union.
Two developments dominated the decade that followed: the increasingly apparent
crumbling of the Soviet Union's economic and political structures, and the
patchwork attempts at reforms to reverse that process. After the rapid
succession of former KGB Chief Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko,
transitional figures with deep roots in Brezhnevite tradition, Mikhail
Gorbachev announced perestroika in an attempt to modernize Soviet communism,
and made significant changes in the party leadership. However, Gorbachev's
social reforms led to unintended consequences. Because of his policy of
"glasnost", which facilitated public access to information after decades of
government repression, social problems received wider public attention,
undermining the Communist Party's authority. In the revolutions of 1989 the
USSR lost its allies in Eastern Europe. "Glasnost" allowed ethnic and
nationalist disaffection to reach the surface. Many constituent republics,
especially the Baltic republics, Georgian SSR and Moldavian SSR, sought greater
autonomy, which Moscow was unwilling to provide. Gorbachev's attempts at
economic reform were not sufficient, and the Soviet government left intact most
of the fundamental elements of communist economy. Suffering from low pricing of
petroleum and natural gas, ongoing war in Afghanistan, outdated industry and
pervasive corruption, the Soviet planned economy proved to be ineffective, and
by 1990 the Soviet government had lost control over economic conditions. Due to
price control, there were shortages of almost all products, reaching their peak
in the end of 1991, when people had to stand in long lines and to be lucky
enough to buy even the essentials. Control over the constituent republics was
also relaxed, and they began to assert their national sovereignty over Moscow.
The tension between Soviet Union and Russian SFSR authorities came to be
personified in the bitter power struggle between Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin.
Squeezed out of Union politics by Gorbachev in 1987, Yeltsin, who represented
himself as a committed democrat, presented a significant opposition to
Gorbachev authority. In a remarkable reversal of fortunes, he gained election
as chairman of the Russian republic's new Supreme Soviet in May 1990. The
following month, he secured legislation giving Russian laws priority over
Soviet laws and withholding two-thirds of the budget. In the first Russian
presidential election in 1991 Yeltsin became president of the Russian SFSR. At
last Gorbachev attempted to restructure the Soviet Union into a less
centralized state. However, on 19 August 1991, a coup against Gorbachev,
conspired by senior Soviet officials, was attempted. The coup faced wide
popular opposition and collapsed in three days, but disintegration of the Union
became imminent. The Russian government took over most of the Soviet Union
government institutions on its territory. Because of the dominant position of
Russians in the Soviet Union, most gave little thought to any distinction
between Russia and the Soviet Union before the late 1980s. In the Soviet Union,
only Russian SFSR lacked even the paltry instruments of statehood that the
other republics possessed, such as its own republic-level Communist Party
branch, trade union councils, Academy of Sciences, and the like. The Communist
Party of the Soviet Union was banned in Russia in 1991‚Äì1992, although no
lustration has ever taken place, and many of its members became top Russian
officials. However, as the Soviet government was still opposed to market
reforms, the economic situation continued to deteriorate. By December 1991, the
shortages had resulted in the introduction of food rationing in Moscow and
Saint Petersburg for the first time since World War II. Russia received
humanitarian food aid from abroad. After the Belavezha Accords, the Supreme
Soviet of Russia withdrew Russia from the Soviet Union on 12 December. The
Soviet Union officially ended on 25 December 1991, and the Russian Federation
(formerly the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic) took power on 26
December. The Russian government lifted price control on January 1992. Prices
rose dramatically, but shortages disappeared. Russian Federation. Although
Yeltsin came to power on a wave of optimism, he never recovered his popularity
after endorsing Yegor Gaidar's "shock therapy" of ending Soviet-era price
controls, drastic cuts in state spending, and an open foreign trade regime in
early 1992 ("see" Russian economic reform in the 1990s). The reforms
immediately devastated the living standards of much of the population. In the
1990s Russia suffered an economic downturn that was, in some ways, more severe
than the United States or Germany had undergone six decades earlier in the
Great Depression. Hyperinflation hit the ruble, due to monetary overhang from
the days of the planned economy. Meanwhile, the profusion of small parties and
their aversion to coherent alliances left the legislature chaotic. During 1993,
Yeltsin's rift with the parliamentary leadership led to the September‚ÄìOctober
1993 constitutional crisis. The crisis climaxed on 3 October, when Yeltsin
chose a radical solution to settle his dispute with parliament: he called up
tanks to shell the Russian White House, blasting out his opponents. As Yeltsin
was taking the unconstitutional step of dissolving the legislature, Russia came
close to a serious civil conflict. Yeltsin was then free to impose the current
Russian constitution with strong presidential powers, which was approved by
referendum in December 1993. The cohesion of the Russian Federation was also
threatened when the republic of Chechnya attempted to break away, leading to
the First and Second Chechen Wars. Economic reforms also consolidated a semi-
criminal oligarchy with roots in the old Soviet system. Advised by Western
governments, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund, Russia
embarked on the largest and fastest privatization that the world had ever seen
in order to reform the fully nationalized Soviet economy. By mid-decade,
retail, trade, services, and small industry was in private hands. Most big
enterprises were acquired by their old managers, engendering a new rich
(Russian tycoons) in league with criminal mafias or Western investors. That
being said, there were corporate raiders such as Andrei Volgin engaged in
hostile takeovers of corrupt corporations by the mid-1990s. By the mid-1990s
Russia had a system of multiparty electoral politics. But it was harder to
establish a representative government because of two structural problems‚Äîthe
struggle between president and parliament and the anarchic party system.
Meanwhile, the central government had lost control of the localities,
bureaucracy, and economic fiefdoms; tax revenues had collapsed. Still in deep
depression by the mid-1990s, Russia's economy was hit further by the financial
crash of 1998. After the 1998 financial crisis, Yeltsin was at the end of his
political career. Just hours before the first day of 2000, Yeltsin made a
surprise announcement of his resignation, leaving the government in the hands
of the little-known Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, a former KGB official and
head of the KGB's post-Soviet successor agency FSB. In 2000, the new acting
president defeated his opponents in the presidential election on 26 March, and
won a landslide 4 years later. International observers were alarmed by late
2004 moves to further tighten the presidency's control over parliament, civil
society, and regional officeholders. In 2008 Dmitri Medvedev, a former Gazprom
chairman and Putin's head of staff, was elected new President of Russia.
However, Putin would take back Presidency 2012. Nevertheless, reversion to a
socialist command economy seemed almost impossible, meeting widespread relief
in the West. Russia ended 2006 with its eighth straight year of growth,
averaging 6.7% annually since the financial crisis of 1998. Although high oil
prices and a relatively cheap ruble initially drove this growth, since 2003
consumer demand and, more recently, investment have played a significant role.
Russia is well ahead of most other resource-rich countries in its economic
development, with a long tradition of education, science, and industry. Further
