Roman Republic The Roman Republic () was the period of the ancient Roman
civilization when the government operated as a republic. It began with the
overthrow of the Roman monarchy, traditionally dated around 509 BC, and its
replacement by a government headed by two consuls, elected annually by the
citizens and advised by a senate. A complex constitution gradually developed,
centered on the principles of a separation of powers and checks and balances.
Except in times of dire national emergency, public offices were limited to one
year, so that, in theory at least, no single individual could dominate his
fellow citizens. Roman society was hierarchical. The evolution of the
Constitution of the Roman Republic was heavily influenced by the struggle
between the patricians, Rome's land-holding aristocracy, who traced their
ancestry back to the early history of the Roman kingdom, and the plebeians, the
far more numerous citizen-commoners. Over time, the laws that gave patricians
exclusive rights to Rome's highest offices were repealed or weakened, and a new
aristocracy emerged from among the plebeian class. The leaders of the Republic
developed a strong tradition and morality requiring public service and
patronage in peace and war, making military and political success inextricably
linked. During the first two centuries of its existence the Republic expanded
through a combination of conquest and alliance, from central Italy to the
entire Italian peninsula. By the following century it included North Africa,
the Iberian Peninsula, Greece, and what is now southern France. Two centuries
after that, towards the end of the 1st century BC, it included the rest of
modern France, and much of the eastern Mediterranean. By this time, despite the
Republic's traditional and lawful constraints against any individual's
acquisition of permanent political powers, Roman politics was dominated by a
small number of Roman leaders, their uneasy alliances punctuated by a series of
civil wars. The victor in one of these civil wars, Octavian, reformed the
Republic as a Principate, with himself as Rome's "first citizen" (princeps).
The Senate continued to sit and debate. Annual magistrates were elected as
before, but final decisions on matters of policy, warfare, diplomacy and
appointments were privileged to the princeps as "first among equals" later to
be known as imperator due to the holding of imperium, from which the term
emperor is derived. His powers were monarchic in all but name, and he held them
for his lifetime, on behalf of the Senate and people of Rome. The Roman
Republic was never restored, but neither was it abolished, so the exact date of
the transition to the Roman Empire is a matter of interpretation. Historians
have variously proposed the appointment of Julius Caesar as perpetual dictator
in 44 BC, the defeat of Mark Antony at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC, and the
Roman Senate's grant of extraordinary powers to under the first settlement and
Octavian adopting the moniker Augustus in 27 BC, as the defining event ending
the Republic. Many of Rome's legal and legislative structures can still be
observed throughout Europe and much of the world in modern nation states and
international organizations. Latin, the language of the Romans, has influenced
language across parts of Europe and the world. Constitution. The Constitution
of the Roman Republic was an unwritten set of guidelines and principles passed
down mainly through precedent. The Roman constitution was not formal or even
official. It was largely unwritten, uncodified, and constantly evolving. Senate
of the Roman Republic. The Senate's ultimate authority derived from the esteem
and prestige of the Senate. This esteem and prestige was based on both
precedent and custom, as well as the high calibre and prestige of the Senators.
The Senate passed decrees, which were called "senatus consulta". This was
officially "advice" from the Senate to a magistrate. In practice, however,
these were usually obeyed by the magistrates. The focus of the Roman Senate was
directed towards foreign policy. Though it technically had no official role in
the management of military conflict, the Senate ultimately was the force that
oversaw such affairs. Legislative Assemblies. The legal status of Roman
citizenship was strictly limited and was a vital prerequisite to possessing
many important legal rights such as the right to trial and appeal, to marry, to
vote, to hold office, to enter binding contracts, and to special tax
exemptions. Not all those rights were available to every citizen - women could
be citizens, but were denied the right to vote or hold elected office. An adult
male citizen with the full complement of legal and political rights was called
"optimo jure." The optimo jure elected their assemblies, whereupon the
assemblies elected magistrates, enacted legislation, presided over trials in
capital cases, declared war and peace, and forged or dissolved treaties. There
were two types of legislative assemblies. The first was the "comitia"
("committees"), which were assemblies of all optimo jure. The second was the
"concilia" ("councils"), which were assemblies of specific groups of optimo
jure. Assembly of the Centuries. Citizens were organized on the basis of
centuries and tribes. The centuries and the tribes would each gather into their
own assemblies. The Comitia Centuriata ("Century Assembly") was the assembly of
the centuries. The president of the Comitia Centuriata was usually a consul.
The centuries would vote, one at a time, until a measure received support from
a majority of the centuries. The Comitia Centuriata would elect magistrates who
had "imperium" powers (consuls and praetors). It also elected censors. Only the
Comitia Centuriata could declare war, and ratify the results of a census. It
also served as the highest court of appeal in certain judicial cases. Assembly
of the Tribes. The assembly of the tribes, the Comitia Tributa, was presided
over by a consul, and was composed of 35 tribes. The tribes were not ethnic or
kinship groups, but rather geographical subdivisions. The order that the
thirty-five tribes would vote in was selected randomly by lot. Once a measure
received support from a majority of the tribes, the voting would end. While it
did not pass many laws, the Comitia Tributa did elect quaestors, curule
aediles, and military tribunes. Plebeian Council. The Plebeian Council was an
assembly of plebeians, the non-patrician citizens of Rome, who would gather
into their respective tribes. They elected their own officers, plebeian
tribunes and plebeian aediles. Usually a plebeian tribune would preside over
the assembly. This assembly passed most laws, and could also act as a court of
appeal. Since it was organised on the basis of the tribes, its rules and
procedures were nearly identical to those of the Comitia Tributa. Executive
Magistrates. Each magistrate was vested with a degree of "maior potestas"
("major power"). Each magistrate could veto any action that was taken by a
magistrate of an equal or lower rank. Plebeian tribunes and plebeian aediles,
on the other hand, were independent of the other magistrates. Magisterial
powers, and checks on those powers. Each republican magistrate held certain
constitutional powers. Only the People of Rome (both plebeians "and"
patricians) had the right to confer these powers on any individual magistrate.
The most powerful constitutional power was "imperium". "Imperium" was held by
both consuls and praetors. "Imperium" gave a magistrate the authority to
command a military force. All magistrates also had the power of coercion. This
was used by magistrates to maintain public order. While in Rome, all citizens
had a judgement against coercion. This protection was called "provocatio" (see
below). Magistrates also had both the power and the duty to look for omens.
This power would often be used to obstruct political opponents. One check on a
magistrate's power was his collegiality. Each magisterial office would be held
concurrently by at least two people. Another such check was "provocatio".
"Provocatio" was a primordial form of due process. It was a precursor to
"habeas corpus". If any magistrate tried to use the powers of the state against
a citizen, that citizen could appeal the decision of the magistrate to a
tribune. In addition, once a magistrate's one year term ofoffice expired, he
would have to wait ten years before serving in that office again. This created
problems for some consuls and praetors, and these magistrates would
occasionally have their "imperium" extended. In effect, they would retain the
powers of the office (as a promagistrate), without officially holding that
office. Consuls, praetors, censors, aediles, quaestors, tribunes, and
dictators. The consuls of the Roman Republic were the highest ranking ordinary
magistrates; each consul served for one year. Consuls had supreme power in both
civil and military matters. While in the city of Rome, the consuls were the
head of the Roman government. They would preside over the senate and the
assemblies. While abroad, each consul would command an army. His authority
abroad would be nearly absolute. Praetors administered civil law and commanded
provincial armies. Every five years, two censors were elected for an 18 month
term. During their term in office, the two censors would conduct a census.
During the census, they could enroll citizens in the senate, or purge them from
the senate. Aediles were officers elected to conduct domestic affairs in Rome,
such as managing public games and shows. The quaestors would usually assist the
consuls in Rome, and the governors in the provinces. Their duties were often
financial. Since the tribunes were considered to be the embodiment of the
plebeians, they were sacrosanct. Their sacrosanctity was enforced by a pledge,
taken by the plebeians, to kill any person who harmed or interfered with a
tribune during his term of office. All of the powers of the tribune derived
from their sacrosanctity. One consequence was that it was considered a capital
offense to harm a tribune, to disregard his veto, or to interfere with a
tribune. In times of military emergency, a dictator would be appointed for a
term of six months. Constitutional government would be dissolved, and the
dictator would be the absolute master of the state. When the dictator's term
ended, constitutional government would be restored. Political history. The
constitutional history of the Roman Republic can be divided into five phases.
The first phase began with the revolution which overthrew the monarchy in 509
BC. The final phase ended with the transition that transformed the Republic
into what would effectively be the Roman Empire, in 27 BC. Throughout the
history of the Republic, the constitutional evolution was driven by the
conflict of the orders between the aristocracy and the ordinary citizens.
Patrician Era (509â€“367 BC). According to legend, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus
was overthrown in 509 BC by a group of noblemen led by Lucius Junius Brutus.
Tarquin is said to have made a number of attempts to retake the throne,
including the Tarquinian conspiracy, the war with Veii and Tarquinii and
finally the war between Rome and Clusium, all of which failed to achieve
Tarquin's objectives. The historical monarchy, as the legends suggest, was
probably overthrown quickly, but the constitutional changes which occurred
immediately after the revolution were probably not as extensive as the legends
suggest. The most important constitutional change probably concerned the chief
executive. Before the revolution, a king would be elected by the senators for a
life term. Now, two consuls were elected by the citizens for an annual term.
Each consul would check his colleague, and their limited term in office would
open them up to prosecution if they abused the powers of their office. Consular
political powers, when exercised conjointly with a consular colleague, were no
different from those of the old king. In the immediate aftermath of the
revolution, the senate and the assemblies were as powerless as they had been
under the monarchy. In 494 BC, the city was at war with two neighbouring
tribes. The plebeian soldiers refused to march against the enemy, and instead
seceded to the Aventine Hill. The plebeians demanded the right to elect their
own officials. The patricians agreed, and the plebeians returned to the
battlefield. The plebeians called these new officials "plebeian tribunes". The
tribunes would have two assistants, called "plebeian aediles". From 375 BC to
371 BC, the republic experienced a constitutional crisis during which the
Tribunes of the People used their vetoes to prevent the election of senior
magistrates. In 367 BC a law was passed, which required the election of at
least one plebeian aedile each year. In 443 BC, the censorship was created, and
in 366 BC, the praetorship was created. Also in 366 BC, the curule aedileship
was created. Shortly after the founding of the Republic, the Comitia Centuriata
("Assembly of the Centuries") became the principal legislative assembly. In
this assembly, magistrates were elected, and laws were passed. During the 4th
century BC, a series of reforms were passed. The result of these reforms was
that any law passed by the Plebeian Council would have the full force of law.
This gave the tribunes (who presided over the Plebeian Council) a positive
character for the first time. Before these laws were passed, the only power
that the tribunes held was that of the veto. Conflict of the Orders (367â€“287
BC). After the plebeian aedileship had been created, the patricians created the
curule aedileship. After the consulship had been opened to the plebeians, the
plebeians were able to hold both the dictatorship and the censorship.
Plebiscites of 342 BC placed limits on political offices; an individual could
hold only one office at a time, and ten years must elapse between the end of
his official term and his re-election. Further laws attempted to relieve the
burden of debt from plebeians by banning interest on loans. In 337 BC, the
first plebeian praetor was elected. During these years, the tribunes and the
senators grew increasingly close. The senate realised the need to use plebeian
officials to accomplish desired goals. To win over the tribunes, the senators
gave the tribunes a great deal of power and the tribunes began to feel
obligated to the senate. As the tribunes and the senators grew closer, plebeian
senators were often able to secure the tribunate for members of their own
families. In time, the tribunate became a stepping stone to higher office.
Around the middle of the 4th century BC, the Concilium Plebis enacted the
"Ovinian Law". During the early republic, only consuls could appoint new
senators. The Ovinian law, however, gave this power to the censors. It also
required the censor to appoint any newly elected magistrate to the senate. By
this point, plebeians were already holding a significant number of magisterial
offices. Thus, the number of plebeian senators probably increased quickly.
However, it remained difficult for a plebeian to enter the senate if he was not
from a well-known political family, as a new patrician-like plebeian
aristocracy emerged. The old nobility existed through the force of law, because
only patricians were allowed to stand for high office. The new nobility existed
due to the organization of society. As such, only a revolution could overthrow
this new structure. By 287 BC, the economic condition of the average plebeian
had become poor. The problem appears to have centered around widespread
indebtedness. The plebeians demanded relief, but the senators refused to
address their situation. The result was the final plebeian secession. The
plebeians seceded to the Janiculum hill. To end the secession, a dictator was
appointed. The dictator passed a law (the "Hortensian Law"), which ended the
requirement that the patrician senators must agree before any bill could be
considered by the Plebeian Council. This was not the first law to require that
an act of the Plebeian Council have the full force of law. The Plebeian Council
acquired this power during a modification to the original Valerian law in 449
BC. The significance of this law was in the fact that it robbed the patricians
of their final weapon over the plebeians. The result was that control over the
state fell, not onto the shoulders of voters, but to the new plebeian nobility.
The plebeians had finally achieved political equality with the patricians.
However, the plight of the average plebeian had not changed. A small number of
plebeian families achieved the same standing that the old aristocratic
patrician families had always had, but the new plebeian aristocrats became as
uninterested in the plight of the average plebeian as the old patrician
aristocrats had always been. Supremacy of the New Nobility (287â€“133 BC). The
Hortensian Law deprived the patricians of their last weapon against the
plebeians, and thus resolved the last great political question of the era. No
such important political changes occurred between 287 BC and 133 BC. The
important laws of this era were still enacted by the senate. In effect, the
plebeians were satisfied with the possession of power, but did not care to use
it. The senate was supreme during this era because the era was dominated by
questions of foreign and military policy. This was the most militarily active
era of the Roman Republic. In the final decades of this era many plebeians grew
poorer. The long military campaigns had forced citizens to leave their farms to
fight, while their farms fell into disrepair. The landed aristocracy began
buying bankrupted farms at discounted prices. As commodity prices fell, many
farmers could no longer operate their farms at a profit. The result was the
ultimate bankruptcy of countless farmers. Masses of unemployed plebeians soon
began to flood into Rome, and thus into the ranks of the legislative
assemblies. Their poverty usually led them to vote for the candidate who
offered them the most. A new culture of dependency was emerging, in which
citizens would look to any populist leader for relief. From the Gracchi to
Caesar (133â€“49 BC). The prior era saw great military successes, and great
economic failures. The patriotism of the plebeians had kept them from seeking
any new reforms. Now, the military situation had stabilised, and fewer soldiers
were needed. This, in conjunction with the new slaves that were being imported
from abroad, inflamed the unemployment situation further. The flood of
unemployed citizens to Rome had made the assemblies quite populist. The
Gracchi. Tiberius Gracchus was elected tribune in 133 BC. He attempted to enact
a law which would have limited the amount of land that any individual could
own. The aristocrats, who stood to lose an enormous amount of money, were
bitterly opposed to this proposal. Tiberius submitted this law to the Plebeian
Council, but the law was vetoed by a tribune named Marcus Octavius. Tiberius
then used the Plebeian Council to impeach Octavius. The theory, that a
representative of the people ceases to be one when he acts against the wishes
of the people, was counter to Roman constitutional theory. If carried to its
logical end, this theory would remove all constitutional restraints on the
popular will, and put the state under the absolute control of a temporary
popular majority. His law was enacted, but Tiberius was murdered when he stood
for reelection to the tribunate. Tiberius' brother Gaius was elected tribune in
123 BC. Gaius Gracchus' ultimate goal was to weaken the senate and to
strengthen the democratic forces. In the past, for example, the senate would
eliminate political rivals either by establishing special judicial commissions
or by passing a "senatus consultum ultimum" ("ultimate decree of the senate").
Both devices would allow the Senate to bypass the ordinary due process rights
that all citizens had. Gaius outlawed the judicial commissions, and declared
the "senatus consultum ultimum" to be unconstitutional. Gaius then proposed a
law which would grant citizenship rights to Rome's Italian allies. By this
point, however, a part of Rome deserted him. He stood for election to a third
term in 121 BC, but was defeated and then murdered. The senate was weakened
significantly. The "populares" and the "optimates". In 118 BC, King Micipsa of
Numidia (current-day Algeria and Tunisia) died. He was survived by two
legitimate sons, Adherbal and Hiempsal, and an illegitimate son, Jugurtha.
Micipsa divided his kingdom between these three sons. Jugurtha, however, turned
on his brothers, killing Hiempsal and driving Adherbal out of Numidia. Adherbal
fled to Rome for assistance, and initially Rome mediated a division of the
country between the two brothers. Eventually, Jugurtha renewed his offensive,
leading to a long and inconclusive war with Rome. He also bribed several Roman
commanders, and at least two tribunes, before and during the war. His nemesis,
Gaius Marius, a legate from a virtually unknown provincial family, returned
from the war in Numidia and was elected consul in 107 BC over the objections of
the aristocratic senators. Marius invaded Numidia and brought the war to a
quick end, capturing Jugurtha in the process. The apparent incompetence of the
Senate, and the brilliance of Marius, had been put on full display. The
"populares" party took full advantage of this opportunity by allying itself
with Marius. Several years later, in 88 BC, a Roman army was sent to put down
an emerging Asian power, king Mithridates of Pontus. The army, however, was
defeated. One of Marius' old quaestors, Lucius Cornelius Sulla, had been
elected consul for the year, and was ordered by the senate to assume command of
the war against Mithridates. Marius, a member of the ""populares"" party, had a
tribune revoke Sulla's command of the war against Mithridates. Sulla, a member
of the aristocratic (""optimates"") party, brought his army back to Italy and
marched on Rome. Sulla was so angry at Marius' tribune that he passed a law
intended to permanently weaken the tribunate. He then returned to his war
against Mithridates. With Sulla gone, the "populares" under Marius and Lucius
Cornelius Cinna soon took control of the city. During the period in which the
"populares" party controlled the city, they flouted convention by re-electing
Marius consul several times without observing the customary ten year interval
between offices. They also transgressed the established oligarchy by advancing
unelected individuals to magisterial office, and by substituting magisterial
edicts for popular legislation. Sulla soon made peace with Mithridates. In 83
BC, he returned to Rome, overcame all resistance, and recaptured the city.
Sulla and his supporters then slaughtered most of Marius' supporters. Sulla,
having observed the violent results of radical "popular" reforms, was naturally
conservative. As such, he sought to strengthen the aristocracy, and by
extension the senate. Sulla made himself dictator, passed a series of
constitutional reforms, resigned the dictatorship, and served one last term as
consul. He died in 78 BC. Pompey, Crassus and the Catilinarian Conspiracy. In
77 BC, the senate sent one of Sulla's former lieutenants, Gnaeus Pompeius
Magnus ("Pompey the Great"), to put down an uprising in Spain. By 71 BC, Pompey
returned to Rome after having completed his mission. Around the same time,
another of Sulla's former lieutenants, Marcus Licinius Crassus, had just put
down the Spartacus led gladiator/slave revolt in Italy. Upon their return,
Pompey and Crassus found the "populares" party fiercely attacking Sulla's
constitution. They attempted to forge an agreement with the "populares" party.
If both Pompey and Crassus were elected consul in 70 BC, they would dismantle
the more obnoxious components of Sulla's constitution. The two were soon
elected, and quickly dismantled most of Sulla's constitution. Around 66 BC, a
movement to use constitutional, or at least peaceful, means to address the
plight of various classes began. After several failures, the movement's leaders
decided to use any means that were necessary to accomplish their goals. The
movement coalesced under an aristocrat named Lucius Sergius Catilina. The
movement was based in the town of Faesulae, which was a natural hotbed of
agrarian agitation. The rural malcontents were to advance on Rome, and be aided
by an uprising within the city. After assassinating the consuls and most of the
senators, Catiline would be free to enact his reforms. The conspiracy was set
in motion in 63 BC. The consul for the year, Marcus Tullius Cicero, intercepted
messages that Catiline had sent in an attempt to recruit more members. As a
result, the top conspirators in Rome (including at least one former consul)
were executed by authorisation (of dubious constitutionality) of the senate,
and the planned uprising was disrupted. Cicero then sent an army, which cut
Catiline's forces to pieces. The most important result of the Catilinarian
conspiracy was that the "populares" party became discredited. The prior 70
years had witnessed a gradual erosion in senatorial powers. The violent nature
of the conspiracy, in conjunction with the senate's skill in disrupting it, did
a great deal to repair the senate's image. First Triumvirate. In 62 BC, Pompey
returned victorious from Asia. The Senate, elated by its successes against
Catiline, refused to ratify the arrangements that Pompey had made. Pompey, in
effect, became powerless. Thus, when Julius Caesar returned from a governorship
in Spain in 61 BC, he found it easy to make an arrangement with Pompey. Caesar
and Pompey, along with Crassus, established a private agreement, now known as
the First Triumvirate. Under the agreement, Pompey's arrangements would be
ratified. Caesar would be elected consul in 59 BC, and would then serve as
governor of Gaul for five years. Crassus was promised a future consulship.
Caesar became consul in 59 BC. His colleague, Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus, was an
extreme aristocrat. Caesar submitted the laws that he had promised Pompey to
the assemblies. Bibulus attempted to obstruct the enactment of these laws, and
so Caesar used violent means to ensure their passage. Caesar was then made
governor of three provinces. He facilitated the election of the former
patrician Publius Clodius Pulcher to the tribunate for 58 BC. Clodius set about
depriving Caesar's senatorial enemies of two of their more obstinate leaders in
Cato and Cicero. Clodius was a bitter opponent of Cicero because Cicero had
testified against him in a sacrilege case. Clodius attempted to try Cicero for
executing citizens without a trial during the Catiline conspiracy, resulting in
Cicero going into self-imposed exile and his house in Rome being burnt down.
Clodius also passed a bill that forced Cato to lead the invasion of Cyprus
which would keep him away from Rome for some years. Clodius also passed a bill
that gave the populace a free grain dole, which had previously just been
subsidised. The end of the First Triumvirate. Clodius formed armed gangs that
terrorised the city and eventually began to attack Pompey's followers, who in
response funded counter-gangs formed by Titus Annius Milo. The political
alliance of the triumvirate was crumbling. Domitius Ahenobarbus ran for the
consulship in 55 BC promising to take Caesar's command from him. Eventually,
the triumvirate was renewed at Lucca. Pompey and Crassus were promised the
consulship in 55 BC, and Caesar's term as governor was extended for five years.
Crassus led an ill-fated expedition with legions led by his son, Caesar's
lieutenant, against the Kingdom of Parthia. This resulted in his defeat and
death at the Battle of Carrhae. Finally, Pompey's wife, Julia, who was Caesar's
daughter, died in childbirth. This event severed the last remaining bond
between Pompey and Caesar. Beginning in the summer of 54 BC, a wave of
political corruption and violence swept Rome. This chaos reached a climax in
January of 52 BC, when Clodius was murdered in a gang war by Milo. On 1 January
of 49 BC, an agent of Caesar presented an ultimatum to the senate. The
ultimatum was rejected, and the senate then passed a resolution which declared
that if Caesar did not lay down his arms by July of that year, he would be
considered an enemy of the Republic. On 7 January of 49 BC, the senate passed a
"senatus consultum ultimum", which vested Pompey with dictatorial powers.
Pompey's army, however, was composed largely of untested conscripts. On 10
January, Caesar crossed the Rubicon with his veteran army (in violation of
Roman laws) and marched towards Rome. Caesar's rapid advance forced Pompey, the
consuls and the Senate to abandon Rome for Greece. Caesar entered the city
unopposed. The period of transition (49â€“29 BC). The era that began when
Julius Caesar crossed the Rubicon in 49 BC and ended when Octavian returned to
Rome after Actium in 29 BC, saw the constitutional evolution of the prior
century accelerate at a rapid pace. By 29 BC, Rome had completed its transition
from being a city-state with a network of dependencies, to being the capital of
a world empire. With Pompey defeated and order restored, Caesar wanted to
ensure that his control over the government was undisputed. The powers which he
would give himself would ultimately be used by his imperial successors. He
would assume these powers by increasing his own authority, and by decreasing
the authority of Rome's other political institutions. Caesar would hold both
the dictatorship and the tribunate, but alternated between the consulship and
the proconsulship. In 48 BC, Caesar was given permanent tribunician powers.
This made his person sacrosanct, gave him the power to veto the senate, and
allowed him to dominate the Plebeian Council. In 46 BC, Caesar was given
censorial powers, which he used to fill the senate with his own partisans.
Caesar then raised the membership of the Senate to 900. This robbed the
senatorial aristocracy of its prestige, and made it increasingly subservient to
him. While the assemblies continued to meet, he submitted all candidates to the
assemblies for election, and all bills to the assemblies for enactment. Thus,
the assemblies became powerless and were unable to oppose him. Near the end of
his life, Caesar began to prepare for a war against the Parthian Empire. Since
his absence from Rome would limit his ability to install his own consuls, he
passed a law which allowed him to appoint all magistrates in 43 BC, and all
consuls and tribunes in 42 BC. This, in effect, transformed the magistrates
from being representatives of the people to being representatives of the
dictator. Caesar's assassination and the Second Triumvirate. Caesar was
assassinated in on March 15, 44 BC. The assassination was led by Gaius Cassius
and Marcus Brutus. Most of the conspirators were senators, who had a variety of
economic, political, or personal motivations for carrying out the
assassination. Many were afraid that Caesar would soon resurrect the monarchy
and declare himself king. Others feared loss of property or prestige as Caesar
carried out his land reforms in favor of the landless classes. Virtually all
the conspirators fled the city after Caesar's death in fear of retaliation. The
civil war that followed destroyed what was left of the Republic. After the
assassination, Mark Antony formed an alliance with Caesar's adopted son and
great-nephew, Gaius Octavian. Along with Marcus Lepidus, they formed an
alliance known as the Second Triumvirate. They held powers that were nearly
identical to the powers that Caesar had held under his constitution. As such,
the Senate and assemblies remained powerless, even after Caesar had been
assassinated. The conspirators were then defeated at the Battle of Philippi in
42 BC. Eventually, however, Antony and Octavian fought against each other in
one last battle. Antony was defeated in the naval Battle of Actium in 31 BC,
and he committed suicide with his love, Cleopatra. In 29 BC, Octavian returned
to Rome as the unchallenged master of the Empire and later accepted the title
of Augustus- "Exalted One" . Culture. Life in the Roman Republic revolved
around the city of Rome, and its famed seven hills. The city also had several
theatres, gymnasiums, and many taverns, baths and brothels. Throughout the
territory under Rome's control, residential architecture ranged from very
modest houses to country villas, and in the capital city of Rome, to the
residences on the elegant Palatine Hill, from which the word ""palace"" is
derived. The vast majority of the population lived in the city center, packed
into apartment blocks. Most Roman towns and cities had a forum and temples, as
did the city of Rome itself. Aqueducts brought water to urban centers and wine
and cooking oil were imported from abroad. Landlords generally resided in
cities and left their estates in the care of farm managers. To stimulate a
higher labour productivity, many landlords freed large numbers of slaves.
Beginning in the middle of the 2nd century BC, Greek culture was increasingly
ascendant, in spite of tirades against the "softening" effects of Hellenised
culture. By the time of Augustus, cultured Greek household slaves taught the
Roman young (sometimes even the girls). Greek sculptures adorned Hellenistic
landscape gardening on the Palatine or in the villas, and much Roman cuisine
was essentially Greek. Roman writers disdained Latin for a cultured Greek
style. Social history and structure. Many aspects of Roman culture were
borrowed from the Greeks. In architecture and sculpture, the difference between
Greek models and Roman paintings are apparent. The chief Roman contributions to
architecture were the arch and the dome. Rome has also had a tremendous impact
on European cultures following it. Its significance is perhaps best reflected
in its endurance and influence, as is seen in the longevity and lasting
importance of works of Virgil and Ovid. Latin, the Republic's primary language,
remains used for liturgical purposes by the Roman Catholic Church, and up to
the 19th century was used extensively in scholarly writings in, for example,
science and mathematics. Roman law laid the foundations for the laws of many
European countries and their colonies. The center of the early social structure
was the family, which was not only marked by blood relations but also by the
legally constructed relation of patria potestas. The Pater familias was the
absolute head of the family; he was the master over his wife, his children, the
wives of his sons, the nephews, the slaves and the freedmen, disposing of them
and of their goods at will, even putting them to death. Roman law recognised
only patrician families as legal entities. Slavery and slaves were part of the
social order; there were slave markets where they could be bought and sold.
Many slaves were freed by the masters for services rendered; some slaves could
save money to buy their freedom. Generally, mutilation and murder of slaves was
prohibited by legislation. It is estimated that over 25% of the Roman
population was enslaved. Clothing and dining. Men typically wore a toga, and
women a stola. The woman's "stola" differed in looks from a toga, and was
usually brightly coloured. The cloth and the dress distinguished one class of
people from the other class. The tunic worn by plebeians, or common people,
like shepherds and slaves, was made from coarse and dark material, whereas the
tunic worn by patricians was of linen or white wool. A knight or magistrate
would wear an "augusticlavus", a tunic bearing small purple studs. Senators
wore tunics with broad red stripes, called "tunica laticlavia". Military tunics
were shorter than the ones worn by civilians. Boys, up until the festival of
Liberalia, wore the "toga praetexta", which was a toga with a crimson or purple
border. The "toga virilis", (or "toga pura") was worn by men over the age of 16
to signify their citizenship in Rome. The "toga picta" was worn by triumphant
generals and had embroidery of their skill on the battlefield. The "toga pulla"
was worn when in mourning. Even footwear indicated a person's social status.
Patricians wore red and orange sandals, senators had brown footwear, consuls
had white shoes, and soldiers wore heavy boots. The Romans also invented socks
for those soldiers required to fight on the northern frontiers, sometimes worn
in sandals. Romans had simple food habits. Staple food was generally consumed
at around 11 o'clock, and consisted of bread, salad, cheese, fruits, nuts, and
cold meat left over from the dinner the night before. The Roman poet, Horace
mentions another Roman favorite, the olive, in reference to his own diet, which
he describes as very simple: "As for me, olives, endives, and smooth mallows
provide sustenance." The family ate together, sitting on stools around a table.
Fingers were used to eat solid foods and spoons were used for soups. Wine was
considered a staple drink, consumed at all meals and occasions by all classes
and was quite cheap. Cato the Elder once advised cutting his rations in half to
conserve wine for the workforce. Many types of drinks involving grapes and
honey were consumed as well. Drinking on an empty stomach was regarded as
boorish and a sure sign for alcoholism, the debilitating physical and
psychological effects of which were known to the Romans. An accurate accusation
of being an alcoholic was an effective way to discredit political rivals.
Prominent Roman alcoholics included Mark Antony, and Cicero's own son Marcus
(Cicero Minor). Even Cato the Younger was known to be a heavy drinker.
Education and language. Following various military conquests in the Greek East,
Romans adapted a number of Greek educational precepts to their own fledgling
system. Physical training to prepare the boys to grow as Roman citizens and for
eventual recruitment into the army. Conforming to discipline was a point of
great emphasis. Girls generally received instruction from their mothers in the
art of spinning, weaving, and sewing. Schooling in a more formal sense was
begun around 200 BC. Education began at the age of around six, and in the next
six to seven years, boys and girls were expected to learn the basics of
reading, writing and counting. By the age of twelve, they would be learning
Latin, Greek, grammar and literature, followed by training for public speaking.
Oratory was an art to be practiced and learnt, and good orators commanded
respect. The native language of the Romans was Latin. Although surviving Latin
literature consists almost entirely of Classical Latin, an artificial and
highly stylised and polished literary language from the 1st century BC, the
actual spoken language was Vulgar Latin, which significantly differed from
Classical Latin in grammar, vocabulary, and eventually pronunciation. Rome's
expansion spread Latin throughout Europe, and over time Vulgar Latin evolved
and dialectised in different locations, gradually shifting into a number of
distinct Romance languages. Many of these languages, including French, Italian,
Portuguese, Romanian and Spanish, flourished, the differences between them
growing greater over time. Although English is Germanic rather than Roman in
origin, English borrows heavily from Latin and Latin-derived words. The arts.
Roman literature was from its very inception influenced heavily by Greek
authors. Some of the earliest works we possess are of historical epics telling
the early military history of Rome. As the republic expanded, authors began to
produce poetry, comedy, history, and tragedy. Virgil represents the pinnacle of
Roman epic poetry. His "Aeneid" tells the story of flight of Aeneas from Troy
and his settlement of the city that would become Rome. Lucretius, in his "On
the Nature of Things", attempted to explicate science in an epic poem. The
genre of satire was common in Rome, and satires were written by, among others,
Juvenal and Persius. The rhetorical works of Cicero are considered to be some
of the best bodies of correspondence recorded in antiquity. In the 3rd century
BC, Greek art taken as booty from wars became popular, and many Roman homes
were decorated with landscapes by Greek artists. Portrait sculpture during the
period utilised youthful and classical proportions, evolving later into a
mixture of realism and idealism. Advancements were also made in relief
sculptures, often depicting Roman victories. Music was a major part of everyday
life. The word itself derives from Greek "Î¼Î¿Ï…ÏƒÎ¹ÎºÎ®" ("mousike"), "(art)
of the Muses". Many private and public events were accompanied by music,
ranging from nightly dining to military parades and manoeuvres. In a discussion
of any ancient music, however, non-specialists and even many musicians have to
be reminded that much of what makes our modern music familiar to us is the
result of developments only within the last 1,000 years; thus, our ideas of
melody, scales, harmony, and even the instruments we use would not be familiar
to Romans who made and listened to music many centuries earlier. Over time,
Roman architecture was modified as their urban requirements changed, and the
civil engineering and building construction technology became developed and
refined. The Roman concrete has remained a riddle, and even after more than
2,000 years some Roman structures still stand magnificently. The architectural
style of the capital city was emulated by other urban centers under Roman
control and influence. Roman cities were well planned, efficiently managed and
neatly maintained. Sports and entertainment. The city of Rome had a place
called the Campus Martius ("Field of Mars"), which was a sort of drill ground
for Roman soldiers. Later, the Campus became Rome's track and field playground.
In the campus, the youth assembled to play and exercise, which included
jumping, wrestling, boxing and racing. Equestrian sports, throwing, and
swimming were also preferred physical activities. In the countryside, pastime
included fishing and hunting. Board games played in Rome included dice
(Tesserae or Tali), Roman Chess (Latrunculi), Roman Checkers (Calculi), Tic-
tac-toe (Terni Lapilli), and Ludus duodecim scriptorum and Tabula, predecessors
of backgammon. There were several other activities to keep people engaged like
chariot races, musical and theatrical performances. Religion. Roman religious
beliefs date back to the founding of Rome, around 800 BC. However, the Roman
religion commonly associated with the republic and early empire did not begin
until around 500 BC, when Romans came in contact with Greek culture, and
adopted many of the Greek religious beliefs. Private and personal worship was
an important aspect of religious practices. In a sense, each household was a
temple to the gods. Each household had an altar ("lararium"), at which the
family members would offer prayers, perform rites, and interact with the
household gods. Many of the gods that Romans worshiped came from the Proto-
Indo-European pantheon, others were based on Greek gods. The two most famous
deities were Jupiter (the king God) and Mars (the god of war). With its
cultural influence spreading over most of the Mediterranean, Romans began
accepting foreign gods into their own culture, as well as other philosophical
traditions such as Cynicism and Stoicism. Military. Structural history. The
structural history of the Roman military describes the major chronological
transformations in the organisation and constitution of the Roman armed forces.
The Roman military was split into the Roman army and the Roman navy, although
these two branches were less distinct than they tend to be in modern defence
forces. Within the top-level branches of army and navy, structural changes
occurred both as a result of positive military reform and through organic
structural evolution. Hoplite armies (509â€“c. 315 BC). During this period,
Roman soldiers seem to have been modelled after those of the Etruscans to the
north, who themselves seem to have copied their style of warfare from the
Greeks. Traditionally, the introduction of the phalanx formation into the Roman
army is ascribed to the city's penultimate king, Servius Tullius (ruled 578 to
534 BC). According to Livy and Dionysius of Halicarnassus, the front rank was
composed of the wealthiest citizens, who were able to purchase the best
equipment. Each subsequent rank consisted of those with less wealth and poorer
equipment than the one before it. One disadvantage of the phalanx was that it
was only effective when fighting in large, open spaces, which left the Romans
at a disadvantage when fighting in the hilly terrain of central Italian
peninsula. In the 4th century BC, the Romans abandoned the phalanx in favour of
the more flexible manipular formation. This change is sometimes attributed to
Marcus Furius Camillus and placed shortly after the Gallic invasion of 390 BC;
it is more likely, however, that they were copied from Rome's Samnite enemies
to the south, possibly as a result of Samnite victories during the Second
Samnite War (326 to 304 BC). Manipular legion (c. 315â€“107 BC). During this
period, an army formation of around 5,000 men (of both heavy and light
infantry) was known as a legion. The manipular army was based upon social
class, age and military experience. "Maniples" were units of 120 men each drawn
from a single infantry class. The maniples were typically deployed into three
discrete lines based on the three heavy infantry types. Each first line maniple
were leather-armoured infantry soldiers who wore a bronze breastplate and a
bronze helmet adorned with 3 feathers approximately 30Â cm (12Â in) in height
and carried an iron-clad wooden shield. They were armed with a sword and two
throwing spears. The second infantry line was armed and armoured in the same
manner as was the first infantry line. The second infantry line, however, wore
a lighter coat of mail rather than a solid brass breastplate. The third
infantry line was the last remnant of the hoplite-style (the Greek-style
formation used occasionally during the early Republic) troops in the Roman
army. They were armed and armoured in the same manner as were the soldiers in
the second line, with the exception that they carried a lighter spear. The
three infantry classes may have retained some slight parallel to social
divisions within Roman society, but at least officially the three lines were
based upon age and experience rather than social class. Young, unproven men
would serve in the first line, older men with some military experience would
serve in the second line, and veteran troops of advanced age and experience
would serve in the third line. The heavy infantry of the maniples were
supported by a number of light infantry and cavalry troops, typically 300
horsemen per manipular legion. The cavalry was drawn primarily from the richest
class of equestrians. There was an additional class of troops who followed the
army without specific martial roles and were deployed to the rear of the third
line. Their role in accompanying the army was primarily to supply any vacancies
that might occur in the maniples. The light infantry consisted of 1,200
unarmoured skirmishing troops drawn from the youngest and lower social classes.
They were armed with a sword and a small shield, as well as several light
javelins. Rome's military confederation with the other peoples of the Italian
peninsula meant that half of Rome's army was provided by the Socii, such as the
Etruscans, Umbrians, Apulians, Campanians, Samnites, Lucani, Bruttii, and the
various southern Greek cities. Polybius states that Rome could draw on 770,000
men at the beginning of the Second Punic War, of which 700,000 were infantry
and 70,000 met the requirements for cavalry. Rome's Italian allies would be
organized in "alae", or "wings", roughly equal in manpower to the Roman
legions, though with 900 cavalry instead of 300. A small navy had operated at a
fairly low level after about 300 BC, but it was massively upgraded about forty
years later, during the First Punic War. After a period of frenetic
construction, the navy mushroomed to a size of more than 400 ships on the
Carthaginian ("Punic") pattern. Once completed, it could accommodate up to
100,000 sailors and embarked troops for battle. The navy thereafter declined in
size. The extraordinary demands of the Punic Wars, in addition to a shortage of
manpower, exposed the tactical weaknesses of the manipular legion, at least in
the short term. In 217 BC, near the beginning of the Second Punic War, Rome was
forced to effectively ignore its long-standing principle that its soldiers must
be both citizens and property owners. During the 2nd century BC, Roman
territory saw an overall decline in population, partially due to the huge
losses incurred during various wars. This was accompanied by severe social
stresses and the greater collapse of the middle classes. As a result, the Roman
state was forced to arm its soldiers at the expense of the state, which it had
not had to do in the past. The distinction between the heavy infantry types
began to blur, perhaps because the state was now assuming the responsibility of
providing standard-issue equipment. In addition, the shortage of available
manpower led to a greater burden being placed upon Rome's allies for the
provision of allied troops. Eventually, the Romans were forced to begin hiring
mercenaries to fight alongside the legions. The legion after the reforms of
Gaius Marius (107â€“27 BC). In a process known as the Marian reforms, Roman
consul Gaius Marius carried out a programme of reform of the Roman military. In
107 BC, all citizens, regardless of their wealth or social class, were made
eligible for entry into the Roman army. This move formalised and concluded a
gradual process that had been growing for centuries, of removing property
requirements for military service. The distinction between the three heavy
infantry classes, which had already become blurred, had collapsed into a single
class of heavy legionary infantry. The heavy infantry legionaries were drawn
from citizen stock, while non-citizens came to dominate the ranks of the light
infantry. The army's higher-level officers and commanders were still drawn
exclusively from the Roman aristocracy. Unlike earlier in the Republic,
legionaries were no longer fighting on a seasonal basis to protect their land.
Instead, they received standard pay, and were employed by the state on a fixed-
term basis. As a consequence, military duty began to appeal most to the poorest
sections of society, to whom a salaried pay was attractive. A destabilising
consequence of this development was that the proletariat "acquired a stronger
and more elevated position" within the state. The legions of the late Republic
were, structurally, almost entirely heavy infantry. The legion's main sub-unit
was called a "cohort" and consisted of approximately 480 infantrymen. The
cohort was therefore a much larger unit than the earlier "maniple" sub-unit,
and was divided into six centuries of 80 men each. Each century was separated
further into 10 "tent groups" of 8 men each. Legions additionally consisted of
a small body, typically 120 men, of Roman legionary cavalry. The cavalry troops
were used as scouts and dispatch riders rather than battlefield cavalry.
Legions also contained a dedicated group of artillery crew of perhaps 60 men.
Each legion was normally partnered with an approximately equal number of allied
(non-Roman) troops. However, the most obvious deficiency of the Roman army
remained its shortage of cavalry, especially heavy cavalry. As Rome's borders
expanded and its adversaries changed from largely infantry-based to largely
cavalry-based troops, the infantry-based Roman army began to find itself at a
tactical disadvantage, particularly in the East. After having declined in size
following the subjugation of the Mediterranean, the Roman navy underwent short-
term upgrading and revitalisation in the late Republic to meet several new
demands. Under Caesar, an invasion fleet was assembled in the English Channel
to allow the invasion of "Britannia"; under Pompey, a large fleet was raised in
the Mediterranean Sea to clear the sea of Cilician pirates. During the civil
war that followed, as many as a thousand ships were either constructed or
pressed into service from Greek cities. Campaign history. The core of the
campaign history of the Roman Republican military is the account of the Roman
military's land battles. Despite the encompassing of lands around the periphery
of the Mediterranean sea, naval battles were typically less significant than
land battles to the military history of Rome. As with most ancient
civilisations, Rome's military served the triple purposes of securing its
borders, exploiting peripheral areas through measures such as imposing tribute
on conquered peoples, and maintaining internal order. From the outset, Rome's
military typified this pattern and the majority of Rome's campaigns were
characterised by one of two types. The first is the territorial expansionist
campaign, normally begun as a counter-offensive, in which each victory brought
subjugation of large areas of territory. The second is the civil war, of which
examples plagued the Roman Republic in its final century. Roman armies were not
invincible, despite their formidable reputation and host of victories. Over the
centuries the Romans ""produced their share of incompetents"" who led Roman
armies into catastrophic defeats. Nevertheless, it was generally the fate of
even the greatest of Rome's enemies, such as Pyrrhus and Hannibal, to win the
battle but lose the war. The history of Rome's campaigning is, if nothing else,
a history of obstinate persistence overcoming appalling losses. Early Republic
(458â€“274 BC). Early Italian campaigns (458â€“396 BC). The first Roman
republican wars were wars of both expansion and defence, aimed at protecting
Rome itself from neighbouring cities and nations and establishing its territory
in the region. Initially, Rome's immediate neighbours were either Latin towns
and villages, or else tribal Sabines from the Apennine hills beyond. One by one
Rome defeated both the persistent Sabines and the local cities that were either
under Etruscan control or else Latin towns that had cast off their Etruscan
rulers. Rome defeated Latin cities in the Battle of Lake Regillus in 496 BC,
the Battle of Mons Algidus in 458 BC, the Battle of Corbione in 446 BC, the
Battle of Aricia, and an Etruscan city in the Battle of the Cremera in 477 BC,
By the end of this period, Rome had effectively completed the conquest of their
immediate Etruscan and Latin neighbours, as well as secured their position
against the immediate threat posed by the tribespeople of the nearby Apennine
hills. Celtic invasion of Italia (390â€“387 BC). By 390 BC, several Gallic
tribes had begun invading Italy from the north as their culture expanded
throughout Europe. The Romans were alerted of this when a particularly warlike
tribe invaded two Etruscan towns from the north. These two towns were not far
from Rome's sphere of influence. These towns, overwhelmed by the size of the
enemy in numbers and ferocity, called on Rome for help. The Romans met them in
pitched battle at the Battle of Allia River around 390â€“387 BC. The Gauls,
under their chieftain Brennus, defeated the Roman army of around 15,000 troops
and proceeded to pursue the fleeing Romans back to Rome itself and sacked the
city before being either driven off or bought off. Now that the Romans and
Gauls had bloodied one another, intermittent warfare was to continue between
the two in Italy for more than two centuries. The Celtic problem would not be
resolved for Rome until the final subjugation of all Gaul by Julius Caesar at
the Battle of Alesia in 52 BC. Roman expansion into Italia (343â€“282 BC).
After recovering surprisingly swiftly from the sack of Rome, the Romans
immediately resumed their expansion within Italy. The First Samnite War of
between 343 BC and 341 BC was a relatively short affair: the Romans beat the
Samnites in two battles, but were forced to withdraw from the war before they
could pursue the conflict further due to the revolt of several of their Latin
allies in the Latin War. Rome bested the Latins in the Battle of Vesuvius and
again in the Battle of Trifanum, after which the Latin cities were obliged to
submit to Roman rule. The Second Samnite War, from 327 BC to 304 BC, was a much
longer and more serious affair for both the Romans and Samnites. The fortunes
of the two sides fluctuated throughout its course. The Romans then proved
victorious at the Battle of Bovianum and the tide turned strongly against the
Samnites from 314 BC onwards, leading them to sue for peace with progressively
less generous terms. By 304 BC the Romans had effectively annexed the greater
degree of the Samnite territory, founding several colonies. Seven years after
their defeat, with Roman dominance of the area looking assured, the Samnites
rose again and defeated a Roman army in 298 BC, to open the Third Samnite War.
With this success in hand they managed to bring together a coalition of several
previous enemies of Rome. In the Battle of Populonia in 282 BC Rome finished
off the last vestiges of Etruscan power in the region. Pyrrhic War (280â€“275
BC). By the beginning of the 3rd century, Rome had established itself as a
major power on the Italian Peninsula, but had not yet come into conflict with
the dominant military powers in the Mediterranean Basin at the time: Carthage
and the Greek kingdoms. When a diplomatic dispute between Rome and a Greek
colony erupted into open warfare in a naval confrontation, the Greek colony
appealed for military aid to Pyrrhus, ruler of the northwestern Greek kingdom
of Epirus. Motivated by a personal desire for military accomplishment, Pyrrhus
landed a Greek army of some 25,000 men on Italian soil in 280 BC. Despite early
victories, Pyrrhus found his position in Italy untenable. Rome steadfastly
refused to negotiate with Pyrrhus as long as his army remained in Italy. Facing
unacceptably heavy losses with each encounter with the Roman army, Pyrrhus
withdrew from the peninsula (thus deriving the term "pyrrhic victory"). In 275
BC, Pyrrhus again met the Roman army at the Battle of Beneventum. While
Beneventum was indecisive, Pyrrhus realised his army had been exhausted and
reduced, by years of foreign campaigns, and seeing little hope for further
gains, he withdrew completely from Italy. The conflicts with Pyrrhus would have
a great effect on Rome. Rome had shown it was capable of pitting its armies
successfully against the dominant military powers of the Mediterranean, and
that the Greek kingdoms were incapable of defending their colonies in Italy and
abroad. Rome quickly moved into southern Italia, subjugating and dividing the
Greek colonies. Now, Rome effectively dominated the Italian peninsula, and won
an international military reputation. Mid-Republic (274â€“148 BC). Punic Wars
(264â€“146 BC). The First Punic War began in 264 BC when settlements on Sicily
began to appeal to the two powers between which they lay â€“ Rome and Carthage
â€“ to solve internal conflicts. The war saw land battles in Sicily early on,
but the theatre shifted to naval battles around Sicily and Africa. Before the
First Punic War there was no Roman navy to speak of. The new war in Sicily
against Carthage, a great naval power, forced Rome to quickly build a fleet and
train sailors. The first few naval battles were catastrophic disasters for
Rome. However, after training more sailors and inventing a grappling engine, a
Roman naval force was able to defeat a Carthaginian fleet, and further naval
victories followed. The Carthaginians then hired Xanthippus of Carthage, a
Spartan mercenary general, to reorganise and lead their army. He managed to cut
off the Roman army from its base by re-establishing Carthaginian naval
supremacy. With their newfound naval abilities, the Romans then beat the
Carthaginians in naval battle again at the Battle of the Aegates Islands and
leaving Carthage without a fleet or sufficient coin to raise one. For a
maritime power the loss of their access to the Mediterranean stung financially
and psychologically, and the Carthaginians sued for peace. Continuing distrust
led to the renewal of hostilities in the Second Punic War when Hannibal Barca
attacked a Spanish town, which had diplomatic ties to Rome. Hannibal then
crossed the Italian Alps to invade Italy. Hannibal's successes in Italy began
immediately, and reached an early climax at the Battle of Cannae, where 70,000
Romans were killed. In three battles, the Romans managed to hold off Hannibal
but then Hannibal smashed a succession of Roman consular armies. By this time
Hannibal's brother Hasdrubal Barca sought to cross the Alps into Italy and join
his brother with a second army. Hasdrubal managed to break through into Italy
only to be defeated decisively on the Metaurus River. Unable to defeat Hannibal
himself on Italian soil, the Romans boldly sent an army to Africa under Scipio
Africanus with the intention of threatening the Carthaginian capital. Hannibal
was recalled to Africa, and defeated at the Battle of Zama. Carthage never
managed to recover after the Second Punic War and the Third Punic War that
followed was in reality a simple punitive mission to raze the city of Carthage
to the ground. Carthage was almost defenceless and when besieged offered
immediate surrender, conceding to a string of outrageous Roman demands. The
Romans refused the surrender, and the city was stormed after a short siege and
completely destroyed. Ultimately, all of Carthage's North African and Spanish
territories were acquired by Rome. Kingdom of Macedonia, the Greek poleis, and
Illyria (215â€“148 BC). Rome's preoccupation with its war with Carthage
provided an opportunity for Philip V of the kingdom of Macedonia, located in
the north of the Greek peninsula, to attempt to extend his power westward.
Philip sent ambassadors to Hannibal's camp in Italy, to negotiate an alliance
as common enemies of Rome. However, Rome discovered the agreement when Philip's
emissaries were captured by a Roman fleet. The First Macedonian War saw the
Romans involved directly in only limited land operations, but they ultimately
achieved their objective of pre-occupying Philip and preventing him from aiding
Hannibal. Macedonia began to encroach on territory claimed by Greek city states
in 200 BC and these states pleaded for help from their newfound ally Rome. Rome
gave Philip an ultimatum that he must submit several parts of Greater Macedonia
to Rome and give up his designs on Greece. Philip refused, and Rome declared
war starting the Second Macedonian War. Ultimately, in 197 BC, the Romans
decisevely defeated Philip at the Battle of Cynoscephalae, subsequently
Macedonia was reduced to a central rump state. Rome now turned its attentions
to one of the Greek kingdoms, the Seleucid Empire, in the east. A Roman force
defeated the Seleucids at the Battle of Thermopylae and forced them to evacuate
Greece. The Romans then pursued the Seleucids beyond Greece, beating them in
the decisive engagement of the Battle of Magnesia. In 179 BC, Philip died and
his talented and ambitious son, Perseus, took his throne and showed a renewed
interest in Greece. Rome declared war on Macedonia again, starting the Third
Macedonian War. Perseus initially had some success against the Romans. However,
Rome responded by simply sending another stronger army. The second consular
army decisevely defeated the Macedonians at the Battle of Pydna in 168 BC and
the Macedonians duly capitulated, ending the Third Macedonian War. The Kingdom
of Macedonia was then divided by the Romans into four client republics. The
Fourth Macedonian War, fought from 150 BC to 148 BC, was fought against a
Macedonian pretender to the throne who was attempting to re-establish the old
Kingdom. The Romans swiftly defeated the Macedonians at the Second battle of
Pydna. The Achaean League chose this moment to rebel against Roman domination
but was swiftly defeated. Corinth was besieged and destroyed in 146 BC, the
same year as the destruction of Carthage, which led to the league's surrender.
Late Republic (147â€“30 BC). Jugurthine War (111â€“104 BC). The Jugurthine War
of 111â€“104 BC was fought between Rome and Jugurtha of the North African
kingdom of Numidia. It constituted the final Roman pacification of Northern
Africa, after which Rome largely ceased expansion on the continent after
reaching natural barriers of desert and mountain. Following Jugurtha's
usurpation of the throne of Numidia, a loyal ally of Rome since the Punic Wars,
Rome felt compelled to intervene. Jugurtha impudently bribed the Romans into
accepting his usurpation. Jugurtha was finally captured not in battle but by
treachery. The Celtic threat (121 BC) and the new Germanic threat (113â€“101
BC). In 121 BC, Rome came into contact with two Celtic tribes (from a region in
modern France), both of which they defeated with apparent ease. The Cimbrian
War (113â€“101 BC) was a far more serious affair than the earlier clashes of
121 BC. The Germanic tribes of the "Cimbri" and the "Teutons" migrated from
northern Europe into Rome's northern territories, and clashed with Rome and her
allies. At the Battle of Aquae Sextiae and the Battle of Vercellae both tribes
were virtually annihilated, which ended the threat. Internal unrest (135â€“71
BC). The extensive campaigning abroad by Roman generals, and the rewarding of
soldiers with plunder on these campaigns, led to a general trend of soldiers
becoming increasingly loyal to their generals rather than to the state. Rome
was also plagued by several slave uprisings during this period, in part because
vast tracts of land had been given over to slave farming in which the slaves
greatly outnumbered their Roman masters. In the last century BC at least twelve
civil wars and rebellions occurred. This pattern did not break until Octavian
(later "Caesar Augustus") ended it by becoming a successful challenger to the
Senate's authority, and was made "princeps" (emperor). Between 135 BC and 71 BC
there were three "Servile Wars" involving slave uprisings against the Roman
state. The third and final uprising was the most serious, involving ultimately
between 120,000 and 150,000 slaves under the command of the gladiator
Spartacus. Additionally, in 91 BC the Social War broke out between Rome and its
former allies in Italy over dissent among the allies that they shared the risk
of Rome's military campaigns, but not its rewards. Although they lost
militarily, the allies achieved their objectives with legal proclamations which
granted citizenship to more than 500,000 Italians. The internal unrest reached
its most serious state, however, in the two civil wars that were caused by the
consul Lucius Cornelius Sulla at the beginning of 82 BC. In the Battle of the
Colline Gate at the very door of the city of Rome, a Roman army under Sulla
bested an army of the Roman Senate and entered the city. Sulla's actions marked
a watershed in the willingness of Roman troops to wage war against one another
that was to pave the way for the wars which ultimately overthrew the Republic,
and caused the founding of the Roman Empire. Conflicts with Mithridates
(89â€“63 BC) and the Cilician pirates (67 BC). Mithridates the Great was the
ruler of Pontus, a large kingdom in Asia Minor (modern Turkey), from 120 to 63
BC. Mithridates antagonised Rome by seeking to expand his kingdom, and Rome for
her part seemed equally keen for war and the spoils and prestige that it might
bring. In 88 BC, Mithridates ordered the killing of a majority of the 80,000
Romans living in his kingdom. The massacre was the official reason given for
the commencement of hostilities in the First Mithridatic War. The Roman general
Lucius Cornelius Sulla forced Mithridates out of Greece proper, but then had to
return to Italy to answer the internal threat posed by his rival, Gaius Marius.
A peace was made between Rome and Pontus, but this proved only a temporary
lull. The Second Mithridatic War began when Rome tried to annex a province that
Mithridates claimed as his own. In the Third Mithridatic War, first Lucius
Licinius Lucullus and then Pompey the Great were sent against Mithridates.
Mithridates was finally defeated by Pompey in the night-time Battle of the
Lycus. The Mediterranean had at this time fallen into the hands of pirates,
largely from Cilicia. The pirates not only strangled shipping lanes but also
plundered many cities on the coasts of Greece and Asia. Pompey was nominated as
commander of a special naval task force to campaign against the pirates. It
took Pompey just forty days to clear the western portion of the sea of pirates
and restore communication between Iberia (Spain), Africa, and Italy. Caesar's
early campaigns (59â€“50 BC). During a term as praetor in the Iberian Peninsula
(modern Portugal and Spain), Pompey's contemporary Julius Caesar defeated two
local tribes in battle. Following his term as consul in 59 BC, he was then
appointed to a five-year term as the proconsular Governor of Cisalpine Gaul
(current northern Italy), Transalpine Gaul (current southern France) and
Illyria (the modern Balkans). Not content with an idle governorship, Caesar
strove to find reason to invade Gaul, which would give him the dramatic
military success he sought. When two local tribes began to migrate on a route
that would take them near (not into) the Roman province of Transalpine Gaul,
Caesar had the barely sufficient excuse he needed for his Gallic Wars, fought
between 58 BC and 49 BC. Caesar defeated large armies at major battles 58 BC
and 57 BC. In 55 and 54 BC he made two expeditions into Britain, becoming the
first Roman to do so. Caesar then defeated a union of Gauls at the Battle of
Alesia, completing the Roman conquest of Transalpine Gaul. By 50 BC, the
entirety of Gaul lay in Roman hands. Gaul never regained its Celtic identity,
never attempted another nationalist rebellion, and, other than the crisis of
the 3rd century, remained loyal to Rome until the fall of the western empire in
476. Triumvirates and Caesarian ascension (53â€“30 BC). By 59 BC an unofficial
political alliance known as the First Triumvirate was formed between Gaius
Julius Caesar, Marcus Licinius Crassus, and Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus ("Pompey the
Great") to share power and influence. In 53 BC, Crassus launched a Roman
invasion of the Parthian Empire (modern Iraq and Iran). After initial
successes, he marched his army deep into the desert; but here his army was cut
off deep in enemy territory, surrounded and slaughtered at the Battle of
Carrhae in which Crassus himself perished. The death of Crassus removed some of
the balance in the Triumvirate and, consequently, Caesar and Pompey began to
move apart. While Caesar was fighting in Gaul, Pompey proceeded with a
legislative agenda for Rome that revealed that he was at best ambivalent
towards Caesar and perhaps now covertly allied with Caesar's political enemies.
In 51 BC, some Roman senators demanded that Caesar not be permitted to stand
for consul unless he turned over control of his armies to the state, which
would have left Caesar defenceless before his enemies. Caesar chose civil war
over laying down his command and facing trial. By the spring of 49 BC, the
hardened legions of Caesar crossed the river Rubicon and swept down the Italian
peninsula towards Rome, while Pompey ordered the abandonment of Rome.
Afterwards Caesar turned his attention to the Pompeian stronghold of Iberia
(modern Spain) but decided to tackle Pompey himself in Greece. Pompey initially
defeated Caesar, but failed to follow up on the victory, and was decisively
defeated at the Battle of Pharsalus in 48 BC, despite outnumbering Caesar's
forces two to one, albeit with inferior quality troops. Pompey fled again, this
time to Egypt, where he was murdered. Pompey's death did not result in an end
to the civil war as Caesar's enemies were manifold and continued to fight on.
In 46 BC Caesar lost perhaps as much as a third of his army, but ultimately
came back to defeat the Pompeian army of Metellus Scipio in the Battle of
Thapsus, after which the Pompeians retreated yet again to Iberia. Caesar then
defeated the combined Pompeian forces at the Battle of Munda. Caesar was now
the primary figure of the Roman state, enforcing and entrenching his powers and
his enemies feared that he had ambitions to become an autocratic ruler. Arguing
that the Roman Republic was in danger a group of senators hatched a conspiracy
and murdered Caesar in the Senate in March 44 BC. Mark Antony, Caesar's
lieutenant, condemned Caesar's assassination, and war broke out between the two
factions. Antony was denounced as a public enemy, and Caesar's adopted son and
chosen heir, Gaius Octavian, was entrusted with the command of the war against
him. At the Battle of Mutina Antony was defeated by the consuls Hirtius and
Pansa, who were both killed. Octavian came to terms with Caesarians Antony and
Lepidus in 43 BC when the Second Triumvirate was formed. In 42 BC Triumvirs
Mark Antony and Octavian fought the Battle of Philippi with Caesar's assassins
Brutus and Cassius. Although Brutus defeated Octavian, Antony defeated Cassius,
who committed suicide. Brutus joined him shortly afterwards. However, civil war
flared again when the Second Triumvirate of Octavian, Lepidus and Mark Antony
failed. The ambitious Octavian built a power base of patronage and then
launched a campaign against Mark Antony. At the naval Battle of Actium off the
coast of Greece, Octavian decisively defeated Antony and Cleopatra. Octavian
was granted a series of special powers including sole "imperium" within the
city of Rome, permanent consular powers and credit for every Roman military
victory, since all future generals were assumed to be acting under his command.
In 27 BC Octavian was granted the use of the names "Augustus" and "Princeps"
indicating his primary status above all other Romans, and he adopted the title
"Imperator Caesar" making him the first Roman Emperor.
