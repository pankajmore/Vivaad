History of Asia The history of Asia can be seen as the collective history of
several distinct peripheral coastal regions such as, East Asia, South Asia, and
the Middle East linked by the interior mass of the Eurasian steppe. The coastal
periphery was the home to some of the world's earliest known civilizations,
with each of the three regions developing early civilizations around fertile
river valleys. These valleys were fertile because the soil there was rich and
could bear lots of root crops. The civilizations in Mesopotamia, the Indus
Valley, and China shared many similarities and likely exchanged technologies
and ideas such as mathematics and the wheel. Other notions such as that of
writing likely developed individually in each area. Cities, states and then
empires developed in these lowlands. The steppe region had long been inhabited
by mounted nomads, and from the central steppes they could reach all areas of
the Asian continent. The northern part of the continent, covering much of
Siberia was also inaccessible to the steppe nomads due to the dense forests and
the tundra. These areas in Siberia were very sparsely populated. The centre and
periphery were kept separate by mountains and deserts. The Caucasus, Himalaya,
Karakum Desert, and Gobi Desert formed barriers that the steppe horsemen could
only cross with difficulty. While technologically and culturally the city
dwellers were more advanced, they could do little militarily to defend against
the mounted hordes of the steppe. However, the lowlands did not have enough
open grasslands to support a large horsebound force. Thus the nomads who
conquered states in the Middle East were soon forced to adapt to the local
societies. 9000 BC to 4500 BC. A temple area in southeastern Turkey at G√∂bekli
Tepe dated to 10000 BC has been seen as the beginning of the "Neolithic 1"
culture. This site was developed by nomadic hunter-gatherers since there is no
permanent housing in the vicinity. This temple site is the oldest known man-
made place of worship. By 8500‚Äì8000 BC farming communities began to spread to
Anatolia, North Africa and north Mesopotamia. A report by archaeologist Rakesh
Tewari on Lahuradewa, India shows new C14 datings that range between 8000 BC
and 9000 BC associated with rice, making Lahuradewa the earliest Neolithic site
in entire South Asia. The prehistoric Beifudi site near Yixian in Hebei
Province, China, contains relics of a culture contemporaneous with the Cishan
and Xinglongwa cultures of about 7000‚Äì8000 BC, neolithic cultures east of the
Taihang Mountains, filling in an archaeological gap between the two Northern
Chinese cultures. The total excavated area is more than 1,200 square meters and
the collection of neolithic findings at the site consists of two phases. Around
5500 BCE the Halafian culture appeared in the Levant, Lebanon, Palestine,
Syria, Anatolia and northern Mesopotamia, based upon dryland agriculture. In
southern Mesopotamia were the alluvial plains of Sumer and Elam. Since there
was little rainfall irrigation systems were necessary. The Ubaid culture
flourished from 5500 BCE. Bronze Age (4500 BC‚Äì500 BC). The Chalcolithic
period began about 4500 BCE, then the Bronze Age began about 3500 BCE,
replacing the Neolithic cultures. The Indus Valley Civilization (IVC) was a
Bronze Age civilization (3300‚Äì1300 BCE; mature period 2600‚Äì1900 BCE) which
was centred mostly in the western part of the Indian Subcontinent, considered
as early form of Hinduism performed during this civilization. China and Vietnam
were also centres of metalworking. Dating back to the Neolithic Age, the first
bronze drums, called the Dong Son drums have been uncovered in and around the
Red River Delta regions of Vietnam and Southern China. These relate to the
prehistoric Dong Son Culture of Vietnam. Song Da bronze drum's surface, Dong
Son culture, Vietnam In Ban Chiang, Thailand (Southeast Asia), bronze artifacts
have been discovered dating to 2100 BC. In Nyaunggan, Burma bronze tools have
been excavated along with ceramics and stone artifacts. Dating is still
currently broad (3500‚Äì500 BC). Iron Age (500 BC‚Äì600). The Achaemenid
dynasty of the Persian Empire, founded by Cyrus the Great, ruled an area from
Greece and Turkey to the Indus River and Central Asia during the 6th to 4th
centuries BC. Alexander the Great conquered this empire in the 4th century BC.
The Roman Empire would later control parts of Western Asia. The Seleucid,
Parthian and Sassanian dynasties of Persia dominated Western Asia for
centuries. Foundation of the Maurya Empire(Sanskrit: ‡§Æ‡•å‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø
‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡§µ‡§Ç‡§∂, Maurya RƒÅjavan≈õha) which was geographically extensive and
powerful empire in ancient India, ruled by the Mauryan dynasty from 321 to 185
BC.It was one of the world's largest empires in its time. At its greatest
extent, the empire stretched to the north along the natural boundaries of the
Himalayas, and to the east stretching into what is now Assam. To the west, it
probably reached beyond modern Pakistan, annexing Balochistan and much of what
is now Afghanistan, including the modern Herat and Kandahar provinces. India
was united for the first time in the Maurya empire. The Gupta Empire (Sanskrit:
‡§ó‡•Å‡§™‡•ç‡§§ ‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡§µ‡§Ç‡§∂, Gupta RƒÅjavan≈õha) was an Ancient Indian
empire which existed approximately from 320 to 550 CE and covered much of the
Indian Subcontinent. Founded by Maharaja Sri-Gupta, the dynasty was the model
of a classical civilization.Maurya and Gupta empires are called as the Golden
Age of India and were marked by extensive inventions and discoveries in
science, technology, art, religion and philosophy that crystallized the
elements of what is generally known as Indian culture.The religions of Hinduism
and Buddhism, which began in India, were an important influence on South, East
and Southeast Asia The Qin Dynasty (Chinese: Áß¶Êúù; pinyin: Q√≠n Ch√°o) was
the first ruling dynasty of Imperial China, lasting from 221 to 206 BC. The Han
Dynasty (simplified Chinese: Ê±âÊúù; traditional Chinese: Êº¢Êúù; pinyin: H√ n
Ch√°o ;206 BCE ‚Äì 220 CE) was the second imperial dynasty of China, preceded
by the Qin Dynasty and succeeded by the Three Kingdoms (220‚Äì265 CE).Spanning
over four centuries, the period of the Han Dynasty is considered a golden age
in Chinese history.To this day, China's majority ethnic group refers to itself
as the "Han people". Many ancient civilizations were influenced by the Silk
Road, which connected China, India, the Middle East and Europe. Middle Ages
(600‚Äì1500). The Islamic Caliphate and other Islamic states took over the
Middle East, Caucasus and Central Asia during the Muslim conquests of the 7th
century, and later expanded into the Indian subcontinent and Malay archipelago.
The Mongol Empire conquered a large part of Asia in the 13th century, an area
extending from China to Europe. Marco Polo was not the first Westerner to
travel to the Orient and return with amazing stories of this different culture,
but his accounts published in the late 13th and early 14th centuries were the
first to be widely read throughout Europe. Chola Dynasty of south India,
annexed most of south-east Asia during 10th-11th century. The Muslim conquest
in the Indian subcontinent mainly took place from the 12th century onwards,
though earlier Muslim conquests made limited inroads into the region, beginning
during the period of the ascendancy of the Rajput Kingdoms in North India,
although Sindh and Multan were captured in 8th century.. Gunpowder was widely
used as early as the 11th century and they were using moveable type printing
five hundred years before Gutenberg created his press. Buddhism, Taoism,
Confucianism were the dominant philosophies of the Far East during the Middle
Ages. Medieval Asia was the kingdom of the Khans. Never before had any person
controlled as much land as Genghis Khan. He built his power unifying separate
Mongol tribes before expanding his kingdom south and west. He and his grandson,
Kublai Khan, controlled lands in China, Burma, Central Asia, Russia, Iran, the
Middle East, and Eastern Europe. Estimates are that the Mongol armies reduced
the population of China by nearly a third. Genghis Khan was a pagan who
tolerated nearly every religion, and their culture often suffered the harshest
treatment from Mongol armies. The Khan armies pushed as far west as Jerusalem
before being defeated in 1260. The Middle Ages were an unsurpassed era for
Chinese ceramics and painting. Medieval architectural masterpieces the Great
South Gate in Todaiji, Japan, and the Tien-ning Temple in Peking, China are
some of the surviving constructs from this era. The Black Death, which would
later ravage Western Europe had its beginnings in Asia, where it wiped out
large populations in China in 1331. China flourished again late in the medieval
era during the famed Ming Dynasty. In Japan these later Middle Age centuries
saw a return to the traditional Shinto faith and the continuing popularity of
Zen Buddhism. Modern period (1500‚Äìpresent). The Russian Empire began to
expand into Asia from the 17th century, eventually taking control of all of
Siberia and most of Central Asia by the end of the 19th century. The Ottoman
Empire controlled Anatolia, the Middle East, North Africa and the Balkans from
the 16th century onwards. In the 17th century, the Manchu conquered China and
established the Qing Dynasty, although this was in decline by the nineteenth
century and had been overthrown in 1912. In the 16th century, the Mughal Empire
controlled much of India and initiated second golden age for India. China was
largest economy in the world for much of the time followed by India till the
18th century. The riches of India,China and Ottoman blockading the route led to
discovery age in Europe which led to discovery of America,sea route to India
etc. The European powers had control of other parts of Asia by the 1900s, such
as British India, French Indochina, Spanish East Indies, and Portuguese Macau
and Goa. The Great Game between Russia and Britain was the struggle for power
in the Central Asian region in the nineteenth century. The Trans-Siberian
Railway, crossing Asia by train, was complete by 1916. Parts of Asia remained
free from European control, although not influence, such as Persia, Thailand
and most of China. In the twentieth century, Imperial Japan expanded into China
and Southeast Asia during the Second World War. After the war, many Asian
countries became independent from European powers. During the Cold War, the
northern parts of Asia were communist controlled with the Soviet Union and
People's Republic of China, while western allies formed pacts such as CENTO and
SEATO. Conflicts such as the Korean War, Vietnam War and Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan were fought between communists and anti-communists. In the decades
after the Second World War, a massive restructuring plan drove Japan to become
the world's second-largest economy, a phenomenon known as the Japanese post-war
economic miracle. The Arab-Israeli conflict has dominated much of the recent
history of the Middle East. After the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, there
were many new independent nations in Central Asia. Today China, India, South
Korea, Japan and Russia play important roles in world economics and
politics.China today is second largest economy of the world and fastest growing
economy. India is the second fastest growing economy with second largest
population after China.
