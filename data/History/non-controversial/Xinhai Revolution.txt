Xinhai Revolution The Xinhai Revolution, or the Hsin-hai Revolution, also known
as the Revolution of 1911 or the Chinese Revolution, was a revolution that
overthrew China's last imperial dynasty, the Qing Dynasty, and established the
Republic of China. The revolution was named Xinhai (Hsin-hai) because it
occurred in 1911, the year of the Xinhai stem-branch in the sexagenary cycle of
the Chinese calendar. The revolution consisted of many revolts and uprisings.
The turning point was the Wuchang Uprising on October 10, 1911, that was a
result of the mishandling of the Railway Protection Movement. The revolution
ended with the abdication of the "Last Emperor" Puyi on February 12, 1912, that
marked the end of over 2,000 years of imperial rule and the beginning of
China's republican era. The revolution arose mainly in response to the decline
of the Qing state, which had proven ineffective in its efforts to modernize
China and confront new challenges presented by foreign powers, and was
exacerbated by ethnic resentment against the ruling Manchu minority. Many
underground anti-Qing groups, with the support of Chinese revolutionaries in
exile, tried to overthrow the Qing. The brief civil war that ensued was ended
through a political compromise between Yuan Shikai, the late Qing military
strongman, and Sun Yat-sen, the leader of the Tongmenghui (United League).
After the Qing court transferred power to the newly founded republic, a
provisional coalition government was created along with the National Assembly.
However, political power of the new national government in Beijing was soon
thereafter monopolized by Yuan and led to decades of political division and
warlordism, including several attempts at imperial restoration. Today, both the
Republic of China in Taiwan and the People's Republic of China on the mainland
consider themselves to be successors to the Xinhai Revolution and continue to
pay homage to the ideals of the revolution including nationalism,
republicanism, modernization of China and national unity. October 10 is
commemorated in Taiwan as Double Ten Day, the National Day of the Republic of
China. In mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau, the same day is usually
celebrated as the Anniversary of the Xinhai Revolution. Many overseas Chinese
also celebrate the anniversary in Chinatowns across the world. Background.
After suffering its first defeat to the West in the First Opium War in 1842,
the Qing court struggled to contain foreign intrusions into China. Efforts to
adjust and reform the traditional methods of governance were constrained by a
deeply conservative court culture where ethnic Manchu rulers did not want to
give too much authority to the Han Chinese majority. In the wars against the
Taiping (1851â€“64), Nian (1851â€“1868), Muslims of Yunnan (1856â€“1868) and
the Northwest (1862â€“1877), the traditional Manchu armies proved themselves
incompetent, and the court came to rely on local Han armies. Following defeat
in the Second Opium War, the Qing tried to modernize by adopting certain
Western technologies through the Self-Strengthening Movement from 1861. In
1895, China suffered a serious defeat during the First Sino-Japanese War. This
demonstrated that traditional Chinese feudal society also needed to be
modernized if the technological and commercial advancements were to succeed. In
1898, Emperor Guangxu was guided by reformers like Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao
for a drastic reform in education, military and economy under the Hundred Days
Reforms. The reform was a failure, as it was ended prematurely by a
conservative coup led by Empress Dowager Cixi. Emperor Guangxu, who had always
been a puppet emperor dependent on Cixi, was put under house arrest in June
1898. Reformers Kang and Liang would be exiled. While in Canada, in June 1899,
they tried to form the Emperor Protection Society in an attempt to restore the
emperor. Empress Cixi mainly controlled the Qing dynasty from this point on.
The Boxer Rebellion prompted another foreign invasion of Beijing in 1900 and
the imposition of unequal treaty terms, which carved away territories, created
extraterritorial concessions and gave away trade privileges. Under internal and
external pressure, the Qing court began to adopt some of the reforms. The Qing
managed to maintain its monopoly on political power by suppressing, often with
great brutality, all domestic rebellions. Dissidents could operate only in
secret societies and underground organizations, in foreign concessions or in
exile overseas. Organization for revolution. Earliest groups. There were many
revolutionaries and groups that wanted to overthrow the Qing government to re-
establish a Han Chinese government. The earliest revolutionary organizations
were founded outside of China, such as Yeung Kui-wan's Furen Literary Society,
created in Hong Kong in 1890. There were fifteen members, including Tse Tsan-
tai, who did political satire such as "The Situation in the Far East", one of
the first ever Chinese manhua, and who later became one of the core founders of
the "South China Morning Post". Sun Yat-sen's Xingzhonghui (Revive China
Society) was established in Honolulu in 1894 with the main purpose of raising
funds for revolutions. The two organizations were merged in 1894. Smaller
groups. The Huaxinghui (China Revival Society) was founded in 1904 with
notables like Huang Xing, Zhang Shizhao, Chen Tianhua and Song Jiaoren, along
with 100 others. Their motto was "Take one province by force, and inspire the
other provinces to rise up". The Guangfuhui (Restoration Society) was also
founded in 1904, in Shanghai with Cai Yuanpei. Other notable members include
Zhang Binglin and Tao Chengzhang. Despite professing the anti-Qing cause, the
Guangfuhui was highly critical of Sun Yat-sen. One of the most famous female
revolutionaries was Qiu Jin, who fought for women's rights and was also from
Guangfuhui. There were also many other minor revolutionary organizations, such
as Lizhi Xuehui (å‹µå¿—å­¸æœƒ) in Jiangsu, Gongchanghui (å…¬å¼·æœƒ) in Sichuan,
Yiwenhui (ç›Šèæœƒ) and Hanzhudulihui (æ¼¢æ—ç¨ç«‹æœƒ) in Fujian, Yizhihui
(æ˜“çŸ¥ç¤¾) in Jiangxi, Yuewanghui (å²³ç‹æœƒ) in Anhui and Qunzhihui
(ç¾¤æ™ºæœƒ/ç¾¤æ™ºç¤¾) in Guangzhou. There were also criminal organizations that
were anti-Manchu, including the Green Gang and Hongmen Zhigongtang (è‡´å…¬å ‚).
Sun Yat-sen himself came in contact with the Hongmen, also known as Tiandihui
(Heaven and Earth society). Gelaohui (Elder Brother society) was another group,
with Zhu De, Wu Yuzhang, Liu Zhidan (åŠ‰å¿—ä¸¹) and Helong. This is the
revolutionary group that would eventually develop a strong link with the later
Communist Party. Tongmenghui. Sun Yat-sen successfully united the Revive China
Society, Huaxingwui and Guangfuhui in the summer of 1905, thereby establishing
the unified Tongmenghui (United League) in August 1905 in Tokyo. While it
started in Tokyo, it had loose organizations distributed across and outside the
country. Sun Yat-sen was the leader of this unified group. Other
revolutionaries who worked with the Tongmenghui include Wang Jingwei and Hu
Hanmin. When the Tongmenhui was established, more than 90% of the Tongmenhui
members were between 17 and 26 years of age. Some of the work in the era
includes manhua publications, such as the "Journal of Current Pictorial". Later
groups. In February 1906, Rizhihui (æ—¥çŸ¥æœƒ) also had many revolutionaries,
including Sun Wu (å­«æ­¦), Zhang Nanxian (å¼µé›£å…ˆ), He Jiwei and Feng Mumin.
A nucleus of attendees of this conference evolved into the Tongmenhui's
establishment in Hubei. In July 1907, several members of Tongmenhui in Tokyo
advocated a revolution in the area of the Yangtze River. Liu Quiyi (åŠ‰æ†ä¸€),
Jiao Dafeng (ç„¦é”å³°), Zhang Boxiang (å¼µä¼¯ç¥¥) and Sun Wu (å­«æ­¦)
established Gongjinhui (Progressive Association) (å…±é€²æœƒ). In January 1911,
the revolutionary group Zhengwu Xueshe (æŒ¯æ­¦å­¸ç¤¾) was renamed as Wenxueshe
(Literary society) (æ–‡å­¸ç¤¾). Jiang Yiwu (è”£ç¿Šæ­¦) was chosen as the
leader. These two organizations would play a big role in the Wuchang Uprising.
Views. Many revolutionaries promoted anti-Qing/anti-Manchu sentiments and
revived memories of conflict between the ethnic minority Manchu and the ethnic
majority Han Chinese from the late Ming Dynasty. Leading intellectuals were
influenced by books that had survived from the last years of the Ming Dynasty
(1368â€“1644), the last dynasty of Han Chinese. In 1904, Sun Yat-sen announced
that his organization's goal was "to expel the Tatar barbarians, to revive
Zhonghua, to establish a Republic, and to distribute land equally among the
people." (é©…é™¤éŸƒè™œ, æ¢å¾©ä¸­è¯, å‰µç«‹æ°‘åœ‹, å¹³å‡åœ°æ¬Š). Many of the
underground groups promoted the ideas of "Resist Qing and restore Ming"
(åæ¸…å¾©æ˜) that had been around since the days of the Taiping Rebellion.
Others, such as Zhang Binglin, supported straight-up lines like "slay the
manchus" and concepts like "Anti-Manchuism" (èˆˆæ¼¢æ»…èƒ¡ / æ’æ»¿ä¸»ç¾©).
Strata and groups. The Xinhai Revolution was supported by many groups,
including students and intellectuals who returned from abroad, as well as
participants of the revolutionary organizations, overseas Chinese, soldiers of
the new army, local gentry, farmers and others. Overseas Chinese. Assistance
from overseas Chinese was important in the Xinhai Revolution. In 1894, the
first year of the Revive China Society, the first meeting ever held by the
group was held in the home of Ho Fon, an overseas Chinese who was the leader of
the first Chinese Church of Christ. Overseas Chinese supported and actively
participated in the funding of revolutionary activities, especially the
Southeast Asia Chinese of Malaya (Singapore and Malaysia). Many of these groups
were reorganized by Sun, who was referred to as the "mother of the Chinese
revolution". Newly emerged intellectuals. In 1906, after the abolition of the
imperial examinations, the Qing government established many new schools and
encouraged students to study abroad. Many young people attended the new schools
or went abroad to study in places like Japan. A new class of intellectuals
emerged from those students, who contributed immensely to the Xinhai
Revolution. Besides Sun Yat-sen, key figures in the revolution, such as Huang
Xing, Song Jiaoren, Hu Hanmin, Liao Zhongkai, Zhu Zhixin and Wang Jingwei, were
all Chinese students in Japan. Some were young students like Zou Rong, known
for writing the book "Revolutionary Army", in which he talked about the
extermination of the Manchus for the 260 years of oppression, sorrow, cruelty
and tyranny and turned the sons and grandsons of Yellow Emperor into George
Washingtons. Before 1908, revolutionaries focused on coordinating these
organizations in preparation for uprisings that these organizations would
launch; hence, these groups would provide most of the manpower needed for the
overthrow of the Qing Dynasty. After the Xinhai Revolution, Sun Yat-sen
recalled the days of recruiting support for the revolution and said, "The
literati were deeply into the search for honors and profits, so they were
regarded as having only secondary importance. By contrast, organizations like
Sanhehui were able to sow widely the ideas of resisting the Qing and restoring
the Ming." Gentry and businessmen. The strength of the gentry in local politics
had become apparent. From December 1908, the Qing government created some
apparatus to allow the gentry and businessmen to participate in politics. These
middle-class people were originally supporters of constitutionalism. However,
they became disenchanted when the Qing government created a cabinet with Prince
Qing as prime minister. By early 1911, an experimental cabinet had thirteen
members, nine of whom were Manchus selected from the imperial family.
Foreigners. Besides Chinese and overseas Chinese, some of the supporters and
participants of the Xinhai Revolution were foreigners; among them, the Japanese
were the most active group. Some Japanese even became members of Tongmenghui.
Miyazaki Touten was the closest Japanese supporter; others included Heiyama Shu
and RyÅhei Uchida. British soldier Rowland J. Mulkern also took part in the
revolution. Some foreigners, such as English explorer Arthur de Carle Sowerby,
led expeditions to rescue foreign missionaries in 1911 and 1912. Soldiers of
the new armies. The New Army was formed in 1901 after the defeat of the Qings
in the First Sino-Japanese war. They were launched by a decree from eight
provinces. New Army troops were by far the best trained and equipped. The
recruits were of a higher quality than the old army and received regular
promotions. Beginning in 1908, the revolutionaries began to shift their call to
the new armies. Sun Yat-sen and the revolutionaries infiltrated the New Army.
Uprisings and incidents. The general focus of the uprisings were those that
surrounded the Tongmenghui and Sun Yat-sen, including the smaller groups
within. Some uprisings below involve groups that never merged with the
Tongmenghui. Sun Yat-sen may have participated in 8â€“10 uprisings; all
uprisings prior to the Wuchang Uprising had failed. First Guangzhou Uprising.
In the spring of 1895, the Revive China Society, which was based in Hong Kong,
planned the First Guangzhou Uprising (å»£å·èµ·ç¾©). Lu Haodong was tasked with
designing the revolutionaries' Blue Sky with a White Sun flag. On October 26,
1895, Yeung Kui-wan and Sun Yat-sen led Zhen Shiliang and Lu Haodong to
Guangzhou, preparing to capture Guangzhou in one strike. However, the details
of their plans were leaked to the Qing government. The government began to
arrest revolutionaries, including Lu Haodong, who was later executed. The first
Guangzhou uprising was a failure. Under pressure from the Qing government, the
government of Hong Kong forbade these two men to enter the territory for five
years. Sun Yat-sen went into exile, promoting the Chinese revolution and
raising funds in Japan, the United States, Canada and Britain. In 1901, Yeung
Kui-wan was assassinated by Qing agents in Hong Kong. After his death, his
family protected his identity by not putting his name on his tomb, just a
number: 6348. Independence Army Uprising. In 1900, after the Boxer Rebellion
started, Tang Caichang (å”æ‰å¸¸) and Tan Sitong of the previous Foot
Emancipation Society organised the Independence Army. The Independence Army
Uprising (è‡ªç«‹è»èµ·ç¾©) was planned to occur on August 23, 1900. Their goal
was to overthrow Empress Dowager Cixi to establish a constitutional monarchy
under Emperor Guangxu. Their plot was discovered by the governor general of
Hunan and Hubei. About twenty conspirators were arrested and executed. Huizhou
Uprising. On October 8, 1900, Sun Yat-sen ordered the launch of the Huizhou
Uprising (æƒ å·èµ·ç¾©). The revolutionary army was led by Zheng Shiliang and
initially included 20,000 men, who fought for half a month. However, after the
Japanese Prime Minister prohibited Sun Yat-sen from carrying out revolutionary
activities on Taiwan, Zheng Shiliang had no choice but to order the army to
disperse. This uprising therefore also failed. British soldier Rowland J.
Mulkern participated in this uprising. Great Ming Uprising. A very short
uprising occurred from January 25 to 28, 1903, to establish a "Great Ming
Heavenly kingdom" (å¤§æ˜é †å¤©åœ‹). This involved Tse Tsan-tai, Li Jitong
(æç´€å ‚), Liang Muguang (æ¢æ…•å…‰) and Hong Chunfu (æ´ªå…¨ç¦), who
formerly took part in the Jintian Uprising during the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom
era. Ping-liu-li Uprising. Ma Fuyi (é¦¬ç¦ç›Š) and Huaxinghui was involved in
an uprising in the three areas of Pingxiang, Liuyang and Liling, called "Ping-
liu-li Uprising", (èç€é†´èµ·ç¾©) in 1905. The uprising recruited miners as
early as 1903 to rise against the Qing ruling class. After the uprising failed,
Ma Fuyi was executed. Beijing Zhengyangmen East Railway assassination attempt.
Wu Yue (å³æ¨¾) of Guangfuhui carried out an assassination attempt at the
Beijing Zhengyangmen East Railway station (æ­£é™½é–€è»Šç«™) in an attack on
five Qing officials on September 24, 1905. Huanggang Uprising. The Huanggang
Uprising (é»ƒå²¡èµ·ç¾©) was launched on May 22, 1907, in Chaozhou. The
Revolutionary party, along with Xu Xueqiu (è¨±é›ªç§‹), Chen Yongpo (é™³æ¹§æ³¢)
and Yu Tongshi (ä½™é€šå¯¦), launched the uprising and captured Huanggang city.
Other Japanese that followed include (è±é‡é•·çŸ¥) and (æ± äº¨å‰). After the
uprising began, the Qing government quickly and forcefully suppressed it.
Around 200 revolutionaries were killed. Huizhou Seven Women Lake Uprising. In
the same year, Sun Yat-sen sent more revolutionaries to Huizhou to launch the
"Huizhou Seven Women Lake Uprising" (æƒ å·ä¸ƒå¥³æ¹–èµ·ç¾©). On June 2, Deng
Zhiyu (é„§å­ç‘œ) and Chen Chuan (é™³ç´”) gathered some followers, and
together, they seized Qing arms in the lake, from Huizhou. They killed several
Qing soldiers and attacked Taiwei (æ³°å°¾) on the 5th. The Qing army fled in
disorder, and the revolutionaries exploited the opportunity, capturing several
towns. They defeated the Qing army once again in Bazhiyie. Many organizations
voiced their support after the uprising, and the number of revolutionary forces
increased to two hundred men at its height. The uprising, however, ultimately
failed. Anqing Uprising. On July 6, 1907, Xu Xilin of Guangfuhui led an
uprising in Anqing, Anhui, which became known as the Anqing Uprising
(å®‰æ…¶èµ·ç¾©). Xu Xilin at the time was the police commissioner as well as the
supervisor of the police academy. He led an uprising that was to assassinate
the provincial governor of Anhui, En Ming (æ©éŠ˜). They were defeated after
four hours of fighting. Xu was captured, and En Ming's bodyguards cut out his
heart and liver and ate them. His cousin Qiu Jin was executed a few days later.
Qinzhou Uprising. From August to September 1907, the Qinzhou Uprising occurred
(æ¬½å·é˜²åŸèµ·ç¾©)., to protest against heavy taxation from the government.
Sun Yat-sen sent Wang Heshun (ç‹å’Œé †) there to assist the revolutionary army
and captured the county in September. After that, they attempted to besiege and
capture Qinzhou, but they were unsuccessful. They eventually retreated to the
area of Shiwandashan, while Wang Heshun returned to Vietnam. Zhennanguan
Uprising. On December 1, 1907, the Zhennanguan Uprising (é®å—é—œèµ·äº‹) took
place at Zhennanguan, a pass on the Chinese-Vietnamese border. Sun Yat-sen sent
Huang Mintang (é»ƒæ˜å ‚) to monitor the pass, which was guarded by a fort.
With the assistance of supporters among the fort's defenders, the
revolutionaries captured the cannon tower in Zhennanguan. Sun Yat-sen, Huang
Xing and Hu Hanmin personally went to the tower to command the battle. The Qing
government sent troops to counterattack, and the revolutionaries were forced to
retreat into mountainous areas. After the failure of this uprising, Sun was
forced to move to Singapore due to anti-Sun sentiments within the revolutionary
groups. He would not return to the mainland until after the Wuchang Uprising.
Qin-lian Uprising. On March 27, 1908, Huang Xing launched a raid, later known
as the Qin-lian Uprising (æ¬½å»‰ä¸Šæ€èµ·ç¾©), from a base in Vietnam and
attacked the cities of Qinzhou and Lianzhou in Guangdong. The struggle
continued for fourteen days but was forced to terminate after the
revolutionaries ran out of supplies. Hekou Uprising. In April 1908, another
uprising was launched in Yunnan, Hekou, called the Hekou Uprising
(é›²å—æ²³å£èµ·ç¾©). Huang Mingtang (é»ƒæ˜å ‚) led two hundred men from
Vietnam and attacked Hekou on April 30. Other revolutionaries who participated
include Wang Heshun (ç‹å’Œé †) and Guan Renfu (é—œä»ç”«). They were
outnumbered and defeated by government troops, however, and the uprising
failed. Mapaoying Uprising. On November 19, 1908, the Mapaiying Uprising
(é¦¬ç‚®ç‡Ÿèµ·ç¾©) was launched by revolutionary group Yuewanghui (å²³ç‹æœƒ)
member Xiong Chenggei (ç†ŠæˆåŸº) at Anhui. Yuewanghui, at this time, was a
subset of Tongmenghui. This uprising also failed. Gengxu New Army Uprising. In
February 1910, the Gengxu New Army Uprising (åºšæˆŒæ–°è»èµ·ç¾©), also known as
the Guangzhou New Army Uprising (å»£å·æ–°è»èµ·ç¾©), took place. This involved
a conflict between the citizens and local police against the New Army. After
revolutionary leader Ni Yingdian was killed by Qing forces, the remaining
revolutionaries were quickly defeated, causing the uprising to fail. Second
Guangzhou Uprising. On April 27, 1911, an uprising occurred in Guangzhou, known
as the Second Guangzhou Uprising (è¾›äº¥å»£å·èµ·ç¾©) or Yellow Flower Mound
Revolt (é»ƒèŠ±å²¡ä¹‹å½¹). It ended in disaster, as only 72 bodies were ever
found. The 72 revolutionaries were remembered as martyrs. Revolutionary Lin
Jue-min (æ—è¦ºæ°‘) was one of the 72. On the eve of battle, he wrote the
legendary "A Letter to My Wife" (èˆ‡å¦»è¨£åˆ¥æ›¸), later to be considered as a
masterpiece in Chinese literature. Wuchang Uprising. The Literary Society
(æ–‡å­¸ç¤¾) and the Progressive Association (å…±é€²æœƒ) were revolutionary
organizations involved in the uprising that mainly began with a Railway
Protection Movement protest. In the late summer, some Hubei New Army units were
ordered to neighboring Sichuan to quell the Railway Protection Movement, a mass
protest against the Qing government's seizure and handover of local railway
development ventures to foreign powers. Banner officers like Duanfang, the
railroad superintendent, and Zhao Erfeng led the New Army against the Railway
Protection Movement. The New Army units of Hubei had originally been the Hubei
Army, which had been trained by Qing official Zhang Zhidong. On September 24,
the Literary Society and Progressive Association convened a conference in
Wuchang, along with sixty representatives from local New Army units. During the
conference, they established a headquarters for the uprising. The leaders of
the two organizations, Jiang Yiwu (è”£ç¿Šæ­¦) and Sun Wu (å­«æ­¦), were elected
as commander and chief of staff. Initially, the date of the uprising was to be
October 6, 1911. It was postponed to a later date due to insufficient
preparations. Revolutionaries intent on overthrowing the Qing dynasty had built
bombs, and on October 9, one accidentally exploded. Sun Yat-sen himself had no
direct part in the uprising and was traveling in the United States at the time
in an effort to recruit more support from among overseas Chinese. The Qing
Viceroy of Huguang, Rui Cheng (ç‘æ¾‚), tried to track down and arrest the
revolutionaries. Squad leader Xiong Bingkun (ç†Šç§‰å¤) and others decided not
to delay the uprising any longer and launched the revolt on October 10, 1911,
at 7Â pm. The revolt was a success; the entire city of Wuchang was captured by
the revolutionaries on the morning of October 11. That evening, they
established a tactical headquarters and announced the establishment of the
"Military Government of Hubei of Republic of China". The conference chose Li
Yuanhong as the governor of the temporary government. Qing officers like the
bannermen Duanfang and Zhao Erfeng were killed by the revolutionary forces.
After Wuchang, echoes from other provinces. After the success of the Wuchang
Uprising, many other uprisings occurred in other cities and towns in other
provinces. Many of the uprisings were followed up with restorations (å…‰å¾©).
Some uprisings were more of a revolt for independence, and some were protests
or rebellions against local officials, but the outcome was that basically all
provinces in the country renounced the Qing dynasty and joined the Republic of
China. Changsha restoration. On October 22, 1911, the Hunan Tongmenghui were
led by Jiao Dafeng (ç„¦é”å¶§) and Chen Zuoxin (é™³ä½œæ–°). They headed an
armed group, consisting partly of revolutionaries from Hongjiang and partly of
defecting New Army units, in a campaign to extend the uprising into Changsha.
They captured the city and killed the local Imperial general. Then they
announced the establishment of the Hunan Military Government of the Republic of
China and announced their opposition to the Qing Empire. Shaanxi Uprising. On
the same day, Shaanxi's Tongmenghui, led by Jing Dingcheng (æ™¯å®šæˆ) and Qian
ding (éŒ¢é¼) as well as Jing Wumu (äº•å‹¿å¹•) and others including Gelaohui,
launched an uprising and captured Xi'an after two days of struggle. The Muslim
general Ma Anliang led more than twenty battalions of Hui Muslim troops to
defend the Qings and attacked Shaanxi, held by revolutionary Zhang Fenghui
(å¼µé³³ç¿½). The attack was successful, but when news arrived that the Qing
emperor Puyi was about to abdicate, Ma agreed to join the new Republic. The
revolutionaries established the "Qinlong Fuhan Military Government" and elected
Zhang Fenghui, a member of the Yuanrizhi Society (åŸæ—¥çŸ¥æœƒ), as new
governor. Xi'an Manchu city (æ»¿åŸ) finally fell on October 24, after a
massacre of its Manchu residents. Many of its Manchu defenders committed
suicide, including Qing general Wenrui (æ–‡ç‘), who threw himself down a well.
Jiujiang Uprising. On October 23, Lin Sen, Jiang Qun (è”£ç¾¤), Cai Hui (è”¡è•™)
and other members of the Tongmenghui in the province of Jiangxi plotted a
revolt of New Army units. After they achieved victory, they announced their
independence. The Jiujiang Military Government was then established. Shanxi
Taiyuan Uprising. On October 29, Yan Xishan of the New Army led an uprising in
Taiyuan, the capital city of the province of Shanxi, along with Yao Yijie
(å§šä»¥åƒ¹), Huang Guoliang (é»ƒåœ‹æ¢), Wen Shouquan (æº«å£½æ³‰), Li Chenglin
(ææˆæ—), Zhang Shuzhi (å¼µæ¨¹å¹Ÿ) and Qiao Xi (å–¬ç…¦). They managed to
kill the Qing Governor of Shanxi, Lu Zhongqi (é™¸é¾ç¦). They then announced
the establishment of Shanxi Military Government with Yan Xishan as the military
governor. Yan Xishan would later become one of the warlords that plagued China
during what was known as "the warlord era". Kunming Double Ninth Uprising. On
October 30, Li Genyuan (ææ ¹æº) of the Tongmenghui in Yunnan province joined
with Cai E, Luo Peijin (ç¾…ä½©é‡‘), Tang Jiyao, and other officers of the New
Army to launch the Double Ninth Uprising (é‡ä¹èµ·ç¾©). They captured Kunming
the next day and established the Yunnan Military Government, electing Cai E as
the military governor. Nanchang restoration. On October 31, the Nanchang branch
of the Tongmenghui led New Army units in a successful uprising. They
established the Jiangxi Military Government. Li Liejun was elected as the
military governor. Li declared Jiangxi as independent and launched an
expedition against Qing official Yuan Shikai. Shanghai Armed Uprising. On
November 3, Shanghai's Tongmenghui, Guangfuhui and merchants led by Chen Qimei,
Li Pingsu (æå¹³æ›¸), Zhang Chengyou (å¼µæ‰¿æ§±), Li Yingshi (æè‹±çŸ³), Li
Xiehe (æç‡®å’Œ) and Song Jiaoren organized an armed rebellion in Shanghai.
They received the support of local police officers. The rebels captured the
Jiangnan Workshop on the 4th and captured Shanghai soon after. On November 8,
they established the Shanghai Military Government and elected Chen Qimei as the
military governor. He would eventually become one of the founders of the ROC
four big families, along with some of the most well-known families of the era.
Guizhou Uprising. On November 4, Zhang Bailin (å¼µç™¾éºŸ) of the revolutionary
party in Guizhou led an uprising along with New Army units and students from
the military academy. They immediately captured Guiyang and established the
Great Han Guizhou Military Government, electing Yang Jincheng (æ¥Šè—èª ) and
Zhao Dequan (è¶™å¾·å…¨) as the chief and vice governor. Zhejiang Uprising. Also
on November 4, revolutionaries in Zhejiang urged the New Army units in Hangzhou
to launch an uprising. Zhu Rui (æœ±ç‘), Wu Siyu (å³æ€è±«), Lu Gongwang
(å•å…¬æœ›) and others of the New Army captured the military supplies workshop.
Other units, led by Chiang Kai-shek and Yin Zhirei (å°¹éŠ³å¿—), captured most
of the government offices. Eventually, Hangzhou was under the control of the
revolutionaries, and the constitutionist Tang Shouqian (æ¹¯å£½æ½›) was elected
as the military governor. Jiangsu restoration. On November 5, Jiangsu
constitutionists and gentry urged Qing governor Cheng Dequan (ç¨‹å¾·å…¨) to
announce independence and established the Jiangsu Revolutionary Military
Government with Cheng himself as the governor. Unlike some of the other cities,
anti-Manchu violence began after the restoration on November 7 in Zhenjiang.
Qing general Zaimu (è¼‰ç©†) agreed to surrender, but because of a
misunderstanding, the revolutionaries were unware that their safety was
guaranteed. The Manchu quarters were ransacked, and an unknown number of
Manchus were killed. Zaimu, feeling betrayed, committed suicide. This is
regarded as the Zhenjiang Uprising (é®æ±Ÿèµ·ç¾©). Anhui Uprising. Members of
Anhui's Tongmenghui also launched an uprising on that day and laid siege to the
provincial capital. The constitutionists persuaded Zhu Jiabao (æœ±å®¶å¯¶), the
Qing Governor of Anhui, to announce independence. Guangxi Uprising. On November
7, the Guangxi politics department decided to secede from the Qing government,
announcing Guangxi's independence. Qing Governor Shen Bingkun (æ²ˆç§‰å ƒ) was
allowed to remain governor, but Lu Rongting would soon become the new governor.
Lu Rongting would later rise to prominence during the "warlord era" as one of
the warlods, and his bandits controlled Guangxi for more than a decade. Fujian
independence. In November, members of Fujian's branch of the Tongmenghui, along
with Sun Daoren (å­«é“ä») of the New Army, launched an uprising against the
Qing army. The Qing viceroy, Song Shou (æ¾å£½), committed suicide. On November
11, the entire Fujian province declared independence. The Fujian Military
Government was established, and Sun Daoren was elected as the military
governor. Guangdong independence. Near the end of October, Chen Jiongming, Deng
Keng (é„§é—), Peng Reihai (å½­ç‘æµ·) and other members of Guangdong's
Tongmenghui organized local militias to launch the uprising in Huazhou, Nanhai,
Sunde and Sanshui in Guangdong Province. On November 8, after being persuaded
by Hu Hanmin, General Li Zhun (ææº–) and Long Jiguang (é¾æ¿Ÿå…‰) of the
Guangdong Navy agreed to support the revolution. The Qing viceroy of
Liangguang, Zhang Mingqi (å¼µé³´å²), was forced to discuss with the local
representatives a proposal for Guangdong's independence. They decided to
announce it the next day. Chen Jiongming then captured Huizhou. On November 9,
Guangdong announced its independence and established a military government.
They elected Hu Hanmin and Chen Jiongming as the chief and vice governor. Qiu
Fengjia is known to have helped make the independence declaration more
peaceful. Shandong independence. On November 13, persuaded by revolutionary Din
Weifen (ä¸æƒŸæ±¾) and several other officers of the New Army, the Qing
governor of Shandong, Sun Baoqi, agreed to secede from the Qing government and
announced Shandong's independence. Ningxia Uprising. On November 17, Ningxia
the Tongmenghui launched the Ningxia Uprising (å¯§å¤æœƒé»¨èµ·ç¾©). The
revolutionaries sent Yu Youren to Zhangjiachuan to meet Dungan Sufi master Ma
Yuanzhang to persuade him not to support the Qing. However, Ma did not want to
endanger his relationship with the Qings. He sent the eastern Gansu Muslim
militia under the command of one of his sons to help Ma Qi crush the Ningxia
Gelaohui. The Ningxia Revolutionary Military Government was established on
November 23. Some of the revolutionaries involved included Huang Yue (é»ƒé‰)
and Xiang Shen (å‘ç‡Š), who gathered New Army forces at Qinzhou (ç§¦å·).
Sichuan independence. On November 21, Guang'an organized the Great Han shu
northern Military Government. On November 22, Chengdu and Sichuan began to
declare independence. By the 27th, the Great Han Sichuan Military Government
was established, headed by revolutionary Pu Dianzun (è’²æ®¿ä¿Š). Qing official
Duan Fang (ç«¯æ–¹) would also be killed. Nanking Uprising. On November 8,
supported by the Tongmenghui, Xu Shaozhen (å¾ç´¹æ¥¨) of the New Army announced
an uprising in Molin Pass (ç§£é™µé—œ), away from Nanking City. Xu Shaozhen,
Chen Qimei and other generals decided to form a united army under Xu to strike
Nanking together. On November 11, the united army headquarters was established
in Zhenjiang. Between November 24 and December 1, under the command of Xu
Shaozhen, the united army captured Wulongshan (çƒé¾å±±), Mufushan
(å¹•åºœå±±), Yuhuatai (é›¨èŠ±è‡º), Tianbao City (å¤©ä¿åŸ) and many other
strongholds of the Qing army. On December 2, Nanking City was captured by the
revolutionaries after the Battle of Nanking. On December 3, revolutionary Su
Liangbi led troops in a massacre of a large number of Manchus (the exact number
is not known). He was shortly afterward arrested, and his troops disbanded.
Tibetan independence. In 1905, the Qing sent Zhao Erfeng to Tibet to retaliate
against rebellions. By 1908, Zhao was appointed imperial resident in Lhasa.
Zhao was beheaded in December 1911 by pro-Republican forces. The bulk of the
area that was historically known as Kham was now the Xikang Administrative
District, created by the Republican revolutionaries. By the end of 1912, the
last Manchu troops were escorted out of Tibet. Thubten Gyatso, the 13th Dalai
Lama, returned to Tibet in January 1913 from Sikkim, where he had been
residing. When the new ROC government apologised for the actions of the Qing
and offered to restore the Dalai Lama to his former position, he replied that
he was not interested in Chinese ranks, that Tibet had never been subordinated
to China, that Tibet was an independent country, and that he was assuming the
spiritual and political leadership of Tibet. Because of this, many have read
this reply as a formal declaration of independence. The Chinese side ignored
the response, and Tibet had thirty years free of interference from China.
Mongolian independence. At the end of 1911, the Mongols took action with an
armed revolt against the Manchu authorities but was unsuccessful in the
attempt. An independence movement took place that was not limited to just North
(outer) Mongolia but was a pan-Mongolian phenomenon. On December 29, 1911, Bogd
Khan became the leader of the Mongol empire. Inner Mongolia became a contested
terrain between Khan and the Republic. In general, Russia supported the
Independence of Outer Mongolia (including Tannu Uriankhai) during the time of
the Xinhai Revolution. Tibet and Mongolia then recognized each other in a
treaty. Dihua and Yili Uprising. In Xinjiang on December 28, Liu Xianzun
(åŠ‰å…ˆä¿Š) and the revolutionaries started the Dihua Uprising (è¿ªåŒ–èµ·ç¾©).
This was led by more than 100 members of Geilaohui. This uprising failed. On
January 7, 1912, the Yili Uprising (ä¼ŠçŠèµ·ç¾©) with Feng Temin (é¦®ç‰¹æ°‘)
began. Qing governor Yuan Dahua (è¢å¤§åŒ–) fled and handed over his
resignation to Yang Zengxin, because he could not handle fighting the
revolutionaries. In the morning of January 8, a new Yili government was
established for the revolutionaries, but the revolutionaries would be defeated
at Jinghe in January and February. Eventually because of the abdication to
come, Yuan Shikai recognized Yang Zengxin's rule, appointed him Governor of
Xinjiang and had the province join the Republic. Eleven more former Qing
officials would be assassinated in Zhenxi, Karashahr, Aqsu, Kucha, Luntai and
Kashgar in April and May 1912. Taiwan Uprising. In 1911 as part of the Xinhai
Revolution, Tongmenghui sent Luo Fu-xing (ç¾…ç¦æ˜Ÿ) to Taiwan island to free
it from being occupied by the Japanese. The goal was to bring Taiwan island
back to the Chinese Republic by having the Taiwan Uprising (å°ç£èµ·ç¾©). Luo
was caught and killed on March 3, 1914. What was left was known as the "Miaoli
incident", (è‹—æ —äº‹ä»¶) where more than 1,000 Taiwanese were executed by the
Japanese police. Luo's sacrifice is commemorated in Miaoli. Change of
government. North: Qing court last transformation attempt. On November 1, 1911,
the Qing government appointed Yuan Shikai as the prime minister of the imperial
cabinet, replacing Prince Qing. On November 3, the Qing court passed the
Nineteen Articles (æ†²æ³•é‡å¤§ä¿¡æ¢åä¹æ¢), which turned the Qing from an
autocratic system with the emperor having unlimited power to a constitutional
monarchy. On November 9, Huang Xing even cabled Yuan Shikai and invited him to
join the Republic. The court changes were too late, and the emperor was about
to have to step down. South: Government in Nanking. On November 28, 1911,
Wuchang and Hanyang had fallen back to the Qing army. So for safety, the
revolutionaries convened their first conference at the British concession in
Hankou on November 30. By December 2, the revolutionary forces were able to
capture Nanking in the uprising; the revolutionaries decided to make it the
site of the new provisional government. At the time, Beijing was still the Qing
capital. North-South Conference. On December 18, the North-South Conference
(å—åŒ—è­°å’Œ) was held in Shanghai to discuss the north and south issues. Yuan
Shikai selected Tang Shaoyi as his representative. Tang left Beijing for Wuhan
to negotiate with the revolutionaries. The revolutionaries chose Wu Tingfang.
With the intervention of six foreign powers, the UK, the US, Germany, Russia,
Japan, and France, Tang Shaoyi and Wu Tingfang began to negotiate a settlement
at the British concession. Foreign businessman Edward Selby Little (æå¾·ç«‹)
acted as the negotiator and facilitated the peace agreement. They agreed that
Yuan Shikai would force the Qing Emperor to abdicate in exchange for the
southern provinces' support of Yuan as the president of the Republic. After
considering the possibility that the new republic might be defeated in a civil
war or by foreign invasion, Sun Yat-sen agreed to Yuan's proposal to unify
China under Yuan Shikai's Beijing government. Further decisions were made to
let the emperor rule over his little court in the New Summer Palace. He would
be treated as a ruler of a separate country and have expenses of several
million taels in silver. Establishment of the Republic. Republic of China
declared and national flag issue. On December 29, 1911, Sun Yat-sen was elected
as the first provisional president. January 1, 1912, was set as the first day
of the First Year of the Republic of China. On January 3, the representatives
recommended Li Yuanhong as the provisional vice president. During and after the
Xinhai Revolution, many groups that participated wanted their own pennant as
the national flag. During the Wuchang Uprising, the military units of Wuchang
wanted the nine-star flag with Taijitu. Others in competition included Lu Hao-
tung's Blue Sky and White Sun flag. Huang Xing favored a flag bearing the
mythical "well-field" system of village agriculture. In the end, the assembly
compromised: the national flag would be the banner of Five Races Under One
Union. The Five Races Under One Union flag with horizontal stripes represented
the five major nationalities of the republic. The red represented Han, the
yellow represented Manchus, the blue for Mongols, the white for Tibetans, and
the black for Muslims. Despite the general target of the uprisings to be the
Manchus, Sun Yat-sen, Song Jiaoren and Huang Xing unanimously advocated racial
integration to be carried out from the mainland to the frontiers. Donghuamen
incident. On January 16, while returning to his residence, Yuan Shikai was
ambushed in a bomb attack organized by the Tongmenghui in Donghuamen
(æ±è¯é–€), Tientsin, Beijing. A total of eighteen revolutionaries were
involved. About ten of the guards died, but Yuan himself was not seriously
injured. He sent a message to the revolutionaries the next day pledging his
loyalty and asking them not to organize any more assassination attempts against
him. Abdication of the emperor. On January 20, Wu Tingfang of the Nanking
Provisional Government officially delivered the imperial edict of abdication to
Yuan Shikai the terms for the abdication of Qing Emperor Xuantong Puyi. It was
drafted by Zhang Jian, and was approved by the Provisional senate. On January
22, Sun Yat-sen announced that if Yuan Shikai supported the emperor's
abdication, he (Sun Yat-sen) would resign the presidency in favor of Yuan
Shikai. After Yuan received this promise, he sped up the process. He threatened
Empress Longyu that if the revolutionaries come to Beijing, the lives of the
royal family would not be spared, but if they agree to abdicate, the terms for
their abdication would be honored. On February 3, Empress Longyu gave Yuan
Shikai full permission to negotiate the terms for the abdication of the Qing
Emperor. Yuan then drew up his own version and forwarded it back to the
revolutionaries on February 3. His version consisted of three sections instead
of two. On February 12, 1912, after being persuaded and pressured by Yuan
Shikai and other ministers, Puyi (age six) and Empress Longyu accepted the
terms for the imperial family's abdication. Change of capital. Dong'anmen gate
incident. The revolutionaries were trying to lure Yuan Shikai to the South. By
making Yuan the president of the southern Nanking-based provisional government,
he would have to give up his military power base in the North. In February
1912, troops were looting shops and stealing from rich commercial areas. They
then burned down the Dong'anmen gate (æ±å®‰é–€) on the wall surrounding the
Imperial City. Thousands of people were killed. This mutiny was actually
ordered by Yuan and Cao Kun. Yuan intimidated the revolutionaries and made it
clear that the new government would have to go to him in Beijing; he was not
going to the South. This was an excuse to move the capital of the new republic
from Nanking back to Beijing. Government in Beijing. On March 10, 1912, Yuan
Shikai was sworn as the second Provisional President of the Republic of China
in Beijing. The government based in Beijing, called the Beiyang Government, was
internationally recognized as the legitimate government of the Republic of
China until 1928, so the period from 1912 until 1928 was known simply as the
"Beiyang Period". The first National Assembly election took place according to
the Provisional Constitution. While in Beijing, the Kuomintang (KMT) was formed
on August 25, 1912. The KMT won the majority seats after the election. Song
Jiaoren was elected as premier. However, Song was assassinated in Shanghai on
March 20, 1913, under the secret order of Yuan Shikai. Legacy. Social
influence. After the revolution, there was a huge outpouring of anti-Manchu
literature. One example is Wang Xiuchu's graphical account of the ten-day
Chinese massacre in Yangzhou. Others are "A Short History of Slaves"
(å¥´æ‰å°å²) and "The Biographies of Avaricious Officials and Corrupt
Personnel" (è²ªå®˜æ±¡åå‚³) by Laoli (è€å). Many other books were written
about the era. During the abdication of the last emperor, Empress Longyu, Yuan
Shikai and Sun Yat-sen both tried to adopt the concept of "Manchu and Han as
one family" (æ»¿æ¼¢ä¸€å®¶). People started exploring and debating with
themselves on the root cause of their national weakness. This new search of
identity was the New Culture Movement. Manchu culture and language, on the
contrary, has become virtually extinct by 2007. Unlike revolutions in the West,
the Xinhai Revolution did not restructure society. The participants of the
Xinhai Revolution were mostly military personnel, old-type bureaucrats, and
local gentries. These people still held regional power after the Xinhai
Revolution. Some became warlords. There were no major improvements in the
standard of living. Writer Lu Xun commented in 1921 during the publishing of
"The True Story of Ah Q", ten years after the Xinhai Revolution, that basically
nothing changed except "the Manchus have left the kitchen". The economic
problems were not addressed until Chiang Ching-kuo in Taiwan and Deng Xiaoping
on the mainland. The Xinhai Revolution mainly got rid of feudalism (fengjian)
from Late Imperial China. In the usual view of historians, there are two
restorations of feudal power after the revolution: the first was Yuan Shikai;
the second was Zhang Xun. Both were unsuccessful, but the "feudal remnants"
returned to China with the Cultural Revolution in a concept called guanxi,
where people relied not on feudal relationships, but personal relationships,
for survival. While guanxi is helpful in Taiwan, on the mainland, guanxi is
necessary to get anything done. Historical significance. The Xinhai Revolution
overthrew the Qing government and two thousand years of monarchy. Throughout
Chinese history, old dynasties had always been replaced by new dynasties. The
Xinhai Revolution, however, was the first to overthrow a monarchy completely
and attempt to establish a republic to spread democratic ideas throughout
China. Though in 1911 at the provisional government welcome ceremony, Sun Yat-
sen said, "The revolution is not yet successful, the comrades still need to
strive for the future." (é©å‘½å°šæœªæˆåŠŸï¼ŒåŒå¿—ä»éœ€åŠªåŠ›). Since the
1920s, the two dominant partiesâ€“the KMT and CPCâ€“see the Xinhai Revolution
quite differently. Both sides recognize Sun Yat-sen as the Father of the
Nation, but in Taiwan, they mean "Father of the Republic of China". The father
of New China is seen as Mao Zedong. On the mainland, Sun Yat-sen was seen as
the man who helped bring down the Qing, a pre-condition for the Communist state
founded in 1949. The PRC views Sun's work as the first step towards the real
revolution in 1949, when the communists set up a truly independent state that
expelled foreigners and built a military and industrial power. In 1954, Liu
Shaoqi was quoted as saying that the "Xinhai Revolution inserted the concept of
a republic into common people". Zhou Enlai pointed out that the "Xinhai
Revolution overthrew the Qing rule, ended 2000 years of monarchy, and liberated
the mind of people to a great extent, and opened up the path for the
development of future revolution. This is a great victory." Modern evaluation.
A change in the belief that the revolution had been a generally positive change
began in late 1980s and 1990s, but Zhang Shizhao was quoted as arguing that
"When talking about the Xinhai Revolution, the theorist these days tends to
overemphasize. The word 'success' was way overused." The success of the
democracy gained from the revolution can vary depending on one's view. Even
after the death of Sun Yat-sen in 1925, for sixty years, the KMT controlled all
five branches of the government; none were independent. Yan Jiaqi, founder of
the Federation for a Democratic China, has said that Sun Yat-sen is to be
credited as founding China's first republic in 1912, and the second republic is
the people of Taiwan and the political parties there now democratizing the
region. In 2011, president Ma Ying-jeou praised the Western political model for
the successful democratization of Taiwan. Meanwhile, the ideals of democracy
are far from realised on the mainland. For example, the Chinese premier Wen
Jiabao once said in a speech that without real democracy, there is no guarantee
of economic and political rights; but he led a 2011 crackdown against the
peaceful Chinese jasmine protests. Liu Xiaobo, a pro-democracy activist who
received the global 2010 Nobel Peace Prize, is in prison. Others, such as Qin
Yongmin (ç§¦æ°¸æ•) of the Democracy Party of China, who was only released from
prison after twelve years, do not praise the Xinhai Revolution. Qin Yogmin said
the revolution only replaced one dictator with another, that Mao Zedong was not
an emperor, but he is worse than the emperor.
