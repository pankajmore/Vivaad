Jin Dynasty (1115â€“1234) The JÄ«n Dynasty (Jurchen: Anchun Gurun; , ); Manchu:
Aisin Gurun; Khitan language: Nik, Niku; ; 1115â€“1234), also known as the
"Jurchen Dynasty" or "Jurched Dynasty", was founded by the Wanyan (å®Œé¡
WÃ¡nyÃ¡n) clan of the Jurchens, the ancestors of the Manchus who established
the Qing Dynasty some 500 years later. The name is sometimes written as "Jinn"
to differentiate it from an earlier JÃ¬n Dynasty of China whose name is
identically spelled using the Latin alphabet. History. The Jin Dynasty was
founded in what would become northern Manchuria by the Jurchen tribal chieftain
Wanyan Aguda (å®Œé¡é˜¿éª¨æ‰“) in 1115. The Jurchens' early rival was the Liao
Dynasty, which had held sway over northern China, including Manchuria and part
of the Mongol region for several centuries. In 1121, the Jurchens entered into
the Alliance on the Sea with the Song Dynasty and agreed to jointly invade the
Liao. While the Song armies faltered, the Jurchens succeeded in driving the
Liao to Central Asia. In 1125, after the death of Aguda, the Jin broke the
alliance with the Song and invaded North China. On January 9, 1127, Jin forces
ransacked Kaifeng, capital of the Northern Song Dynasty, capturing both Emperor
Qinzong and his father, Emperor Huizong, who had abdicated in panic in the face
of Jin forces. Following the fall of Kaifeng, the succeeding Southern Song
Dynasty continued to fight the Jin for over a decade, eventually signing the
Treaty of Shaoxing in 1141, which called for the cession of all Song land north
of the Huai River to the Jin and the execution of Song General Yue Fei in
return for peace. The migration south. After taking over Northern China, the
Jin Dynasty became increasingly Sinicized. About three million people, half of
them Jurchens, migrated south into northern China over two decades, and this
minority governed about thirty million people. The Jurchens were given land
grants and organized society into 1,000 households - "meng'an") and 100
households - "mouke"). Many married Hans, although the ban on Jurchen nobles
marrying Hans was not lifted until 1191. After Jin Emperor TÃ izÅng died in
1135, the next three Jin emperors were grandsons of WÃ¡nyÃ¡n Ä€gÇ”dÇ by three
different princes. Young Jin Emperor XÄ«zÅng (r. 1135â€“1149) studied the
classics and wrote Chinese poetry. He adopted Han cultural traditions, but the
Jurchen nobles had the top positions. Later in life, Emperor XÄ«zÅng became an
alcoholic and executed many officials for criticizing him. He also had Jurchen
leaders who opposed him murdered, even those in his own Wanyan family clan. In
1149 he was murdered by a cabal of relatives and nobles, who made his cousin
WÃ¡nyÃ¡n LiÃ ng the next Jin emperor. Because of the brutality of both his
domestic and foreign policy, Wanyan Liang was posthumously demoted from the
position of emperor. Consequently, historians have commonly referred to him by
the posthumous name of King HÇilÃ­ng. Rebellions in the north. Having usurped
the throne, Wanyan Liang embarked on the program of legitimizing his rule as an
emperor of China. In 1153, he moved the empire's main capital from Huining Fu
in northern Manchuria (south of present-day Harbin) to the former Liao capital,
Yanjing (now Beijing). Four years later, in 1157, to emphasize the permanence
of the move, he razed the noblesâ€™ residences in Huining. HÇilÃ­ng also
reconstructed the former Song capital, Bianjing (now Kaifeng), which had been
sacked in 1127, making it the Jin's southern capital. Prince HÇilÃ­ng also
tried to suppress dissent by killing Jurchen nobles, executing 155 princes. To
fulfill his dream of becoming the ruler of all China, Prince HÇilÃ­ng attacked
the Southern Song in 1161. Meanwhile, two simultaneous rebellions erupted in
Manchuria: one of Jurchen nobles, led by HÇilÃ­ng's cousin, soon-to-be crowned
WÃ¡nyÃ¡n YÅng (å®Œé¡é›), and the other of Khitan tribesmen. HÇilÃ­ng had to
withdraw Jin troops from southern China to quell the uprisings. The Jin were
defeated in the Battle of Caishi and Battle of Tangdao. With a depleted
military force, Prince HÇilÃ­ng failed to make headway in his attempted
invasion of the Southern Song. Finally he was assassinated by his own generals
in December of 1161, due to his defeats. His son and heir was also assassinated
in the capital. Although crowned in October, WÃ¡nyÃ¡n YÅng was not officially
recognized as Jin Emperor ShÃ¬zÅng (ä¸–å®—) until the murder of Prince
HÇilÃ­ng's heir. The Khitan uprising was not suppressed until 1164; their
horses were confiscated so that the rebels had to take up farming. Other Khitan
and Xi cavalry units had been incorporated into the Jin army. Because these
internal uprisings had severely weakened the Jin's capacity to confront the
Southern Song militarily, the Jin court under Emperor Shizong began negotiating
for peace. The Treaty of LÃ³ngxÄ«ng (éš†èˆˆå’Œè­°) was signed in 1164 and
ushered over 40 years of peace between the two empires. In the early 1180s
Emperor ShÃ¬zÅng instituted a restructuring of 200 "meng'an" units to remove
tax abuses and help Jurchens. Communal farming was encouraged. The Jin empire
prospered and had a large surplus of grain in reserve. Although learned in
Chinese classics, Shizong was also known as a promoter of Jurchen language and
culture; during his reign, a number of Chinese classics were translated into
Jurchen, the Imperial Jurchen Academy was founded, and the Imperial
examinations started to be offered in the Jurchen language. Shizong's reign
(1161â€“1189) was remembered by the posterity as the time of comparative peace
and prosperity, and the emperor himself was compared to the legendary Yao and
Shun ShÃ¬zÅng's grandson, Emperor ZhÄngzÅng (ç« å®—) (r. 1189â€“1208)
venerated Jurchen values, but he also immersed himself in Chinese culture and
married an ethnic Han woman. The "Taihe Code of law" was promulgated in 1201
and was based mostly on the Tang Code. In 1207 the Song tried to invade, but
the Jin forces effectively repulsed them. In the peace agreement the Song had
to pay higher annual indemnities and behead HÃ¡n TÅ«ozhÃ²u (éŸ©ä¾‚èƒ„), the
leader of their war party. Fall of Jin. Starting from the early 13th century
the Jin Dynasty began to feel the pressure of Mongols from the north. Genghis
Khan first led the Mongols into Western Xia territory in 1205 and ravaged them
four years later. In 1211 about 50,000 Mongols on horses invaded the Jin Empire
and began absorbing Khitan and Jurchen rebels. The Jin army had a half million
men with 150,000 cavalry but abandoned the â€œwestern capitalâ€ Datong (see
also Badger's Mount Campaign). The next year the Mongols went north and looted
the Jin "eastern capital", and in 1213 they besieged the "central capital",
Zhongdu (Beijing). In 1214 the Jin made a humiliating treaty but retained the
capital. That summer, Jin Emperor XuÄnzÅng (å®£å®—) abandoned the central
capital and moved the government to the "southern capital" of Kaifeng, making
it the official seat of Jin Dynasty power. In 1216 a war faction persuaded
XuÄnzÅng to attack the Song, but in 1219 they were defeated at the same place
by the Yangtze River, where Prince HÇilÃ­ng had been defeated in 1161. The Jin
now faced a two front war which they could not afford. Furthermore, the Jin
Emperor Ä€izÅng (å“€å®—) won a succession struggle against his brother and
then quickly ended the war and went back to the capital. He made peace with the
Tanguts, who had been allied with the Mongols. Genghis Khan died in 1227 while
his armies were conquering the Western Xia Dynasty. His son Ã–gedei Khan
invaded the Jin Empire in 1232 with assistance from the Southern Song. The
Jurchens tried to resist; but when Kaifeng was attacked, Ä€izÅng fled south.
An allied army of Song and Mongols looted the capital in 1233, and the next
year Ä€izÅng committed suicide to avoid being captured, ending the Jin dynasty
in 1234. The territory of the Jin was to be divided between the Mongols and the
Song. However, due to lingering territorial disputes, the Song and the Mongols
eventually went to war with one another over these territories. In "Empire of
The Steppes", RenÃ© Grousset reports that the Mongols were always amazed at the
valor of the Jin warriors, who held out until seven years after the death of
Genghis Khan. The Jin military. Contemporary Chinese writers ascribed Jurchen
success in overwhelming the Liao and Northern Song mainly to their cavalry.
Already during Aguda's rebellion against the Liao, all Jurchen fighters were
mounted. It was said that the Jurchen cavalry tactics were a carryover from
their hunting skills. Jurchen horsemen were provided with heavy armor; on
occasions, they would use a team of horses attached to each other with chains
(æ‹å­é©¬, "guaizi ma") As the Liao Empire fell apart and the Song retreated
beyond the Yangtze, the army of the new Jin Dynasty absorbed many soldiers who
formerly fought for the Liao or Song. The new Jin empire adopted many of the
Song's weapons, including various machines for siege warfare and artillery. In
fact, the Jin use of cannons, grenades, and even rockets to defend besieged
Kaifeng against the Mongols in 1233 is considered the first ever battle in
human history in which gunpowder was used effectively, even though it failed to
prevent the eventual Jin defeat. On the other hand, Jin Empire was not
particularly good at naval warfare. Both in 1129â€“30 and in 1161 Jin forces
were defeated by the Southern Song navies when trying to cross the Yangtze
River into the core Southern Song territory (see Battle of Tangdao and Battle
of Caishi), even though for the latter campaign the Jin had equipped a large
navy of their own, using Chinese shipbuildiers and even Chinese captains who
had defected from the Southern Song. In 1130 the Jin army reached Hangzhou and
Ningbo in southern China. But heavy Chinese resistance and the geography of the
area halted the Jin advance, and they were forced retreat and withdraw, and
they had not been able to escape the Song navy when trying to return until they
were directed by a Chinese defector who helped them escape in Chenkiang.
Southern China was then cleared of the Jurchen forces. Legacy. Rise of the
Manchus. After thirty years of struggle, the Jurchen chief Nurhaci
(åŠªçˆ¾å“ˆèµ¤) combined the three Jurchen tribes and founded the Later Jin
Dynasty (1616â€“1636). Nurhaci's eighth son and heir, HuÃ¡ng TÃ ijÃ­
(çš‡å¤ªæ¥µ), later changed the name of his people from Jurchen to Manchu in
1635. The next year, he changed the name of the Later Jin to Qing in 1636. List
