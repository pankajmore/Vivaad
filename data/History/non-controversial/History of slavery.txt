History of slavery The history of slavery covers slave systems in historical
perspective in which one human being is legally the property of another, can be
bought or sold, is not allowed to escape and must work for the owner without
any choice involved. As Drescher (2009) argues, "The most crucial and
frequently utilized aspect of the condition is a communally recognized right by
some individuals to possess, buy, sell, discipline, transport, liberate, or
otherwise dispose of the bodies and behavior of other individuals." An integral
element is that children of a slave mother automatically become slaves. It does
not include historical forced labor by prisoners, labor camps, or other forms
of unfree labor in which laborers are not considered property. Slavery can be
traced back to the earliest records, such as the Code of Hammurabi (c.
1760¬ BC), which refers to it as an established institution. Slavery is rare
among hunter-gatherer populations as slavery depends on a system of social
stratification. Slavery typically also requires a shortage of labor and a
surplus of land to be viable. David P. Forsythe wrote: "The fact remained that
at the beginning of the nineteenth century an estimated three-quarters of all
people alive were trapped in bondage against their will either in some form of
slavery or serfdom." Slavery is no longer legal anywhere in the world.
Mauritania abolished it in law in 1981 and was the last country to do so ‚Äì
see Abolition of slavery timeline. However, the number of slaves today is
higher than at any point in history, remaining as high as 12 million to 27
million. Origins. Evidence of slavery predates written records, and has existed
in many cultures. Slavery is rare among hunter‚Äìgatherer populations, as
slavery is a system of social stratification. Mass slavery also requires
economic surpluses and a high population density to be viable. Due to these
factors, the practice of slavery would have only proliferated after the
invention of agriculture during the Neolithic Revolution about 11,000 years
ago. Slavery was known in civilizations as old as Sumer, as well as almost
every other ancient civilization, including Ancient Egypt, Ancient China, the
Akkadian Empire, Assyria, Ancient India, Ancient Greece, the Roman Empire, the
Islamic Caliphate, and the pre-Columbian civilizations of the Americas. Such
institutions were a mixture of debt-slavery, punishment for crime, the
enslavement of prisoners of war, child abandonment, and the birth of slave
children to slaves. Middle East and North Africa. [[File:

tribute to the Barbary states amounted to 20% of United States government
annual revenues in 1800.]] Ancient times. The earliest records of slavery can
be traced to the oldest known records, which treat it as an established
institution, not one newly instituted. The Sumerian Code of Ur-Nammu (c. 2100
BC ‚Äì 2050 BC), the oldest known tablet containing a law code surviving to
today, contains laws regarding to slaves. The Code of Hammurabi (c. 1760 BC),
for example, stated that death was prescribed for anyone who helped a slave to
escape, as well as for anyone who sheltered a fugitive. The Bible refers to
slavery as an established institution. Hittite texts from Anatolia include laws
regulating the institution of slavery. In Egypt, private ownership of slaves,
captured in war and given by the king to their captor, certainly occurred at
the beginning of the Eighteenth Dynasty (1550 ‚Äì 1295 BC). Sales of slaves
occurred in the Twenty-fifth Dynasty (732 ‚Äì 656 BC), and contracts of
servitude survive from the Twenty-sixth Dynasty (c. 672 ‚Äì 525 BC) and from
the reign of Darius: apparently such a contract then required the consent of
the slave. Medieval period. Slavery was common in Medieval Europe in both
Christian and Muslim lands. The Arab slave trade lasted more than a millennium.
Slaves in the Arab World came from many different regions, including Sub-
Saharan Africa (mainly "Zanj"), the Caucasus (mainly Circassians), Central Asia
(mainly Tartars), and Central and Eastern Europe (mainly "Saqaliba"). The
medieval scholar and traveler Ibn Battuta states several times that he was
given or purchased slaves. The Arab slave trade is thought to have originated
with trans-Saharan slavery. Arab, Indian, Somali and Asian traders were
involved in the capture and transport of slaves northward across the Sahara
desert and the Indian Ocean region into Arabia and the Middle East, Persia,
Somalia, Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent. The slave trade from East
Africa to Arabia was dominated by Arab and Somali traders in the coastal cities
of Zanzibar, Dar Es Salaam and Mombasa. Tens of thousands of black Zanj slaves
were imported to lower Iraq, where they may have, according to Richard Hellie,
constituted at least a half of the total population there in the 9th and 10th
centuries. At the same time, many tens of thousands of slaves in the region
were also imported from Central Asia and the Caucasus. Male slaves were
employed as servants, soldiers, or laborers, while female slaves were traded to
Middle Eastern countries and kingdoms by Arab, Indian, Somali or Asian traders,
some as domestic servants and others in harems. Some historians estimate that
between 11 and 17 million slaves crossed the Red Sea, Indian Ocean, and Sahara
Desert from 650 to 1900¬ AD. The Moors, starting in the 8th century, raided
coastal areas around the Mediterranean and Atlantic Ocean, and became known as
the Barbary pirates. It is estimated that they captured 1.25 million slaves
from Western Europe and North America between the 16th and 19th centuries. In
1400 Tamerlane invaded the Kingdom of Georgia and its fief Armenia. More than
60,000 people from the Caucasus were captured as slaves, and many districts of
Armenia were depopulated. From 1569 the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth suffered
a series of Tatar invasions, the goal of which was to loot, pillage and capture
slaves into "jasyr". The borderland area to the south-east was in a state of
semi-permanent warfare until the 18th century. Some researchers estimate that
altogether more than 3 million people, predominantly Ukrainians but also
Circassians, Russians, Belarusians, Poles and Jews were captured and enslaved
during the time of the Crimean Khanate. Russian conquest of the Crimea led to
the abolition of slavery by the 1780s. Slavery was an important part of Ottoman
society. In Constantinople (today Istanbul), about 1/5 of the population
consisted of slaves. As late as 1908 women slaves were still sold in the
Ottoman Empire. In the middle of the 14th century, Murad I built his own
personal slave army called the "Kapƒ±kulu". The new force was based on the
sultan's right to a fifth of the war booty, which he interpreted to include
captives taken in battle. The captive slaves were converted to Islam and
trained in the sultan's personal service. In the "dev≈üirme" (Turkish for
'gathering'), young Christian boys from the Balkans were taken away from their
homes and families, converted to Islam and enlisted into special soldier
classes of the Ottoman army or the civil service. These soldier classes were
named Janissaries, the most famous branch of the "Kapƒ±kulu". The Janissaries
eventually became a decisive factor in the Ottoman invasions of Europe. Most of
the military commanders of the Ottoman forces, imperial administrators and "de
facto" rulers of the Ottoman Empire, such as Pargalƒ± ƒ∞brahim Pasha and
Sokollu Mehmet Pa≈üa, were recruited in this way. By 1609 the Sultan's
"Kapƒ±kulu" forces increased to about 100,000. By this time however, the
expeditions for young Christian boys were rare. The increased numbers of
janissaries came from Muslim peasants who were now allowed into service as a
result of increased military demands of 17th-century warfare. The Mamluks were
slave soldiers who converted to Islam and served the Muslim caliphs and the
Ayyubid sultans during the Middle Ages. The first mamluks served the Abbasid
caliphs in 9th-century Baghdad. Over time they became a powerful military
caste, and on more than one occasion they seized power for themselves, for
example, ruling Egypt in the years 1250‚Äì1517. From 1250 Egypt had been ruled
by the Bahri dynasty of Kipchak Turk origin. White slaves from the Caucasus
served in the army and formed an elite corps of troops eventually revolting in
Egypt to form the Burgi dynasty. Mamluks were mainly responsible for the
expulsion of the Crusaders from Palestine and preventing the Mongol Ilkhanate
of Persia and Iraq from entering Egypt. The Moroccan Sultan Moulay Ismail "the
Bloodthirsty" (1672‚Äì1727) raised a corps of 150,000 black slaves, called his
Black Guard, who coerced the country into submission. Nautical traders from the
United States became targets, and frequent victims, of the Barbary pirates, as
soon as that nation began trading with Europe and refused to pay the required
tribute to the North African states. Barbary pirates. According to Robert Davis
between 1 million and 1.25 million Europeans were captured by Barbary pirates
and sold as slaves in North Africa and Ottoman Empire between the 16th and 19th
centuries. The coastal villages and towns of Italy, Portugal, Spain and
Mediterranean islands were frequently attacked by them and long stretches of
the Italian, Portuguese and Spanish coasts were almost completely abandoned by
their inhabitants; after 1600 Barbary pirates occasionally entered the Atlantic
and struck as far north as Iceland. In 1544, Hayreddin Barbarossa captured
Ischia, taking 4,000 prisoners in the process, and deported to slavery some
9,000 inhabitants of Lipari, almost the entire population. In 1551, Turgut Reis
(known as Dragut in the West) enslaved the entire population of the Maltese
island Gozo, between 5,000 and 6,000, sending them to Libya. When pirates
sacked Vieste in southern Italy in 1554 they took 7,000 slaves. In 1555, Turgut
Reis sailed to Corsica and ransacked Bastia, taking 6,000 prisoners. In 1558
Barbary corsairs captured the town of Ciutadella (Minorca), destroyed it,
slaughtered the inhabitants and carried off 3,000 survivors to Istanbul as
slaves. In 1563 Turgut Reis landed at the shores of the province of Granada,
Spain, and captured the coastal settlements in the area like Almu√±√©car, along
with 4,000 prisoners. Barbary pirates frequently attacked the Balearic islands,
resulting in many coastal watchtowers and fortified churches being erected. The
threat was so severe that the island of Formentera became uninhabited. In
Portugal for instance, the coastal city of Nazar√© was raided several times
during until the 16th century when the local fortress was built (according to
Pedro Penteado and his book based in the historical ecclesiastic diaries of
Nazar√©). The city of Lisbon built the Torre de Bel√©m to defend the capital
against these pirates. Between 1609 and 1616 England alone had a staggering 466
merchant ships lost to Barbary pirates. 160 English ships were captured by
Algerians between 1677 and 1680. Slave-taking persisted into the 19th century
when Barbary pirates would capture ships and enslave the crew. Even the United
States was not immune. In 1783 the United States made peace with, and gained
recognition from, the British monarchy, and in 1784 the first American ship was
seized by pirates from Morocco. Payments in ransom and tribute to the Barbary
states amounted to 20% of United States government annual revenues in 1800. It
was not until 1815 that naval victories in the Barbary Wars ended tribute
payments by the U.S., although some European nations continued annual payments
until the 1830s. Among the most important slave markets where Pirates operated
in Mediterranean Europe were the ports of Majorca, Toulon, Marseille, Genoa,
Pisa, Livorno and Malta. In Africa, the most important were the ports of
Morocco, Tripoli, Algiers and Tunis. Asia. Indian subcontinent. Slavery in
India is evidenced since ancient times. Manu the Lawgiver, in his "Manu Smriti"
lists seven different kinds of slaves. The nature of slavery in India was
extremely complex and cut across boundaries of caste, gender, kin, religion,
and role. The early Arab invaders of Sind in the 8th century, the armies of the
Umayyad commander Muhammad bin Qasim, are reported to have enslaved tens of
thousands of Indian prisoners, including both soldiers and civilians. In the
early 11th century Tarikh al-Yamini, the Arab historian Al-Utbi recorded that
in 1001 the armies of Mahmud of Ghazna conquered Peshawar and Waihand (capital
of Gandhara) after Battle of Peshawar (1001), "in the midst of the land of
Hindustan", and captured some 100,000 youths. Later, following his twelfth
expedition into India in 1018‚Äì19, Mahmud is reported to have returned with
such a large number of slaves that their value was reduced to only two to ten
dirhams each. This unusually low price made, according to Al-Utbi, "merchants
from distant cities to purchase them, so that the countries of Central Asia,
Iraq and Khurasan were swelled with them, and the fair and the dark, the rich
and the poor, mingled in one common slavery". Elliot and Dowson refers to "five
hundred thousand slaves, beautiful men and women.". Later, during the Delhi
Sultanate period (1206‚Äì1555), references to the abundant availability of low-
priced Indian slaves abound. Levi attributes this primarily to the vast human
resources of India, compared to its neighbours to the north and west (Mughal
Indian population being approximately 12 to 20 times that of Turan and Iran at
the end of the 16th century) . Arab slave traders also brought slaves as early
as the 1st century AD from Africa. Most of the African slaves were brought,
however, in the 17th century and were taken into Western India. The Siddi
people are of mainly East African descent. Much of the northern and central
parts of the subcontinent was ruled by the so-called Slave Dynasty of Turkic
origin from 1206 to 1290: Qutb-ud-din Aybak, a slave of Muhammad Ghori rose to
power following his master's death. For almost a century, his descendants ruled
presiding over the introduction of Tankas and building of Qutub Minar.
According to Sir Henry Bartle Frere (who sat on the Viceroy's Council), there
were an estimated 8,000,000 or 9,000,000 slaves in India in 1841. In Malabar,
about 15% of the population were slaves. Slavery was officially abolished in
India by the Indian Slavery Act V. of 1843. Provisions of the Indian Penal Code
of 1861 effectively abolished slavery in India by making the enslavement of
human beings a criminal offense. Modern times. There are several million bonded
laborers in India, who work as slaves to pay off debts; a majority of them are
Dalits. There are also an estimated five million bonded workers in Pakistan,
even though the government has passed laws and set up funds to eradicate the
practice and rehabilitate the labourers. As many as 200,000 Nepali girls, many
under 14, have been sold into sex slavery in India. Nepalese women and girls,
especially virgins, are favored in India because of their fair skin and young
looks. In 1997, a human rights agency reported that 40,000 Nepalese workers are
subject to slavery and 200,000 kept in bonded labour. Nepal's Maoist-led
government has abolished the slavery-like Haliya system in 2008. Afghanistan.
In response to the Hazara uprising of 1892, the Afghan Emir Abdur Rahman Khan
declared a "Jihad" against the Shiites. His large army defeated the rebellion
at its center, in Oruzgan, by 1892 and the local population was being
massacred. According to S. A. Mousavi, ""thousands of Hazara men, women, and
children were sold as slaves in the markets of Kabul and Qandahar, while
numerous towers of human heads were made from the defeated rebels as a warning
to others who might challenge the rule of the Amir"". Until the 20th century,
some Hazaras were still kept as slaves by the Pashtuns; although Amanullah Khan
banned slavery in Afghanistan during his reign, the practice carried on
unofficially for many more years. China. Slavery throughout pre-modern Chinese
history has repeatedly come in and out of favor. Due to the enormous population
and relatively high development of the region throughout most of its history,
China has always had a large workforce. Historically, Chinese families
customarily had an average of four children or more. This custom was well
suited to the agrarian societies of the period. In times of hardship such as
widespread famine or severe financial difficulty, parents of poor families sold
some of their children to wealthy homes, to be treated as future brides,
servants or slaves. This depended on the compassion and good grace of the
master. However, more often it was teenagers or young adults who turned
themselves in to become servants. They were not technically slaves since they
received periodic payments, which they usually sent home to their families.
Tang Dynasty. During the Tang dynasty, Chinese captured Korean civilians from
Koguryo, Paekche, and Silla to sell as slaves. Qing Dynasty. In the 17th
century Qing Dynasty, there was a hereditarily servile people called "Booi Aha"
(Manchu:booi niyalma; Chinese transliteration: ÂåÖË°£ÈòøÂìà), which is a Manchu
word literally translated as "household person" and sometimes rendered as
"nucai" or "slaves". In his book "China Marches West", Peter C. Perdue stated:
"In 1624(After Nurhachi's invasion of Liaodong) "Chinese households...while
those with less were made into slaves." The Manchu was establishing close
personal and paternalist relationship between masters and their slaves, as
Nurhachi said:" The Master should love the slaves and eat the same food as
him". Perdue further pointed out that booi aha "did not correspond exactly to
the Chinese category of "bondservant-slave" (Chinese:Â•¥ÂÉï); instead, it was a
relationship of personal dependency on a master which in theory guaranteed
close personal relationships and equal treatment, even though many western
scholars would directly translate "booi" as "bondservant". Chinese muslim
(Tungans) Sufis who were charged with practicing xiejiao (heterodox religion),
were punished by exile to Xinjiang and being sold as a slave to other muslims,
such as the Sufi begs. Han chinese who committed crimes such as those dealing
with opium became slaves to the begs, this practice was administered by Qing
law. Most Chinese in Altishahr were exile slaves to Turkestani Begs.
Ironically, while free Chinese merchants generally did not engage in
relationships with East Turkestani women, some of the Chinese slaves belonging
to begs, along with Green Standard soldiers, Bannermen, and Manchus, engaged in
affairs with the East Turkestani women that were serious in nature. The Qing
dynasty procured 420 women and girl slaves, all of them Mongol, to service
Oirat Mongol bannermen stationed in Xinjiang in 1764. Many Torghut Mongol boys
and girls were sold to Central Asian markets or on the local Xinjiang market to
native Turkestanis. Gray, John Henry. (1878). "China: A History of the Laws,
Manners and Customs of the People", pp. 241‚Äì243. Reprint: Dover Publications,
Mineola, New York. (2002). William Mesny. (13 May 1905). "Mesny's Miscellany",
Vol IV, p. 399. Modern times. All forms of slavery have been illegal in China
since 1910, although the practice still exists through illegal trafficking in
some areas. Japan. Slavery in Japan was, for most of its history, indigenous,
since the export and import of slaves was restricted by Japan being a group of
islands. However, Koreans were shipped to Japan as slaves during the Japanese
invasions of Korea in the 16th century. The export of a slave from Japan is
recorded in a 3rd-century Chinese document, although the system involved is
unclear. These people were called , lit. "living mouth". "Seiko" from
historical theories are thought to be as prisoner, slave, a person who has
technical skill and also students studying abroad to China. In the 8th century,
a slave was called and a series of laws on slavery was issued. In an area of
present-day Ibaraki Prefecture, out of a population of 190,000, around 2,000
were slaves; the proportion is believed to have been even higher in western
Japan. Slavery persisted into the Sengoku period (1467‚Äì1615), but the
attitude that slavery was anachronistic had become widespread. Oda Nobunaga is
said to have had an African slave or former-slave in his retinue. In late-16th-
century Japan, slavery was officially banned; but forms of contract and
indentured labor persisted alongside the period penal codes' forced labor.
Somewhat later, the Edo period penal laws prescribed "non-free labor" for the
immediate family of executed criminals in Article 17 of the "Got≈çke reij≈ç"
(Tokugawa House Laws), but the practice never became common. The 1711 "Got≈çke
reij≈ç" was compiled from over 600 statutes promulgated between 1597 and 1696.
World War II. As the Empire of Japan annexed Asian countries, from the late
19th century onwards, archaic institutions including slavery were abolished in
those countries. However, during the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Pacific
War, the Japanese military used millions of civilians and prisoners of war as
forced labor, on projects such as the Burma Railway. According to a joint study
by historians including Zhifen Ju, Mitsuyoshi Himeta, Toru Kubo and Mark
Peattie, more than 10 million Chinese civilians were mobilized by the "K≈ça-in"
(Japanese Asia Development Board) for forced labour. According to the Japanese
military's own record, nearly 25% of 140,000 Allied POWs died while interned in
Japanese prison camps where they were forced to work (U.S. POWs died at a rate
of 37%). More than 100,000 civilians and POWs died in the construction of the
Burma-Siam Railway. The U.S. Library of Congress estimates that in Java,
between 4 and 10 million "romusha" (Japanese: "manual laborer"), were forced to
work by the Japanese military. About 270,000 of these Javanese laborers were
sent to other Japanese-held areas in South East Asia. Only 52,000 were
repatriated to Java, meaning that there was a death rate of 80%. (For further
details, see Japanese war crimes.) Approximately 5,400,000 Koreans were
conscripted from 1939 to 1945. About 670,000 of them were taken to Japan, where
about 60,000 died between 1939 and 1945 due mostly to exhaustion or poor
working conditions. Many of those taken to Karafuto Prefecture (modern-day
Sakhalin) were trapped there at the end of the war, stripped of their
nationality and denied repatriation by Japan; they became known as the Sakhalin
Koreans. The total deaths of Korean forced laborers in Korea and Manchuria for
those years is estimated to be between 270,000 and 810,000. As many as 200,000
women, mostly from Korea and China, and some other countries such as the
Philippines, Taiwan, Burma, the Dutch East Indies, Netherlands, and Australia
were forced into sexual slavery during World War II. (See Comfort women) Korea.
Indigenous slaves existed in Korea. Slavery was officially abolished with the
Gabo Reform of 1894 but remained extant in reality until 1930. During the
Joseon Dynasty (1392‚Äì1910), Korea was a hierarchical society, and slaves
accounted for 30 to 40 percent of society as well as half of the population in
the capital. The lowest classes in Korea were the Cheonmin, which included
slaves called Nobi. Low status was hereditary, but members of higher classes
could be reduced to Cheonmin as a form of legal punishment. During poor
harvests and famine, many peasants would voluntarily sell themselves into
slavery in order to survive. Cheonmin were looked down upon in Korean society;
however, they could have private property, while slaves could not own private
property. Unless freed by their masters, slaves were never able to move into a
higher class. Southeast Asia. There was a large slave class in Khmer Empire who
built the enduring monuments in Angkor Wat and did most of the heavy work.
Slaves had been taken captive from the mountain tribes. People unable to pay
back a debt to the upper ruling class could be sentenced to work as a slave
too. Between the 17th and the early 20th centuries one-quarter to one-third of
the population of some areas of Thailand and Burma were slaves. In Siam
(Thailand), the war captives became the property of the king. During the reign
of Rama III (1824‚Äì1851), there were an estimated 46,000 war slaves. Slaves
from independent hill populations were ""hunted incessantly and carried off as
slaves by the Siamese, the Anamites, and the Cambodians"" (Colquhoun 1885:53).
Slavery was not abolished in Siam until 1905. Yi people in Yunnan practiced a
complicated form of slavery. People were split into the Black Yi (nobles, 7% of
the population), White Yi (commoners), Ajia (33% of the Yi population) and the
Xiaxi (10%). Ajia and Xiaxi were slave castes. The White Yi were not slaves but
had no freedom of movement. The Black Yi were famous for their slave-raids on
Han Chinese communities. After 1959 some 700,000 slaves were freed. Slaves in
Toraja society in Indonesia were family property. Sometimes Torajans decided to
become slaves when they incurred a debt, pledging to work as payment. Slaves
could be taken during wars, and slave trading was common. Torajan slaves were
sold and shipped out to Java and Siam. Slaves could buy their freedom, but
their children still inherited slave status. Slaves were prohibited from
wearing bronze or gold, carving their houses, eating from the same dishes as
their owners, or having sex with free women‚Äîa crime punishable by death.
Slavery was abolished in 1863 in all Dutch colonies. Slavery in pre-Spanish
Philippines was practiced by the tribal Austronesian peoples who inhabited the
culturally diverse islands. Modern times. There are currently an estimated
300,000 women and children involved in the sex trade throughout Southeast Asia.
It is common that Thai women are lured to Japan and sold to Yakuza-controlled
brothels where they are forced to work off their price. According to the
International Labor Organization (ILO), an estimated 800,000 people are subject
to forced labor in Myanmar. In November 2006, the International Labor
Organization announced it will be seeking "to prosecute members of the ruling
Myanmar junta for crimes against humanity" over the continuous forced labor of
its citizens by the military at the International Court of Justice. According
to Kevin Bales, a professor of human rights and consultant to the United
Nations, there are about 27 million slaves in the world, as of the year 2010.
Professor Bales is co-founder of Free the Slaves, a non-governmental
organization. Crimean Khanate. In the time of the Crimean Khanate, Crimeans
engaged in frequent raids into the Danubian principalities, Poland-Lithuania,
and Muscovy. For each captive, the khan received a fixed share (savƒüa) of 10%
or 20%. The campaigns by Crimean forces categorize into "sefers", officially
declared military operations led by the khans themselves, and "√ßapuls", raids
undertaken by groups of noblemen, sometimes illegally because they contravened
treaties concluded by the khans with neighbouring rulers). For a long time,
until the early 18th century, the khanate maintained a massive Slave Trade with
the Ottoman Empire and the Middle East. Caffa was one of the best known and
significant trading ports and slave markets. Crimean Tatar raiders enslaved
more than 1 million Eastern Europeans. Central Asia and the Caucasus. Russian
conquest of the Caucasus led to the abolition of slavery by the 1860s and the
conquest of the Central Asian Islamic khanates of Bukhara, Samarkand, and Khiva
by the 1870s. The Russian administration liberated the slaves of the Kazakhs in
1859. A notorious slave market for captured Russian and Persian slaves was
centred in the Khanate of Khiva from the 17th to the 19th century. During the
first half of the 19th century alone, some one million Persians, as well as an
unknown number of Russians, were enslaved and transported to Central Asian
khanates. When the Russian troops took Khiva in 1898 there were 29,300 Persian
slaves, captured by Turkoman raiders. According of Josef Wolff (Report of
1843‚Äì1845) the population of the Khanate of Bukhara was 1,200,000, of whom
200,000 were Persian slaves. At the beginning of the 21st century Chechens and
Ingush kept Russian captives as slaves or in slave-like conditions in the
mountains of the northern Caucasus. Europe. Ancient Greece. Records of slavery
in Ancient Greece go as far back as Mycenaean Greece. The origins are not
known, but it appears that slavery became an important part of the economy and
society only after the establishment of cities. Slavery was common practice and
an integral component of ancient Greece throughout its rich history, as it was
in other societies of the time including ancient Israel and early Christian
societies. It is estimated that in Athens, the majority of citizens owned at
least one slave. Most ancient writers considered slavery not only natural but
necessary, but some isolated debate began to appear, notably in Socratic
dialogues while the Stoics produced the first condemnation of slavery recorded
in history. During the 8th and the 7th centuries BC, in the course of the two
Messenian Wars the Spartans reduced an entire population to a pseudo-slavery
called "helotry". According to Herodotus (IX, 28‚Äì29), helots were seven times
as numerous as Spartans. Following several helot revolts around the year 600
BC, the Spartans restructured their city-state along authoritarian lines, for
the leaders decided that only by turning their society into an armed camp could
they hope to maintain control over the numerically dominant helot population.
In some Ancient Greek city states about 30% of the population consisted of
slaves, but paid and slave labor seem to have been equally important. Rome.
Romans inherited the institution of slavery from the Greeks and the
Phoenicians. As the Roman Republic expanded outward, entire populations were
enslaved, thus creating an ample supply to work in Rome's farms and households.
The people subjected to Roman slavery came from all over Europe and the
Mediterranean. Such oppression by an elite minority eventually led to slave
revolts; the Third Servile War led by Spartacus was the most famous and severe.
Greeks, Berbers, Germans, Britons, Slavs, Thracians, Gauls (or Celts), Jews,
Arabs, and many more were slaves used not only for labor, but also for
amusement (e.g. gladiators and sex slaves). If a slave ran away, he was liable
to be crucified. By the late Republican era, slavery had become a vital
economic pillar in the wealth of Rome. In the Roman Empire, probably over 25%
of the empire's population, and 30 to 40% of the population of Italy was
enslaved. Celtic Tribes. Celtic tribes of Europe are recorded by various Roman
sources as owning slaves. The extent of slavery in prehistorical Europe is not
well known however. The Vikings and Scandinavia. In the Viking era beginning
circa 793, the Norse raiders often captured and enslaved militarily weaker
peoples they encountered. In the Nordic countries the slaves were called
"thralls" (Old Norse: "√ûr√¶ll"). The thralls were mostly from Western Europe,
among them many Franks, Anglo-Saxons, and Celts. Many Irish slaves participated
in the colonization of Iceland. There is evidence of German, Baltic, Slavic and
Latin slaves as well. The slave trade was one of the pillars of Norse commerce
during the 6th through 11th centuries. The Persian traveller Ibn Rustah
described how Swedish Vikings, the Varangians or Rus, terrorized and enslaved
the Slavs. The thrall system was finally abolished in the mid-14th century in
Scandinavia. Middle Ages. Chaos and invasion made the taking of slaves habitual
throughout Europe in the early Middle Ages. St. Patrick, himself captured and
sold as a slave, protested against an attack that enslaved newly baptized
Christians in his . Slavery during the Early Middle Ages had several distinct
sources. The Vikings raided across Europe, though their slave raids were the
most destructive in the British Isles and Eastern Europe. While the Vikings
kept some slaves for themselves as servants, known as thralls, most people
captured by the Vikings would be sold on the Byzantine or Islamic markets. In
the West the targets of Viking slavery were primarily English, Irish, and
Scottish, while in the East they were mainly Slavs. The Viking slave trade
slowly ended in the 11th century, as the Vikings settled in the European
territories they once raided, Christianized serfdom, and merged with the local
populace. The Normans made slaves of the English gentry after invasion in 1066
and deported them to Spain. They continued taking Welsh Slaves during the
Medieval period who were traded in London. The Islamic World was also a main
factor in Medieval European slavery. Although slavery had different
implications for slaves: (i) If they converted to Islam their master had the
obligation to free them and if they did not they have to teach them. (ii)
Slaves could rise socially by marriage and attain high office. (iii) The
principal requirement was for military service. The conquest by Tariq took
place in 711¬ AD to liberate the population from Visigoth persecution Tariq ibn
Ziyad (in his speech to his troops though, Ibn Ziyad spoke more of women they
would capture more than liberating the people of Iberia). Raiding often
involved taking slaves and involved Viking assistance. In the 16th and 17th
centuries during the Protestant Catholic Wars, the North Africans intensified
the white slave trade with European collaboration, although slavery was
practised in Christian states as well until the end of serfdom (a practice that
could be more brutal than slavery). The Muslim powers of Iberia both raided for
slaves and purchased slaves from European merchants, often the Jewish
Radhanites, one of the few groups that could easily move between the Christian
and Islamic worlds. As the Muslims failed to conquer Europe in the 8th century,
they made an alliance with the Vikings who raided the shores of Spain, southern
Portugal and France, and Italy, that would last roughly from the 9th century
until the 12th century, when the Italian city-states of Genoa, Venice, and
Pisa, along with the Spanish kingdoms of Aragon and Castile, as well as the
Sicilian Normans, began to dominate the Mediterranean trade. The Middle Ages
from 1100 to 1500 saw a continuation of the European slave trade, though with a
shift from the Western Mediterranean Islamic nations to the Eastern, as Venice
and Genoa, in firm control of the Eastern Mediterranean from the 12th century
and the Black Sea from the 13th century sold both Slavic and Baltic slaves, as
well as Georgians, Turks, and other ethnic groups of the Black Sea and
Caucasus, to the Muslim nations of the Middle East. The sale of European slaves
by Europeans slowly ended as the Slavic and Baltic ethnic groups Christianized
by the Late Middle Ages. European slaves in the Islamic World would, however,
continue into the Modern time period as Muslim pirates, primarily Algerians,
with the support of the Ottoman Empire, raided European coasts and shipping
from the 16th to the 19th centuries, ending their attacks with the naval
decline of the Ottoman Empire in the late 16th and 17th centuries, as well as
the European conquest of North Africa throughout the 19th century. The Mongol
invasions and conquests in the 13th century made the situation worse. The
Mongols enslaved skilled individuals, women and children and marched them to
Karakorum or Sarai, whence they were sold throughout Eurasia. Many of these
slaves were shipped to the slave market in Novgorod. Slave commerce during the
Late Middle Ages was mainly in the hands of Venetian and Genoese merchants and
cartels, who were involved in the slave trade with the Golden Horde. In 1382
the Golden Horde under Khan Tokhtamysh sacked Moscow, burning the city and
carrying off thousands of inhabitants as slaves. Between 1414 and 1423, some
10,000 eastern European slaves were sold in Venice. Genoese merchants organized
the slave trade from the Crimea to Mamluk Egypt. For years the Khanates of
Kazan and Astrakhan routinely made raids on Russian principalities for slaves
and to plunder towns. Russian chronicles record about 40 raids of Kazan Khans
on the Russian territories in the first half of the 16th century. In 1521, the
combined forces of Crimean Khan Mehmed Giray and his Kazan allies attacked
Moscow and captured thousands of slaves. In 1441, Haci I Giray declared
independence from the Golden Horde and established the Crimean Khanate. For a
long time, until the early 18th century, the khanate maintained a massive slave
trade with the Ottoman Empire and the Middle East. In a process called the
"harvesting of the steppe", they enslaved many Slavic peasants. About 30 major
Tatar raids were recorded into Muscovite territories between 1558 and 1596. In
1571, the Crimean Tatars attacked and sacked Moscow, burning everything but the
Kremlin and taking thousands of captives as slaves. In Crimea, about 75% of the
population consisted of slaves. Medieval Spain and Portugal were the scene of
almost constant warfare between Muslims and Christians. Periodic raiding
expeditions were sent from Al-Andalus to ravage the Iberian Christian kingdoms,
bringing back booty and slaves. In a raid against Lisbon, Portugal in 1189, for
example, the Almohad caliph Yaqub al-Mansur took 3,000 female and child
captives, while his governor of C√≥rdoba, in a subsequent attack upon Silves,
Portugal in 1191, took 3,000 Christian slaves. The Byzantine-Ottoman wars and
the Ottoman wars in Europe brought large numbers of Christian slaves into the
Islamic world too. After the battle of Lepanto approximately 12,000 Christian
galley slaves were freed from the Ottoman fleet. Christians were also selling
Muslim slaves captured in war. The Knights of Malta attacked pirates and Muslim
shipping, and their base became a centre for slave trading, selling captured
North Africans and Turks. Malta remained a slave market until well into the
late 18th century. It required a thousand slaves to equip merely the galleys
(ships) of the Order. Slavery in Poland was forbidden in the 15th century; in
Lithuania, slavery was formally abolished in 1588; they were replaced by the
second enserfment. Slavery remained a minor institution in Russia until the
1723, when the Peter the Great converted the household slaves into house serfs.
Russian agricultural slaves were formally converted into serfs earlier in 1679.
The runaway Polish and Russian serfs and kholops known as Cossacks ('outlaws')
formed autonomous communities in the southern steppes. Portugal. The 15th-
century Portuguese exploration of the African coast is commonly regarded as the
harbinger of European colonialism. In 1452, Pope Nicholas V issued the papal
bull Dum Diversas, granting Afonso V of Portugal the right to reduce any
"Saracens, pagans and any other unbelievers" to hereditary slavery which
legitimized slave trade under Catholic beliefs of that time. This approval of
slavery was reaffirmed and extended in his Romanus Pontifex bull of 1455. These
papal bulls came to serve as a justification for the subsequent era of slave
trade and European colonialism. Although for a short period as in 1462, Pius II
declared slavery to be "a great crime". The followers of the church of England
and Protestants did not use the papal bull as a justification. The position of
the church was to condemn the slavery of Christians, but slavery was regarded
as an old established and necessary institution which supplied Europe with the
necessary workforce. In the 16th century African slaves had substituted almost
all other ethnicities and religious enslaved groups in Europe. Within the
Portuguese territory of Brazil, and even beyond its original borders, the
enslavement of native Americans was carried out by the Bandeirantes. Among many
other European slave markets, Genoa, and Venice were some well-known markets,
their importance and demand growing after the great plague of the 14th century
which decimated much of the European work force. The maritime town of Lagos,
Portugal, was the first slave market created in Portugal for the sale of
imported African slaves ‚Äì the "Mercado de Escravos", opened in 1444. In 1441,
the first slaves were brought to Portugal from northern Mauritania. Prince
Henry the Navigator, major sponsor of the Portuguese African expeditions, as of
any other merchandise, taxed one fifth of the selling price of the slaves
imported to Portugal. By the year 1552 African slaves made up 10 percent of the
population of Lisbon. In the second half of the 16th century, the Crown gave up
the monopoly on slave trade and the focus of European trade in African slaves
shifted from import to Europe to slave transports directly to tropical colonies
in the Americas ‚Äì in the case of Portugal, especially Brazil. In the 15th
century one third of the slaves were resold to the African market in exchange
of gold. As Portugal increased its presence along China's coast, they began
trading in slaves. Many Chinese slaves were sold to Portugal. Since the 16th
century Chinese slaves existed in Portugal, most of them were Chinese children
and a large amount were shipped to the Indies. Chinese prisoners were sent to
Portugal, where they were sold as slaves, they were prized and regarded better
than moorish and black slaves. The first known visit of a Chinese person to
Europe dates to 1540, when a Chinese scholar, enslaved during one of several
Portuguese raids somewhere on the southern China coast, was brought to
Portugal. Purchased by Jo√£o de Barros, he worked with the Portuguese historian
on translating Chinese texts into Portuguese. Dona Maria de Vilhena, a
Portuguese noble woman from √âvora, Portugal, owned a Chinese male slave in
1562. In the 16th century, a small number of Chinese slaves, around 29‚Äì34
people were in southern Portugal, where they were used in agricultural labor.
Chinese boys were captured in China, and through Macau were brought to Portugal
and sold as slaves in Lisbon. Some were then sold in Brazil, a Portuguese
colony. Due to hostilty from the Chinese regarding the trafficking in Chinese
slaves, in 1595 a law was passed by Portugal banning the selling and buying of
Chinese slaves. On 19 February 1624, the King of Portugal forbade the
enslavement of Chinese of either sex. Spain. Spain had to fight against
relatively powerful civilizations of the New World. However, the Spanish
conquest of the indigenous peoples in the Americas was also facilitated by the
spread of diseases (e.g. smallpox) due to lack of biological immunity. (like
the Europeans that had lack of biological immunity to African diseases) The
Spaniards were the first Europeans to use African slaves in the New World on
islands such as Cuba and Hispaniola, where the native population starved
themselves rather than work for the Spanish. Although the natives were used as
forced labor (the Spanish employed the pre-Columbian draft system called the
mita), the spread of disease caused a shortage of labor, and so the Spanish
colonists gradually became involved in the Atlantic slave trade. The first
African slaves arrived in Hispaniola in 1501; by 1517, the natives had been
"virtually annihilated" by the settlers. Netherlands. Although slavery was
illegal inside the Netherlands it flourished in the Dutch Empire, and helped
support the economy. By 1650 the Dutch had the pre-eminent slave trade in
Europe. They were overtaken by Britain around 1700. Historians agree that in
all the Dutch shipped about 550,000 African slaves across the Atlantic, about
75,000 of whom died on board before reaching their destinations. From 1596 to
1829, the Dutch traders sold 250,000 slaves in the Dutch Guianas, 142,000 in
the Dutch Caribbean islands, and 28,000 in Dutch Brazil. In addition, tens of
thousands of slaves, mostly from India and some from Africa, were carried to
the Dutch East Indies. Great Britain and Ireland. Slavery was practised by the
Romans, but when they left in the 5th century they took their slaves with them.
Anglo-Saxon Germanic settlers brought in slaves. Capture in war, voluntary
servitude and debt slavery became common, and slaves were routinely bought and
sold, but running away was common and slavery was never a major economic
factor. Ireland and Denmark were markets for captured Anglo Saxon and Celtic
slaves. Pope Gregory I reputedly made the pun, "Non Angli, sed Angeli" ("Not
Angles, but Angels"), after a response to his query regarding the identity of a
group of fair-haired Angles slave children whom he had observed in the
marketplace. After 1100 slavery faded away as uneconomical. Barbary Corsairs.
From the 16th to 19th century, Barbary Corsairs raided the coasts of Europe and
attacked lone ships at sea. From 1609 to 1616, England lost 466 merchant ships
to Barbary pirates. 160 English ships were captured by Algerians between 1677
and 1680. Many of the captured sailors were made into slaves and held for
ransom. The corsairs were no strangers to the South West of England where raids
were known in a number of coastal communities. In 1627 Barbary Pirates under
command of the Dutch renegade Jan Janszoon operating from the Moroccan port of
Sal√© occupied the island of Lundy. During this time there were reports of
captured slaves being sent to Algiers. Ireland, despite its northern position,
was not immune from attacks by the corsairs. In June 1631 Murat Reis, with
pirates from Algiers and armed troops of the Ottoman Empire, stormed ashore at
the little harbor village of Baltimore, County Cork. They captured almost all
the villagers and took them away to a life of slavery in North Africa. The
prisoners were destined for a variety of fates‚Äîsome lived out their days
chained to the oars as galley slaves, while others would spend long years in
the scented seclusion of the harem or within the walls of the sultan's palace.
Only two of them ever saw Ireland again. Atlantic slave trade. Britain played a
prominent role in the Atlantic slave trade, especially after 1600. Slavery was
a legal institution in all of the 13 American colonies and Canada (acquired by
Britain in 1763). The profits of the slave trade and of West Indian plantations
amounted to 5% of the British economy at the time of the Industrial Revolution.
The Somersett's case in 1772 was generally taken at the time to have decided
that the condition of slavery did not exist under English law in England. In
1785, English poet William Cowper wrote: "We have no slaves at home ‚Äì Then
why abroad? Slaves cannot breathe in England; if their lungs receive our air,
that moment they are free. They touch our country, and their shackles fall.
That's noble, and bespeaks a nation proud. And jealous of the blessing. Spread
it then, And let it circulate through every vein." In 1807, following many
years of lobbying by the Abolitionist movement, the British Parliament voted to
make the slave trade illegal anywhere in the Empire with the Slave Trade Act
1807. Thereafter Britain took a prominent role in combating the trade, and
slavery itself was abolished in the British Empire with the Slavery Abolition
Act 1833. Between 1808 and 1860, the West Africa Squadron seized approximately
1,600 slave ships and freed 150,000 Africans who were aboard. Action was also
taken against African leaders who refused to agree to British treaties to
outlaw the trade, for example against "the usurping King of Lagos", deposed in
1851. Anti-slavery treaties were signed with over 50 African rulers. In 1839,
the world's oldest international human rights organization, Anti-Slavery
International, was formed in Britain by Joseph Sturge, which worked to outlaw
slavery in other countries. In 1811, Arthur William Hodge was the first slave
owner executed for the murder of a slave in the British West Indies. He was
not, however, as some have claimed, the first white person to have been
lawfully executed for the killing of a slave. Pre-industrial Europe. It became
the custom among the Mediterranean powers to sentence condemned criminals to
row in the war-galleys of the state (initially only in time of war). The French
Huguenots filled the galleys after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in
1685 and Camisard rebellion. Galley-slaves lived in unsavoury conditions, so
even though some sentences prescribed a restricted number of years, most rowers
would eventually die, even if they survived shipwreck and slaughter or torture
at the hands of enemies or of pirates. Naval forces often turned 'infidel'
prisoners-of-war into galley-slaves. Several well-known historical figures
served time as galley slaves after being captured by the enemy‚Äîthe Ottoman
corsair and admiral Turgut Reis and the Knights Hospitaller Grand Master Jean
Parisot de la Valette among them. From the 1440s into the 18th century hundreds
of thousands of Ukrainians were sold into slavery to the Turks. In 1575, the
Tatars captured over 35,000 Ukrainians; a 1676 raid took almost 40,000. About
60,000 Ukrainians were captured in 1688; some were ransomed, but most were sold
into slavery. Some of the Roma people were enslaved over five centuries in
Romania until abolition in 1864 (see Slavery in Romania). Denmark-Norway was
the first European country to ban the slave trade. This happened with a decree
issued by the king in 1792, to become fully effective by 1803. Slavery itself
was not banned until 1848. At this time Iceland was a part of Denmark-Norway
but slave trading had been abolished in Iceland in 1117 and had never been
reestablished. Slavery in the French Republic was abolished on 4 February 1794
however it was re-established by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1804. Slavery would be
permanently abolished in the French empire during the French Revolution of
1848. The Haitian Revolution established Haiti as a free republic ruled by
blacks, the first of its kind. At the time of the revolution, Haiti was known
as Saint-Domingue and was a colony of France. Modern Europe. During The
Holocaust, the Germans used slave labor from across occupied Europe to support
their war effort, and numbering perhaps 6 million people. The communist Soviet
Union had 10‚Äì20 million people working in Gulags during its existence. This
camp system was also used to colonize Siberia. Africa. In most African
societies, there was very little difference between the free peasants and the
feudal vassal peasants. Vassals of the Songhay Muslim Empire were used
primarily in agriculture; they paid tribute to their masters in crop and
service but they were slightly restricted in custom and convenience. These
people were more an occupational caste, as their bondage was relative. In the
Kanem Bornu Empire, vassals were three classes beneath the nobles. Marriage
between captor and captive was far from rare, blurring the anticipated roles.
French historian Fernand Braudel noted that slavery was endemic in Africa and
part of the structure of everyday life. "Slavery came in different disguises in
different societies: there were court slaves, slaves incorporated into princely
armies, domestic and household slaves, slaves working on the land, in industry,
as couriers and intermediaries, even as traders" (Braudel 1984 p.¬ 435). During
the 16th century, Europe began to outpace the Arab world in the export traffic,
with its slave traffic from Africa to the Americas. The Dutch imported slaves
from Asia into their colony in South Africa. In 1807 Britain, which held
extensive, although mainly coastal colonial territories on the African
continent (including southern Africa), made the "international" slave trade
illegal, as did the United States in 1808. The end of the slave trade and the
decline of slavery was imposed upon Africa by outside powers. The nature of the
slave societies differed greatly across the continent. There were large
plantations worked by slaves in Egypt, the Sudan and Zanzibar, but this was not
a typical use of slaves in Africa as a whole. In most African slave societies,
slaves were protected and incorporated into the slave-owning family. In
Senegambia, between 1300 and 1900, close to one-third of the population was
enslaved. In early Islamic states of the western Sudan, including Ghana
(750‚Äì1076), Mali (1235‚Äì1645), Segou (1712‚Äì1861), and Songhai
(1275‚Äì1591), about a third of the population were slaves. In Sierra Leone in
the 19th century about half of the population consisted of slaves. In the 19th
century at least half the population was enslaved among the Duala of the
Cameroon, the Igbo and other peoples of the lower Niger, the Kongo, and the
Kasanje kingdom and Chokwe of Angola. Among the Ashanti and Yoruba a third of
the population consisted of slaves. The population of the Kanem was about a
third-slave. It was perhaps 40% in Bornu (1396‚Äì1893). Between 1750 and 1900
from one- to two-thirds of the entire population of the Fulani jihad states
consisted of slaves. The population of the Sokoto caliphate formed by Hausas in
the northern Nigeria and Cameroon was half-slave in the 19th century. It is
estimated that up to 90% of the population of Arab-Swahili Zanzibar was
enslaved. Roughly half the population of Madagascar was enslaved. The Anti-
Slavery Society estimated that there were 2,000,000 slaves in the early 1930s
Ethiopia, out of an estimated population of between 8 and 16 million. Slavery
continued in Ethiopia until the brief Second Italo-Abyssinian War in October
1935, when it was abolished by order of the Italian occupying forces. In
response to pressure by Western Allies of World War II Ethiopia officially
abolished slavery and serfdom after regaining its independence in 1942. On 26
August 1942 Haile Selassie issued a proclamation outlawing slavery. When
British rule was first imposed on the Sokoto Caliphate and the surrounding
areas in northern Nigeria at the turn of the 20th century, approximately 2
million to 2.5 million people there were slaves. Slavery in northern Nigeria
was finally outlawed in 1936. Elikia M'bokolo, April 1998, Le Monde
diplomatique. Quote: "The African continent was bled of its human resources via
all possible routes. Across the Sahara, through the Red Sea, from the Indian
Ocean ports and across the Atlantic. At least ten centuries of slavery for the
benefit of the Muslim countries (from the ninth to the nineteenth)." He
continues: "Four million slaves exported via the Red Sea, another four million
through the Swahili ports of the Indian Ocean, perhaps as many as nine million
along the trans-Saharan caravan route, and eleven to twenty million (depending
on the author) across the Atlantic Ocean" Sub-Saharan Africa. ""To overdraw its
evils is a simple impossibility... We passed a slave woman shot or stabbed
through the body and lying on the path. said an Arab who passed early that
morning had done it in anger at losing the price he had given for her, because
she was unable to walk any longer. We passed a woman tied by the neck to a tree
and dead... We came upon a man dead from starvation... The strangest disease I
have seen in this country seems really to be broken heartedness, and it attacks
free men who have been captured and made slaves."" Livingstone estimated that
80,000 Africans died each year before ever reaching the slave markets of
Zanzibar. Zanzibar was once East Africa's main slave-trading port, and under
Omani Arabs in the 19th century as many as 50,000 slaves were passing through
the city each year. Prior to the 16th century, the bulk of slaves exported from
Africa were shipped from East Africa to the Arabian peninsula. Zanzibar became
a leading port in this trade. Arab slave traders differed from European ones in
that they would often conduct raiding expeditions themselves, sometimes
penetrating deep into the continent. They also differed in that their market
greatly preferred the purchase of female slaves over male ones. The increased
presence of European rivals along the East coast led Arab traders to
concentrate on the overland slave caravan routes across the Sahara from the
Sahel to North Africa. The German explorer Gustav Nachtigal reported seeing
slave caravans departing from Kukawa in Bornu bound for Tripoli and Egypt in
1870. The slave trade represented the major source of revenue for the state of
Bornu as late as 1898. The eastern regions of the Central African Republic have
never recovered demographically from the impact of 19th-century raids from the
Sudan and still have a population density of less than 1 person/km¬≤. During
the 1870s, European initiatives against the slave trade caused an economic
crisis in northern Sudan, precipitating the rise of Mahdist forces. Mahdi's
victory created an Islamic state, one that quickly reinstituted slavery. The
Middle Passage, the crossing of the Atlantic to the Americas, endured by slaves
laid out in rows in the holds of ships, was only one element of the well-known
triangular trade engaged in by Portuguese, Dutch, French and British. Ships
having landed slaves in Caribbean ports would take on sugar, indigo, raw
cotton, and later coffee, and make for Liverpool, Nantes, Lisbon or Amsterdam.
Ships leaving European ports for West Africa would carry printed cotton
textiles, some originally from India, copper utensils and bangles, pewter
plates and pots, iron bars more valued than gold, hats, trinkets, gunpowder and
firearms and alcohol. Tropical shipworms were eliminated in the cold Atlantic
waters, and at each unloading, a profit was made. The Atlantic slave trade
peaked in the late 18th century, when the largest number of slaves were
captured on raiding expeditions into the interior of West Africa. These
expeditions were typically carried out by African kingdoms, such as the Oyo
empire (Yoruba), Kong Empire, Kingdom of Benin, Kingdom of Fouta Djallon,
Kingdom of Fouta Tooro, Kingdom of Koya, Kingdom of Khasso, Kingdom of Kaabu,
Fante Confederacy, Ashanti Confederacy, Aro Confederacy and the kingdom of
Dahomey. Europeans rarely entered the interior of Africa, due to fear of
disease and moreover fierce African resistance. The slaves were brought to
coastal outposts where they were traded for goods. The people captured on these
expeditions were shipped by European traders to the colonies of the New World.
As a result of the War of the Spanish Succession, the United Kingdom obtained
the monopoly ("asiento de negros") of transporting captive Africans to Spanish
America. It is estimated that over the centuries, twelve to twenty million
people were shipped as slaves from Africa by European traders, of whom some 15
percent died during the terrible voyage, many during the arduous journey
through the Middle Passage. The great majority were shipped to the Americas,
but some also went to Europe and Southern Africa. African participation in the
slave trade. Some African states played a role in the slave trade. They would
sell their captives or prisoners of war to European buyers. Selling captives or
prisoners was common practice among Africans and Arabs during that era.
However, as the Atlantic slave trade increased its demand, local systems which
primarily serviced indentured servitude became corrupted and started to supply
the European slave traders, changing social dynamics. It also ultimately
undermined local economies and political stability as villages' vital labor
forces were shipped overseas as slave raids and civil wars became commonplace.
Crimes which were previously punishable by some other punishment became
punishable by enslavement. The prisoners and captives that were sold were
usually from neighboring or enemy ethnic groups. These captive slaves were not
considered as part of the ethnic group or 'tribe' and kings did not have a
particular loyalty to them. At times, kings and chiefs would sell criminals
into slavery so that they could no longer commit crimes in that area. Most
other slaves were obtained from kidnappings, or through raids that occurred at
gunpoint through joint ventures with the Europeans. Some African kings refused
to sell any of their captives or criminals. King Jaja of Opobo, a former slave
himself, completely refused to do business with slavers. Ashanti King Agyeman
Prempeh (Ashanti king, b. 1872) also sacrificed his own freedom so that his
people would not face collective slavery. Before the arrival of the Portuguese,
slavery had already existed in Kingdom of Kongo. Despite its establishment
within his kingdom, Afonso I of Kongo believed that the slave trade should be
subject to Kongo law. When he suspected the Portuguese of receiving illegally
enslaved persons to sell, he wrote letters to the King Jo√£o III of Portugal in
1526 imploring him to put a stop to the practice. The kings of Dahomey sold
their war captives into transatlantic slavery, who otherwise would have been
killed in a ceremony known as the Annual Customs. As one of West Africa's
principal slave states, Dahomey became extremely unpopular with neighbouring
peoples. Like the Bambara Empire to the east, the Khasso kingdoms depended
heavily on the slave trade for their economy. A family's status was indicated
by the number of slaves it owned, leading to wars for the sole purpose of
taking more captives. This trade led the Khasso into increasing contact with
the European settlements of Africa's west coast, particularly the French. Benin
grew increasingly rich during the 16th and 17th centuries on the slave trade
with Europe; slaves from enemy states of the interior were sold, and carried to
the Americas in Dutch and Portuguese ships. The Bight of Benin's shore soon
came to be known as the "Slave Coast". ""The slave trade is the ruling
principle of my people. It is the source and the glory of their wealth‚Ä¶the
mother lulls the child to sleep with notes of triumph over an enemy reduced to
slavery‚Ä¶"" ""We think this trade must go on. That is the verdict of our
oracle and the priests. They say that your country, however great, can never
stop a trade ordained by God himself."" Some historians conclude that the total
loss in persons removed, those who died on the arduous march to coastal slave
marts and those killed in slave raids, far exceeded the 65‚Äì75 million
inhabitants remaining in Sub-Saharan Africa at the trade's end. Others believe
that slavers had a vested interest in capturing rather than killing, and in
keeping their captives alive; and that this coupled with the disproportionate
removal of males and the introduction of new crops from the Americas (cassava,
maize) would have limited general population decline to particular regions of
western Africa around 1760‚Äì1810, and in Mozambique and neighbouring areas
half a century later. There has also been speculation that within Africa,
females were most often captured as brides, with their male protectors being a
"bycatch" who would have been killed if there had not been an export market for
them. During the period from late 19th century and early 20th century, demand
for the labor-intensive harvesting of rubber drove frontier expansion and
slavery. The personal monarchy of Belgian King Leopold II in the Congo Free
State saw mass killings and slavery to extract rubber. Modern times. The
trading of children has been reported in modern Nigeria and Benin. In parts of
Ghana, a family may be punished for an offense by having to turn over a virgin
female to serve as a sex slave within the offended family. In this instance,
the woman does not gain the title or status of "wife". In parts of Ghana, Togo,
and Benin, shrine slavery persists, despite being illegal in Ghana since 1998.
In this system of ritual servitude, sometimes called "trokosi" (in Ghana) or
"voodoosi" in Togo and Benin, young virgin girls are given as slaves to
traditional shrines and are used sexually by the priests in addition to
providing free labor for the shrine. It is estimated that as many as 200,000
black south Sudanese children and women (mostly from the Dinka tribe sold by
the Sudanese Arabs of the north) have been taken into slavery in Sudan during
the Second Sudanese Civil War. In Mauritania it is estimated that up to 600,000
men, women and children, or 20% of the population, are currently enslaved, many
of them used as bonded labor. Slavery in Mauritania was criminalized in August
2007. Evidence emerged in the late 1990s of systematic slavery in cacao
plantations in West Africa; see the chocolate and slavery article. The
Americas. Among indigenous peoples. In Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica the most
common forms of slavery were those of prisoners-of-war and debtors. People
unable to pay back a debt could be sentenced to work as a slave to the person
owed until the debt was worked off. Warfare was important to the Maya society,
because raids on surrounding areas provided the victims required for human
sacrifice, as well as slaves for the construction of temples. Most victims of
human sacrifice were prisoners of war or slaves. According to Aztec writings,
as many as 84,000 people were sacrificed at a temple inauguration in 1487.
Slavery was not usually hereditary; children of slaves were born free. In the
Inca Empire, workers were subject to a "mita" in lieu of taxes which they paid
by working for the government. Each "ayllu", or extended family, would decide
which family member to send to do the work. It is unclear if this labor draft
or corv√©e counts as slavery. The Spanish adopted this system, particularly for
their silver mines in Bolivia. Other slave-owning societies and tribes of the
New World were, for example, the Tehuelche of Patagonia, the Comanche of Texas,
the Caribs of Dominica, the Tupinamb√° of Brazil, the fishing societies, such
as the Yurok, that lived along the coast from what is now Alaska to California,
the Pawnee and Klamath. Many of the indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest
Coast, such as the Haida and Tlingit, were traditionally known as fierce
warriors and slave-traders, raiding as far as California. Slavery was
hereditary, the slaves being prisoners of war. Among some Pacific Northwest
tribes about a quarter of the population were slaves. One slave narrative was
composed by an Englishman, John R. Jewitt, who had been taken alive when his
ship was captured in 1802; his memoir provides a detailed look at life as a
slave, and asserts that a large number were held. Brazil. Slavery was a
mainstay of the Brazilian colonial economy, especially in mining and sugar cane
production. Brazil obtained 38% of all African slaves traded, and more than 3
million slaves were sent to this one country. Starting around 1550, the
Portuguese began to trade African slaves to work the sugar plantations, once
the native Tupi people deteriorated. Although Portuguese Prime Minister
Marqu√™s de Pombal abolished slavery in mainland Portugal on 12 February 1761,
slavery continued in her overseas colonies. Slavery was practiced among all
classes. Slaves were owned by upper and middle classes, by the poor, and even
by other slaves. From S√£o Paulo, the Bandeirantes, adventurers mostly of mixed
Portuguese and native ancestry, penetrated steadily westward in their search
for Indian slaves. Along the Amazon river and its major tributaries, repeated
slaving raids and punitive attacks left their mark. One French traveler in the
1740s described "hundreds of miles of river banks with no sign of human life
and once-thriving villages that were devastated and empty." In some areas of
the Amazon Basin, and particularly among the Guarani of southern Brazil and
Paraguay, the Jesuits had organized their Jesuit Reductions along military
lines to fight the slavers. In the mid-to-late 19th century, many Amerindians
were enslaved to work on rubber plantations. Resistance and abolition. Escaped
slaves formed Maroon communities which played an important role in the
histories of Brazil and other countries such as Suriname, Puerto Rico, Cuba,
and Jamaica. In Brazil, the Maroon villages were called palenques or quilombos.
Maroons survived by growing vegetables and hunting. They also raided
plantations. At these attacks, the maroons would burn crops, steal livestock
and tools, kill slavemasters, and invite other slaves to join their
communities. Jean-Baptiste Debret, a French painter who was active in Brazil in
the first decades of the 19th century, started out with painting portraits of
members of the Brazilian Imperial family, but soon became concerned with the
slavery of both blacks and indigenous inhabitants. His paintings on the subject
(two appear on this page) helped bring attention to the subject in both Europe
and Brazil itself. The Clapham Sect, a group of evangelical reformers,
campaigned during much of the 19th century for the United Kingdom to use its
influence and power to stop the traffic of slaves to Brazil. Besides moral
qualms, the low cost of slave-produced Brazilian sugar meant that British
colonies in the West Indies were unable to match the market prices of Brazilian
sugar, and each Briton was consuming 16¬ pounds (7¬ kg) of sugar a year by the
19th century. This combination led to intensive pressure from the British
government for Brazil to end this practice, which it did by steps over several
decades. First, foreign slave trade was banned in 1850. Then, in 1871, the sons
of the slaves were freed. In 1885, slaves aged over 60 years were freed. The
Paraguayan War contributed to ending slavery, since many slaves enlisted in
exchange for freedom. In Colonial Brazil, slavery was more a social than a
racial condition. In fact, some of the greatest figures of the time, like the
writer Machado de Assis and the engineer Andr√© Rebou√ßas had black ancestry.
Brazil's 1877‚Äì78 "Grande Seca" (Great Drought) in the cotton-growing
northeast led to major turmoil, starvation, poverty and internal migration. As
wealthy plantation holders rushed to sell their slaves south, popular
resistance and resentment grew, inspiring numerous emancipation societies. They
succeeded in banning slavery altogether in the province of Cear√° by 1884.
Slavery was legally ended nationwide on 13 May by the "Lei Aurea" ("Golden
Law") of 1888. In fact, it was an institution in decadence at these times, as
since the 1880s the country had begun to use European immigrant labor instead.
Brazil was the last nation in the Western Hemisphere to abolish slavery. Other
South American countries. During the period from late 19th century and early
20th century, demand for the labor-intensive harvesting of rubber drove
frontier expansion and slavery in Latin America and elsewhere. Indigenous
people were enslaved as part of the rubber boom in Ecuador, Peru, Colombia, and
Brazil. In Central America, rubber tappers participated in the enslavement of
the indigenous Guatuso-Maleku people for domestic service. British and French
Caribbean. Slavery was commonly used in the parts of the Caribbean controlled
by France and the British Empire. The Lesser Antilles islands of Barbados, St.
Kitts, Antigua, Martinique and Guadeloupe, which were the first important slave
societies of the Caribbean, began the widespread use of African slaves by the
end of the 17th century, as their economies converted from sugar production. By
the middle of the 18th century, British Jamaica and French Saint-Domingue had
become the largest slave societies of the region, and the Caribbean was
rivaling Brazil as a destination for enslaved Africans. Due to overwork and
tropical diseases, the death rates for Caribbean slaves were greater than birth
rates. The conditions led to increasing numbers of slave revolts, escaped
slaves forming Maroon communities and fighting guerrilla wars against the
plantation owners. To regularise slavery, in 1685 Louis XIV had enacted the
"code noir", which accorded certain human rights to slaves and responsibilities
to the master, who was obliged to feed, clothe and provide for the general
well-being of his slaves. Free blacks owned one-third of the plantation
property and one-quarter of the slaves in Saint Domingue (later Haiti). Slavery
in the French Republic was abolished on 4 February 1794. When it became clear
that Napoleon intended to re-establish slavery, Dessalines and P√©tion switched
sides, in October 1802. On 1 January 1804, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, the new
leader under the dictatorial 1801 constitution, declared Haiti a free republic.
Thus Haiti became the second independent nation in the Western Hemisphere,
after the United States, and the only successful slave rebellion in world
history. Whitehall in England announced in 1833 that slaves in its territories
would be totally freed by 1840. In the meantime, the government told slaves
they had to remain on their plantations and would have the status of
"apprentices" for the next six years. In Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, on 1 August
1834, an unarmed group of mainly elderly Negroes being addressed by the
Governor at Government House about the new laws, began chanting: "Pas de six
ans. Point de six ans" ("Not six years. No six years"), drowning out the voice
of the Governor. Peaceful protests continued until a resolution to abolish
apprenticeship was passed and "de facto" freedom was achieved. Full
emancipation for all was legally granted ahead of schedule on 1 August 1838,
making Trinidad the first British colony with slaves to completely abolish
slavery. After Great Britain abolished slavery, it began to pressure other
nations to do the same. France, too, abolished slavery. By then Saint-Domingue
had already won its independence and formed the independent Republic of Haiti.
French-controlled islands were then limited to a few smaller islands in the
Lesser Antilles. North America. Early events. The first slaves used by
Europeans in what later became United States territory were among Lucas
V√°squez de Ayll√≥n's colonization attempt of North Carolina in 1526. The
attempt was a failure, lasting only one year; the slaves revolted and fled into
the wilderness to live among the Cofitachiqui people. The first historically
significant slave in what would become the United States was Estevanico, a
Moroccan slave and member of the Narv√°ez expedition in 1528 and acted as a
guide on Fray Marcos de Niza's expedition to find the Seven Cities of Gold in
1539. In 1619 twenty Africans were brought by a Dutch soldier and sold to the
English colony of Jamestown, Virginia as indentured servants. It is possible
that Africans were brought to Virginia prior to this, both because neither John
Rolfe our source on the 1619 shipment nor any contemporary of his ever says
that this was the first contingent of Africans to come to Virginia and because
the 1625 Virginia census lists one black as coming on a ship that appears to
only have landed people in Virginia prior to 1619. The transformation from
indentured servitude to racial slavery happened gradually. It was not until
1661 that a reference to slavery entered into Virginia law, directed at
Caucasian servants who ran away with a black servant. It was not until the
Slave Codes of 1705 that the status of African Americans as slaves would be
sealed. This status would last for another 160 years, until after the end of
the American Civil War with the ratification of the 13th Amendment in December
1865. Only a fraction of the enslaved Africans brought to the New World ended
up in British North America‚Äîperhaps 5%. The vast majority of slaves shipped
across the Atlantic were sent to the Caribbean sugar colonies, Brazil, or
Spanish America. By the 1680s with the consolidation of England's Royal African
Company, enslaved Africans were imported to English colonies in larger numbers,
and the practice continued to be protected by the English Crown. Colonists
began purchasing slaves in larger numbers. Development of slavery. The shift
from indentured servants to African slaves was prompted by a dwindling class of
former servants who had worked through the terms of their indentures and thus
became competitors to their former masters. These newly freed servants were
rarely able to support themselves comfortably, and the tobacco industry was
increasingly dominated by large planters. This caused domestic unrest
culminating in Bacon's Rebellion. Eventually, chattel slavery became the norm
in regions dominated by plantations. Many slaves in British North America were
owned by plantation owners who lived in Britain. The British courts had made a
series of contradictory rulings on the legality of slavery which encouraged
several thousand slaves to flee the newly independent United States as refugees
along with the retreating British in 1783. The British courts having ruled in
1772 that such slaves could not be forcibly returned to North America, the
British government resettled them as free men in Sierra Leone. Several slave
rebellions took place during the 17th and 18th centuries. Early United States
law. Through the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 under the Congress of the
Confederation, slavery was prohibited in the territories north west of the Ohio
River. By 1804, abolitionists succeeded in passing legislation that would
eventually (in conjunction with the 13th amendment) emancipate the slaves in
every state north of the Ohio River and the Mason-Dixon Line. However,
emancipation in the free states was so gradual that both New York and
Pennsylvania listed slaves in their 1840 census returns, and a small number of
black slaves were held in New Jersey in 1860. The importation or export of
slaves was banned on 1 January 1808; but not the internal slave trade. Despite
the actions of abolitionists, free blacks were subject to racial segregation in
the Northern states. Slavery was legal in most of Canada until 1833, but after
that it offered a haven for hundreds of runaway slaves. Refugees from slavery
fled the South across the Ohio River to the North via the Underground Railroad.
Midwestern state governments asserted States Rights arguments to refuse federal
jurisdiction over fugitives. Some juries exercised their right of jury
nullification and refused to convict those indicted under the Fugitive Slave
Act of 1850. After the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1854, armed
conflict broke out in Kansas Territory, where the question of whether it would
be admitted to the Union as a slave state or a free state had been left to the
inhabitants. The radical abolitionist John Brown was active in the mayhem and
killing in "Bleeding Kansas." The true turning point in public opinion is
better fixed at the Lecompton Constitution fraud. Pro-slavery elements in
Kansas had arrived first from Missouri and quickly organized a territorial
government that excluded abolitionists. Through the machinery of the territory
and violence, the pro-slavery faction attempted to force an unpopular pro-
slavery constitution through the state. This infuriated Northern Democrats, who
supported popular sovereignty, and was exacerbated by the Buchanan
administration reneging on a promise to submit the constitution to a referendum
‚Äì which it would surely fail. Anti-slavery legislators took office under the
banner of the newly formed Republican Party. The Supreme Court in the Dred
Scott decision of 1857 asserted that one could take one's property anywhere,
even if one's property was chattel and one crossed into a free territory. It
also asserted that African Americans could not be federal citizens. Outraged
critics across the North denounced these episodes as the latest of the Slave
Power (the politically organized slave owners) taking more control of the
nation. Civil War. Approximately one Southern family in four held slaves prior
to war. According to the 1860 United States Census, about 385,000 individuals
(i.e. 1.4% of White Americans in the country, or 4.8% of southern whites) owned
one or more slaves. and the slave population in the United States stood at four
million. 95% of blacks lived in the South, comprising one third of the
population there as opposed to 1% of the population of the North. Consequently,
fears of eventual emancipation were much greater in the South than in the
North. In the election of 1860, the Republicans swept Abraham Lincoln into the
Presidency (with only 39.8% of the popular vote) and legislators into Congress.
Lincoln however, did not appear on the ballots in most southern states and his
election split the nation along sectional lines. After decades of controlling
the Federal Government, several of the southern states declared they had
seceded from the U.S. (the Union) in an attempt to form the Confederate States
of America. Northern leaders like Lincoln viewed the prospect of a new Southern
nation, with control over the Mississippi River and the West, as unacceptable.
This led to the outbreak of the Civil War, which spelled the end for chattel
slavery in America. However, in August 1862, Lincoln wrote to editor Horace
Greeley that despite his own moral objection to slavery, the objective of the
war was to save the Union and not either to save or to destroy slavery .
Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 was a powerful move that proclaimed
freedom for slaves within the Confederacy as soon as the Union Army arrived;
Lincoln had no power to free slaves in the border states or the rest of the
Union, so he promoted the Thirteenth Amendment, which freed all the remaining
slaves in December 1865. The proclamation made the abolition of slavery an
official war goal and it was implemented as the Union captured territory from
the Confederacy. Slaves in many parts of the south were freed by Union armies
or when they simply left their former owners. Over 150,000 joined the Union
Army and Navy as soldiers and sailors. The remaining slaves within the United
States remained enslaved until the final ratification of the Thirteenth
Amendment to the Constitution on 6 December 1865 (with final recognition of the
amendment on 18 December), eight months after the cessation of hostilities.
Only in Kentucky did a significant slave population remain by that time,
although there were some in West Virginia and Delaware. After the failure of
Reconstruction, freed slaves in the United States were treated as second class
citizens. For decades after their emancipation, many former slaves living in
the South sharecropped and had a low standard of living. In some states, it was
only after the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 60s that blacks obtained
legal protection from racial discrimination ("see segregation"). Oceania. In
the first half of the 19th century, small-scale slave raids took place across
Polynesia to supply labor and sex workers for the whaling and sealing trades,
with examples from both the westerly and easterly extremes of the Polynesian
triangle. By the 1860s this had grown to a larger scale operation with Peruvian
slave raids in the South Sea Islands to collect labor for the guano industry.
Hawaii. Ancient Hawaii was a caste society. People were born into specific
social classes. Kauwa were the outcast or slave class. They are believed to
have been war captives, or the descendents of war captives. Marriage between
higher castes and the kauwa was strictly forbidden. The kauwa worked for the
chiefs and were often used as human sacrifices at the "luakini heiau". (They
were not the only sacrifices; law-breakers of all castes or defeated political
opponents were also acceptable as victims.) New Zealand. In traditional MƒÅori
society of Aotearoa, prisoners of war became "taurekareka", slaves, unless
released, ransomed or tortured. With some exceptions, the child of a slave
remained a slave. As far as it is possible to tell, slavery seems to have
increased in the early 19th century, as a result of increased numbers of
prisoners being taken by MƒÅori military leaders such as Hongi Hika and Te
Rauparaha in the Musket Wars, the need for labor to supply whalers and traders
with food, flax and timber in return for western goods, and the missionary
condemnation of cannibalism. Slavery was outlawed when the British annexed New
Zealand in 1840, immediately prior to the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi,
although it did not end completely until government was effectively extended
over the whole of the country with the defeat of the Kingi movement in the Wars
of the mid-1860s. Chatham Islands. One group of Polynesians who migrated to the
Chatham Islands became the Moriori who developed a largely pacifist culture. It
was originally speculated that they settled the Chathams direct from Polynesia,
but it is now widely believed they were disaffected MƒÅori who emigrated from
the South Island of New Zealand. Their pacifism left the Moriori unable to
defend themselves when the islands were invaded by mainland MƒÅori in the
1830s. Some 300 Moriori men, women and children were massacred and the
remaining 1,200 to 1,300 survivors were enslaved. Rapa Nui / Easter Island. The
isolated island of Rapa Nui/Easter Island was inhabited by the Rapanui, who
suffered a series of slave raids from 1805 or earlier, culminating in a near
genocidal experience in the 1860s. The 1805 raid was by American sealers and
was one of a series that changed the attitude of the islanders to outside
visitors, with reports in the 1820s and 1830s that all visitors received a
hostile reception. In December 1862, Peruvian slave raiders took between 1,400
and 2,000 islanders back to Peru to work in the guano industry; this was about
a third of the island's population and included much of the island's
leadership, the last "ariki-mau" and possibly the last who could read
Rongorongo. After intervention by the French ambassador in Lima, the last 15
survivors were returned to the island, but brought with them smallpox, which
further devastated the island. Abolitionist movements. Slavery has existed, in
one form or another, throughout the whole of human history. So, too, have
movements to free large or distinct groups of slaves. However, abolitionism
should be distinguished from efforts to help a particular group of slaves, or
to restrict one practice, such as the slave trade. Drescher (2009) provides a
model for the history of the abolition of slavery, emphasizing its origins in
Western Europe. Around the year 1500, slavery had virtually died out in Western
Europe, but was a normal phenomenon practically everywhere else. The imperial
powers, France, Spain, Britain, Portugal, the Netherlands and a few others,
built worldwide empires based primarily on plantation agriculture using slaves
imported from Africa. However, the powers took care to minimize the presence of
slavery in their homelands. During the "Age of Revolutions" (c. 1770‚Äì1815),
Britain abolished its international slave trade and imposed similar
restrictions upon other western nations; the U.S. followed suit in 1808.
Although there were numerous slave revolts in the Caribbean, the only
successful uprising came in the French colony of St. Domingue, where the slaves
rose up, killed the mulattoes and whites, and established the independent
Republic of Haiti. The continuing profitability of slave-based plantations and
the threats of race war slowed the development of abolition movements during
the first half of the 19th century. These movements were strongest in Britain,
and after 1840 in the United States, in both instances they were based on
evangelical religious enthusiasm that stressed the horrible impact on the
slaves themselves. The Northern states of the United States abolished slavery,
partly in response to the Declaration of Independence, between 1777 and 1804.
Britain ended slavery in its empire in the 1830s. However the plantation
economies of the southern United States, based on cotton, and those in Brazil
and Cuba, based on sugar, expanded and grew even more profitable. The bloody
American Civil War ended slavery in the United States in the 1860s; the system
ended in Cuba and Brazil in the 1880s because it was no longer profitable for
the owners. Slavery continued to exist in Africa, where Arab slave traders
raided black areas for new captives to be sold in the system. European colonial
rule and diplomatic pressure slowly put an end to the trade, and eventually to
the practice of slavery itself. Britain. In 1772, the Somersett Case (R. v.
Knowles, ex parte Somersett) of the English Court of King's Bench ruled that
slavery was unlawful in England (although not elsewhere in the British Empire).
A similar case, that of Joseph Knight, took place in Scotland five years later
and ruled slavery to be contrary to the law of Scotland. Following the work of
campaigners in the United Kingdom, such as William Wilberforce and Thomas
Clarkson, the Act for the Abolition of the Slave Trade was passed by Parliament
on 25 March 1807, coming into effect the following year. The act imposed a fine
of ¬£100 for every slave found aboard a British ship. The intention was to
outlaw entirely the Atlantic slave trade within the whole British Empire. The
significance of the abolition of the British slave trade lay in the number of
people hitherto sold and carried by British slave vessels. Britain shipped
2,532,300 Africans across the Atlantic, equalling 41% of the total transport of
6,132,900 individuals. This made the British empire the biggest slave-trade
contributor in the world due to the magnitude of the empire. A fact that made
the abolition act all the more damaging to the global trade of slaves.Paul E.
Lovejoy: 'The Volume of the Atlantic Slave Trade: A Synthesis.' "The Journal of
African History", Vol. 23, No. 4 (1982). The Slavery Abolition Act, passed on
23 August 1833, outlawed slavery itself in the British colonies. On 1 August
1834 all slaves in the British West Indies, were emancipated, but still
indentured to their former owners in an apprenticeship system. The intention
of, was to educate former slaves to a trade but instead allowed slave owners to
maintain ownership illegally. The act was finally repealed in 1838. Britain
abolished slavery in both Hindu and Muslim India by the Indian Slavery Act V.
of 1843. Domestic slavery practised by the educated African coastal elites (as
well as interior traditional rulers) in Sierra Leone was abolished in 1928. A
study found practices of domestic slavery still widespread in rural areas in
the 1970s. France. There were slaves in mainland France (especially in trade
ports such as Nantes or Bordeaux)., but the institution was never officially
authorized there. The legal case of Jean Boucaux in 1739 clarified the unclear
legal position of possible slaves in France, and was followed by laws that
established registers for slaves in mainland France, who were limited to a
three-year stay, for visits or learning a trade. Unregistered "slaves" were
regarded as free. However, slavery was of vital importance in France's
Caribbean possessions, especially Saint-Domingue. In 1793, influenced by the
French Declaration of the Rights of Man of August 1789 and alarmed as the
massive slave revolt of August 1791 that had become the Haitian Revolution
threatened to ally itself with the British, the French Revolutionary
commissioners Sonthonax and Polverel declared general emancipation to reconcile
them with France. In Paris, on 4 February 1794, Abb√© Gr√©goire and the
Convention ratified this action by officially abolishing slavery in all French
territories outside mainland France, freeing all the slaves both for moral and
security reasons. Napoleon sent troops to the Caribbean in 1802 to try to re-
establish slavery due to the economic stress France was suffering while
fighting all over Europe. They succeeded in Guadeloupe, but the ex-slaves of
Saint-Domingue defeated the French corps that was sent and declared
independence. This colony became Haiti, the first black republic, on 1 January
1804, with at its head the leader of the revolt, Toussaint Louverture. Slavery
in the French colonies was finally abolished only in 1849. United States. In
1688, four German Quakers in Germantown presented a protest against the
institution of slavery to their local Quaker Meeting. It was ignored for 150
years but in 1844 it was rediscovered and was popularized by the abolitionist
movement. The 1688 Petition was the first American public document of its kind
to protest slavery, and in addition was one of the first public documents to
define universal human rights. The American Colonization Society, the primary
vehicle for returning black Americans to greater freedom in Africa, established
the colony of Liberia in 1821‚Äì22, on the premise former American slaves would
have greater freedom and equality there. The ACS assisted in the movement of
thousands of African Americans to Liberia, with its founder Henry Clay stating;
"unconquerable prejudice resulting from their color, they never could
amalgamate with the free whites of this country. It was desirable, therefore,
as it respected them, and the residue of the population of the country, to
drain them off". Abraham Lincoln, an enthusiastic supporter of Clay, adopted
his position on returning the blacks to their own land. Slaves in the United
States who escaped ownership would often make their way to Canada via the
"Underground Railroad". The more famous of the African American abolitionists
include former slaves Harriet Tubman, Sojourner Truth and Frederick Douglass.
Many more people who opposed slavery and worked for abolition were northern
whites, such as William Lloyd Garrison and John Brown. Slavery was legally
abolished in 1865 by the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States
Constitution. While abolitionists agreed on the evils of slavery, there were
differing opinions on what should happen after African Americans were freed. By
the time of Emancipation, African-Americans were now native to the United
States and did not want to leave. Most believed that their labor had made the
land theirs as well as that of the whites. Congress of Vienna. The "Declaration
of the Powers, on the Abolition of the Slave Trade, of 8 February 1815" (Which
also formed ACT, No. XV. of the Final Act of the Congress of Vienna of the same
year) included in its first sentence the concept of the "principles of humanity
and universal morality" as justification for ending a trade that was "odious in
its continuance". Twentieth century worldwide. The 1926 Slavery Convention, an
initiative of the League of Nations, was a turning point in banning global
slavery. Article 4 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted in
1948 by the UN General Assembly, explicitly banned slavery. The United Nations
1956 Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery was convened to
outlaw and ban slavery worldwide, including child slavery. In December 1966,
the UN General Assembly adopted the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights, which was developed from the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights. Article 8 of this international treaty bans slavery. The treaty came
into force in March 1976 after it had been ratified by 35 nations. As of
November 2003, 104 nations had ratified the treaty. According to the British
Anti-Slavery Society, "Although there is no longer any state which recognizes
any claim by a person to a right of property over another, there are an
estimated 27 million people throughout the world, mainly children, in
conditions of slavery."
