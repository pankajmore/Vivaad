Germanic peoples The Germanic peoples (also called Teutonic or Gothic in older
literature) are an Indo-European ethno-linguistic group of Northern European
origin, identified by their use of the Germanic languages which diversified out
of Proto-Germanic during the Pre-Roman Iron Age. The term "Germanic" originated
in classical times, when groups of tribes were referred to using this term by
Roman authors. For them, the term was not necessarily based upon language, but
rather referred to tribal groups and alliances who were considered less
civilized, and more physically hardened, than the Celtic Gauls living in the
region of modern France. Tribes referred to as Germanic in that period lived
generally to the north and east of the Gauls. Modern Germanic peoples include
the Scandinavians (Norwegians, Swedish, Danish, Icelanders, and Faroese),
Germans, Austrians, Alemannic Swiss, Liechtensteiners, Luxembourgers, the
Dutch, Flemings, Afrikaners, Frisians, the English and others who still speak
languages derived from the ancestral Germanic dialects. Ethnonym. Germanic. The
Latin ethnonym ""Germani"" seems to be attested in the "Fasti Capitolini"
inscription for the year 222 BCE - "de Galleis Insvbribvs et Germ(aneis)" -
where it may simply refer to "related" peoples, namely related to the Gauls.
Furthermore, since the inscriptions were erected only in 17 to 18 BCE, the word
may be a later addition to the text. Another early mentioning of the name, this
time by Poseidonios (writing around 80 BCE), is also dubious, as it only
survives in a quotation by Athenaios (writing around 190 CE); the mention of
"Germani" in this context was more likely inserted by Athenaios rather than by
Poseidonios himself. The writer who apparently introduced the name "Germani"
into the corpus of classical literature is Julius Caesar. He uses "Germani" in
two slightly differing ways: First, "Germania" was a geographical area of land
on the east bank of the Rhine from Gaul, and outside Roman control. This usage
of the word is the origin of the modern concept of Germanic languages, but it
was not defined strictly by language. Under other classical authors this
sometimes included regions of Sarmatia as well as an area under Roman control
on the west bank of the Rhine. Also, at least in the south there were Celtic
peoples still living east of the Rhine and north of the Alps. Caesar, Tacitus
and others did note differences of culture which could be found on the east of
the Rhine. But all of these cultural notes were around the theme that this was
a wild and dangerous region, less civilised than Gaul, and requiring of
military vigilance in Rome and Gaul. Second, Caesar uses the term "Germani",
for a very specific tribal grouping in northeastern Belgic Gaul, west of the
Rhine, the largest part of which were the Eburones, making clear that he was
using the name in the local way. These are the so-called "Germani Cisrhenani".
Tacitus suggests that this was the original way the word ""Germani"" was used
â€“ as the name of a single tribal nation, ancestral to the Tungri (who lived
in the same area as the earlier "Germani" reported by Caesar), and not a whole
race ("gentis"). He also suggested that two large Belgic tribes neighbouring
Caesar's "Germani", the Nervii and the Treveri, liked to call themselves
Germanic in his time, in order not to be associated with Gaulish indolence.
Caesar described this group of tribes both as Belgic Gauls, and "Germani".
Gauls are associated with Celtic languages, and the term "Germani" is
associated with Germanic languages, but Caesar did not discuss languages in
detail (though he did say that Belgic Gaul was different from Celtic Gaul in
language). He does not describe these tribes as recent immigrants, saying that
they had defended themselves some generations earlier from the invading Cimbri
and Teutones. (He thereby distinguished them from the neighbouring Aduatuci,
who he did not call "Germani", but who were descended from those Cimbri and
Teutones.) But he also indicated that the Germani were seen as having ancestry
over the Rhine. It has been claimed, for example by Maurits Gysseling, that the
placenames of this region show evidence of an early presence of Germanic
languages, already in the 2nd century BCE. Celtic culture and language was
however clearly influential also, as can be seen in the tribal name of the
Eburones, their kings' names, Ambiorix and Cativolcus, and also the material
culture of the region. (In these early records of apparent Germanic tribes,
tribal leader names of the Cimbri and Sigambri, and tribal names such as
Tencteri and Usipetes, are also apparently Gaulish, even coming from the east
of the Rhine.) The etymology of the word "Germani" is uncertain. The likeliest
theory so far proposed is that it comes from a Gaulish compound of *"ger"
"near" + *"mani" "men", comparable to Welsh "ger" "near" (prep.), Old Irish
"gair" "neighbor", Irish "gar-" (prefix) "near", "garach" "neighborly". Another
Celtic possibility is that the name meant "noisy"; cf. Breton/Cornish "garm"
"shout", Irish "gairm" "call". However, here the vowel does not match, nor does
the vowel length (contrast with inscriptional "Garmangabi" (UK) and "Garma"
(Alise, G-257)). Others have proposed a Germanic etymology *"gÄ“r"-"manni",
"spear men", cf. Dutch "geer", German "Ger", Old Norse "geirr". However, the
form "gÄ“r" (from PGmc *"gaizaz") seems far too advanced phonetically for the
1st century, has a long vowel where a short one is expected, and the Latin form
has a simplex -"n"-, not a geminate. The term "Germani", therefore, probably
applied to a small group of tribes in northeastern Gaul who may or may not have
spoken a Germanic language, and whose links to Germania are unclear.
Apparently, the Germanic tribes did not have a single self-designation that
included all Germanic-speaking people but excluded all non-Germanic people.
Non-Germanic peoples (primarily Celtic, Roman, Greek, the citizens of the Roman
Empire), on the other hand, were called *"walhaz" (continued by Wales, ,
Cornwall, Walloons, Vlachs). Yet, the name of the "Suebi" â€” which designated
a larger group of tribes and was used by Caesar somewhat indescriminantly when
describing Germanic tribes east of the Rhine â€” was possibly a Germanic word
which was used to describe a broad classification of Germanic speakers (*"swÄ“-
ba-" "authentic"). Teutonic, "Deutsch". Trying to identify a contemporary
vernacular term and the associated nation with a classical name, Latin writers
from the 10th century onwards used the learned adjective "teutonicus"
(originally derived from the Teutones) to refer to East Francia (""Regnum
Teutonicum"") and its inhabitants. This usage is still partly present in modern
English; hence the English use of "Teutons" in reference to the Germanic
peoples in general besides the specific tribe of the Teutons defeated at the
Battle of Aquae Sextiae in 102 BCE. The generic *"Ã¾iuda-" "people" occurs in
many personal names such as "Thiud-reks" and also in the ethnonym of the
"Swedes" from a cognate of Old English "Sweo-Ã°Ä“od" and Old Norse: "Sui-
Ã¾iÃ³Ã°" (see e.g. SÃ¶ Fv1948;289). Additionally, "Ã¾iuda-" appears in "Angel-
Ã°Ä“od" ("Anglo-Saxon people") and "Gut-Ã¾iuda" ("Gothic people"). The
adjective derived from this noun, *"Ã¾iudiskaz", "popular", was later used with
reference to the language of the people in contrast to the Latin language
(earliest recorded example 786). The word is continued in German "Deutsch"
(meaning German), English "Dutch", Dutch "Duits" and "Diets" (the latter
referring to the historic name for Dutch or Middle Dutch, the former meaning
German), Italian "tedesco" (meaning German), Swedish/Danish/Norwegian "tysk"
(meaning German), Dutch Low Saxon "Duuts", and Middle Low German "dudesch"
meaning both Low German and the whole of Dutch/German/Low German, as well its
descendant, modern Low German "dÃ¼tsch", meaning only Standard High German.
Classification. The Sons of Mannus, Istvaeones, Irminones, and Ingvaeones are
collectively called West Germanic tribes. In addition, those Germanic people
who remained in Scandinavia are referred to as North Germanic. These groups all
developed separate dialects, the basis for the differences among Germanic
languages down to the present day. The division of peoples into West Germanic,
East Germanic, and North Germanic is a modern linguistic classification. Many
Greek scholars only classified Celts and Scythians in the Northwest and
Northeast of the Mediterranean and this classification was widely maintained in
Greek literature until Late Antiquity. Latin-Greek ethnographers (Tacitus,
Pliny the Elder, Ptolemy, and Strabo) mentioned in the first two centuries the
names of peoples they classified as Germanic along the Elbe, the Rhine, and the
Danube, the Vistula and on the Baltic Sea. Tacitus mentioned 40, Ptolemy 69
peoples. Classical ethnography applied the name "Suebi" to many tribes in the
1st century, apparently partly replacing the word ""Germanic"". After the
Marcomannic wars the Gothic name steadily gained importance. For the end of the
5th century the Gothic name can be used â€“ according to the historical sources
â€“ for such different peoples like the Goths in Gaul, Iberia and Italy, the
Vandals in Africa, the Gepids along the Tisza and the Danube, the Rugians,
Sciri and Burgundians, even the Iranian Alans. Though speaking Germanic
languages, these peoples were sometimes classified as Scythians and often said
to descend from the ancient Getae (most important: Cassiodor/Jordanes, Getica
around 550). History. Origins. Regarding the question of ethnic origins,
evidence developed by archaeologists and linguists suggests that a people or
group of peoples sharing a common material culture dwelt in a region defined by
the Nordic Bronze Age culture between 1700 BCE and 600 BCE. The Germanic tribes
then inhabited southern Scandinavia, Schleswig-Holstein and Hamburg, but
subsequent Iron Age cultures of the same region, like Wessenstedt (800 to 600
BCE) and Jastorf, are also in consideration. The change of Proto-Indo-European
to Proto-Germanic has been defined by the first sound shift (or Grimm's law)
and must have occurred when mutually intelligible dialects or languages in a
Sprachbund were still able to convey such a change to the whole region. So far
it has been impossible to date this event conclusively. The precise interaction
between these peoples is not known; however, they are tied together and
influenced by regional features and migration patterns linked to prehistoric
cultures like HÃ¼gelgrÃ¤ber, Urnfield, and La Tene. A deteriorating climate in
Scandinavia around 850 BCE to 760 BCE and a later and more rapid one around 650
BCE might have triggered migrations to the coast of Eastern Germany and further
toward the Vistula. A contemporary northern expansion of Hallstatt drew part of
these peoples into the Celtic hemisphere, including nordwestblock areas and the
region of Elp culture (1800 BCE to 800 BCE). At around this time, this culture
became influenced by Hallstatt techniques for extracting bog iron from the ore
in peat bogs, ushering in the Pre-Roman Iron Age. Early Iron Age. Archeological
evidence suggests a relatively uniform Germanic people were located at about
750 BCE from the Netherlands to the Vistula and Southern Scandinavia. In the
west the coastal floodplains were populated for the first time, since in
adjacent higher grounds the population had increased and the soil became
exhausted. At about 250 BCE, some expansion to the south had occurred and five
general groups can be distinguished: "North Germanic" in southern Scandinavia,
excluding Jutland; "North Sea Germanic", along the North Sea and in Jutland;
"Rhine-Weser Germanic", along the middle Rhine and Weser; "Elbe Germanic",
along the middle Elbe; and "East Germanic", between the middle Oder and the
Vistula. This concurs with linguistic evidence pointing at the development of
five linguistic groups, mutually linked into sets of two to four groups that
shared linguistic innovations. This period witnessed the advent of Celtic
culture of Hallstatt and La Tene signature in previous Northern Bronze Age
territory, especially to the western extends. However, some proposals suggest
this Celtic superstrate was weak, while the general view in the Netherlands
holds that this Celtic influence did not involve intrusions at all and assume
fashion and a local development from Bronze Age culture. It is generally
accepted such a Celtic superstratum was virtually absent to the East, featuring
the Germanic Wessenstedt and Jastorf cultures. The Celtic influence and
contacts between Gaulish and early Germanic culture along the Rhine is assumed
as the source of a number of Celtic loanwords in Proto-Germanic. Looijenga,
Jantina Helena, "Runes around the North Sea and on the Continent" AD 150-700,
II.2, From the pre-Roman Iron Age to the late-Germanic Iron Age, University of
Groningen, 1997 The first "Germani" in Roman ethnography cannot be clearly
identified as either Germanic or Celtic in the modern ethno-linguistic sense,
and it has been generally held the traditional clear cut division along the
Rhine between both ethnic groups was primarily motivated by Roman politics.
Caesar described the Eburones as a Germanic tribe on the Gallic side of the
Rhine, and held other tribes in the neighbourhood as merely calling themselves
of Germanic stock. Even though names like Eburones and Ambiorix were Celtic
and, archeologically, this area shows strong Celtic influences, the problem is
difficult. Some 20th-century writers consider the possibility of a separate
"Nordwestblock" identity of the tribes settled along the Rhine at the time,
assuming the arrival of a Germanic superstrate from the 1st century BCE and a
subsequent "Germanization" or language replacement through the "elite-
dominance" model. However, immigration of Germanic Batavians from Hessen in the
northern extent of this same tribal region is, archeologically speaking, hardly
noticeable and certainly did not populate an exterminated country, very unlike
Tacitus suggested. Here, probably due to the local indigenous pastoral way of
life, the acceptance of Roman culture turned out to be particularly slow and,
contrary to expected, the indigenous culture of the previous Eburones rather
seems to have absorbed the intruding (Batavian) element, thus making it very
hard to define the real extents of the pre-Roman Germanic indigenous
territories. The Pytheas Trip. The first news about the Germanic world are
contained in the lost Pytheas work. It is believed that Pytheas circumnavigated
Northern Europe, and his observations about the geographical environment,
traditions and culture of the Northern European populations were a central
source of information to later historians, possibly the only source. Authors
such as Strabo, Pliny and Diodorus cite Pytheas in disbelief, although Pytheas'
observations are substantially correct. Though Pytheas was not the first
explorer of those lands (for example Himilco, Phoenicians, Tartessians), he was
the first to describe these populations, and it is fair to say that much of the
Germanic peoples' history enters into view through Pytheas. Roman Empire
period. Germanic expansions during early Roman times are known only generally,
but it is clear that the forebears of the Goths were settled on the southern
Baltic shore by 100 CE. The early Germanic tribes are assumed to have spoken
mutually intelligible dialects, in the sense that Germanic languages derive
from a single earlier parent language. No written records of such a parent
language exist. From what we know of scanty early written material, by the 5th
century the Germanic languages were already "sufficiently different to render
communication between the various peoples impossible". Some evidence point to a
common pantheon made up of several different chronological layers. However, as
for mythology only the Scandinavian one (see Germanic mythology) is
sufficiently known. Some traces of common traditions between various tribes are
indicated by "Beowulf" and the "Volsunga saga". One indication of their shared
identity is their common Germanic name for "non"-Germanic peoples, "*walhaz"
(plural of *walhoz), from which the local names Welsh, Wallis, Walloon, Vlach
and others were derived. An indication of an ethnic unity is the fact that the
Romans knew them as one and gave them a common name, Germani (this is the
source of our "German" and "Germanic", see Etymology above), although it was
well known for the Romans to give geographical rather than cultural names to
peoples. The very extensive practice of cremation deprives us of
anthropological comparative material for the earliest periods to support claims
of a longstanding ethnic isolation of a common (Nordic) strain. In the absence
of large-scale political unification, such as that imposed forcibly by the
Romans upon the peoples of Italy, the various tribes remained free, led by
their own hereditary or chosen leaders. Collision with Rome. By the late 2nd
century BCE, Roman authors recount, Gaul, Italy and Hispania were invaded by
migrating Germanic tribes. This culminated in military conflict with the armies
of the Roman Republic, in particular those of the Roman Consul Gaius Marius.
Six decades later, Julius Caesar invoked the threat of such attacks as one
justification for his annexation of Gaul to Rome. As Rome expanded to the Rhine
and Danube rivers, it incorporated many Celtic societies into the Empire. The
tribal homelands to the north and east emerged collectively in the records as
Germania. The peoples of this area were sometimes at war with Rome, but also
engaged in complex and long-term trade relations, military alliances, and
cultural exchanges with Rome as well. The Cimbri and Teutoni incursions into
Roman Italy were thrust back in 101 BCE. These invasions were written up by
Caesar and others as presaging of a Northern danger for the Roman Republic, a
danger that should be controlled. In the Augustean period there was â€” as a
result of Roman activity as far as the Elbe River â€” a first definition of the
"Germania magna": from Rhine and Danube in the West and South to the Vistula
and the Baltic Sea in the East and North. Caesar's wars helped establish the
term Germania. The initial purpose of the Roman campaigns was to protect
Transalpine Gaul by controlling the area between the Rhine and the Elbe. In 9
CE, a revolt of their Germanic subjects headed by the supposed Roman ally,
Arminius, (along with his decisive defeat of Publius Quinctilius Varus and the
destruction of 3 Roman legions in the surprise attack on the Romans at the
Battle of the Teutoburg Forest) ended in the withdrawal of the Roman frontier
to the Rhine. At the end of the 1st century, two provinces west of the Rhine
called Germania inferior and Germania superior were established. Important
medieval cities like Aachen, Cologne, Trier, Mainz, Worms and Speyer were part
of these Roman provinces. The "Germania" by Gaius Cornelius Tacitus, an
ethnographic work on the diverse group of Germanic tribes outside of the Roman
Empire, is our most important source on the Germanic peoples of the 1st
century. Migration Period. During the 5th century, as the Western Roman Empire
lost military strength and political cohesion, numerous Germanic peoples, under
pressure from population growth and invading Asian groups, began migrating en
masse in far and diverse directions, taking them to Great Britain and far south
through present day Continental Europe to the Mediterranean and northern
Africa. Over time, this wandering meant intrusions into other tribal
territories, and the ensuing wars for land escalated with the dwindling amount
of unoccupied territory. Wandering tribes then began staking out permanent
homes as a means of protection. Much of this resulted in fixed settlements from
which many, under a powerful leader, expanded outwards. A defeat meant either
scattering or merging with the dominant tribe, and this continual process of
assimilation was how nations were formed. In Denmark the Jutes merged with the
Danes, in Sweden the Geats and Gutes merged with the Swedes. In England, the
Angles merged with the Saxons and other groups (notably the Jutes), as well as
absorbing some natives, to form the Anglo-Saxons. A direct result of the Roman
retreat was the disappearance of imported products like ceramics and coins, and
a return to virtually unchanged local Iron Age production methods. According to
recent views this has caused confusion for decades, and theories assuming the
total abandonment of the coastal regions to account for an archaeological time
gap that never existed have been renounced. Instead, it has been confirmed that
the Frisian graves had been used without interruption between the 4th and 9th
centuries and that inhabited areas show continuity with the Roman period in
revealing coins, jewellery and ceramics of the 5th century. Also, people
continued to live in the same three-aisled farmhouse, while to the east
completely new types of buildings arose. More to the south, in Belgium,
archeological results of this period point to immigration from the north. Role
in the Fall of Rome. Some of the Germanic tribes are frequently credited in
popular depictions of the decline of the Roman Empire in the late 5th century.
Professional historians and archaeologists have since the 1950s shifted their
interpretations in such a way that the Germanic peoples are no longer seen as
"invading" a decaying empire but as being "co-opted" into helping defend
territory the central government could no longer adequately administer.
Individuals and small groups from Germanic tribes had long been recruited from
the territories beyond the "limes" (i.e., the regions just outside the Roman
Empire), and some of them had risen high in the command structure of the army.
Then the Empire recruited entire tribal groups under their native leaders as
officers. Assisting with defense eventually shifted into administration and
then outright rule, as Roman government passed into the hands of Germanic
leaders. Odoacer, who deposed Romulus Augustulus, is the ultimate example. The
presence of successor states controlled by a nobility from one of the Germanic
tribes is evident in the 6th century â€“ even in Italy, the former heart of the
Empire, where Odoacer was followed by Theodoric the Great, king of the
Ostrogoths, who was regarded by Roman citizens and Gothic settlers alike as
legitimate successor to the rule of Rome and Italy. Early Middle Ages. The
transition of the Migration period to the Middle Ages proper takes place over
the course of the second half of the 1st millennium. It is marked by the
Christianization of the Germanic peoples and the formation of stable kingdoms
replacing the mostly tribal structures of the Migration period. In continental
Europe, this is the rise of Francia in the Merovingian period, eclipsing lesser
kingdoms such as Alemannia. In England, the Wessex hegemony as the nucleus of
the unification of England, Scandinavia is in the Vendel period and enters the
extremely successful Viking Age, with expansion to Britain, Ireland and Iceland
in the west and as far as Russia and Greece in the east. The various Germanic
tribal cultures begin their transformation into the larger nations of later
history, English, Norse and German, and in the case of Burgundy, Lombardy and
Normandy blending into a Romano-Germanic culture. Post-migration ethnogeneses.
The Germanic tribes of the Migration period had settled down by the Early
Middle Ages, the latest series of movements out of Scandinavia taking place
during the Viking Age. The Goths and Vandals were linguistically assimilated to
their Latin (Romance) substrate populations (with the exception of the Crimean
Goths, who preserved their dialect into the 18th century). Burgundians and
Lombards were assimilated into both Latin (French & Italian) and Germanic
(German Swiss) populations. The Viking Age Norsemen split into an Old East
Norse and an Old West Norse group, which further separated into Icelanders,
Faroese and Norwegians on one hand, and Swedes and Danes on the other. In Great
Britain, Germanic people coalesced into the Anglo-Saxon or English people
between the 8th and 10th centuries. On the European continent, the Holy Roman
Empire included all remaining Germanic speaking groups from the 10th century.
In the Late Medieval to Early Modern period, some groups split off the Empire
before a "German" ethnicity had formed, consisting of Low Franconian (Dutch,
Flemish) and Alemannic (Swiss) populations. The various Germanic Peoples of the
Migrations period eventually spread out over a vast expanse stretching from
contemporary European Russia to Iceland and from Norway to North Africa. The
migrants had varying impacts in different regions. In many cases, the newcomers
set themselves up as over-lords of the pre-existing population. Over time, such
groups underwent ethnogenesis, resulting in the creation of new cultural and
ethnic identities (such as the Franks and Galloromans becoming French). Thus
many of the descendants of the ancient Germanic Peoples do not speak Germanic
languages, as they were to a greater or lesser degree assimilated into the
cosmopolitan, literate culture of the Roman world. Even where the descendants
of Germanic Peoples maintained greater continuity with their common ancestors,
significant cultural and linguistic differences arose over time; as is
strikingly illustrated by the different identities of Christianized Saxon
subjects of the Carolingian Empire and pagan Scandinavian Vikings. More
broadly, early Medieval Germanic peoples were often assimilated into the
"walha" substrate cultures of their subject populations. Thus, the Burgundians
of Burgundy, the Vandals of Northern Africa, and the Visigoths of France and
Iberia, lost some Germanic identity and became part of Romano-Germanic Europe.
Likewise, the Franks of Western Francia form part of the ancestry of the French
people. Examples of assimilation during the Viking Age include the Norsemen
settled in Normandy and on the French Atlantic coast, and the societal elite in
medieval Russia among whom many were the descendants of Slavified Norsemen (a
theory, however, contested by some Slavic scholars in the former Soviet Union,
who name it the "Normanist theory)". The Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain
resulted in Anglo-Saxon, or English, displacement of and cultural assimilation
of the indigenous culture, the Brythonic speaking British culture causing the
foundation of a new Kingdom, England. As in what became England, indigenous
Brythonic Celtic culture in some of the south-eastern parts of what became
Scotland (approximately the Lothian and Borders region) and areas of what
became the Northwest of England (the kingdoms of Rheged, Elmet, etc.) succumbed
to Germanic influence c.600â€”800, due to the extension of overlordship and
settlement from the Anglo-Saxon areas to the south. Between c. 1150 and c. 1400
most of the Scottish Lowlands became English culturally and linguistically
through immigration from England, France and Flanders and from the resulting
assimilation of native Gaelic-speaking Scots although Lowland Gaelic was still
spoken in Galloway until the 18th century. The Scots language is the resulting
Germanic language still spoken in parts of Scotland and is very similar to the
speech of the Northumbrians of northern England. Between the 15th and 17th
centuries Scots spread into more of mainland Scotland at the expense of
Scottish Gaelic although Gaelic maintained a strong hold over the Scottish
Highlands, and Scots also began to make some headway into the Northern Isles.
The latter, Orkney and Shetland, though now part of Scotland, were nominally
part of the Kingdom of Norway until the 15th century. A version of the Norse
language was spoken there from the Viking invasions until replaced by Scots in
the 18th and 19th centuries. The territory of modern Germany was divided
between Germanic and Celtic speaking groups in the last centuries BCE. The
parts south of the Germanic Limes came under limited Latin influence in the
early centuries CE, but were swiftly conquered by Germanic groups such as the
Alemanni after the fall of the Western Roman Empire. In Scandinavia, there is a
long history of assimilation of and by the Sami people and Finnic peoples,
namely Finns and Karelians. In today's usage, the term 'Nordic peoples' refers
to the ethnic groups in all of the Nordic countries. Culture. Law. Common
elements of Germanic society can be deduced both from Roman historiography and
comparative evidence from the Early Medieval period. A main element uniting
Germanic societies is kingship, in origin a sacral institution combining the
functions of military leader, high priest, lawmaker and judge. Germanic
monarchy was elective; the king was elected by the free men from among eligible
candidates of a family (OE "cynn") tracing their ancestry to the tribe's divine
or semi-divine founder. In early Germanic society, the free men of property
each ruled their own estate and were subject to the king directly, without any
intermediate hierarchy as in later feudalism. Free men without landed property
could swear fealty to a man of property who as their lord would then be
responsible for their upkeep, including generous feasts and gifts. This system
of sworn retainers was central to early Germanic society, and the loyalty of
the retainer to his lord was taken to replace his family ties. Early Germanic
law reflects a hierarchy of worth within the society of free men, reflected in
the differences in weregild. Among the Anglo-Saxons, a regular free man (a
"ceorl") had a weregild of 200 shillings (i.e. solidi or gold pieces),
classified as a "twyhyndeman" "200-man" for this reason, while a nobleman
commanded a fee of six times that amount ("twelfhyndeman" "1200-man").
Similarly, among the Alamanni the basic weregild for a free man was 200
shillings, and the amount could be doubled or tripled according to the man's
rank. Unfree serfs did not command a weregild, and the recompense paid in the
event of their death was merely for material damage, 15 shillings in the case
of the Alamanni, increased to 40 or 50 if the victim had been a skilled
artisan. The social hierarchy is not only reflected in the weregild due in the
case of the violent or accidental death of a man, but also in differences in
fines for lesser crimes. Thus the fines for insults, injury, burglary or damage
to property differ depending on the rank of the injured party. They do not
usually depend on the rank of the guilty party, although there are some
exceptions associated with royal privilege. Free women did not have a political
station of their own but inherited the rank of their father if unmarried, or
their husband if married. The weregild or recompense due for the killing or
injuring of a woman is notably set at twice that of a man of the same rank in
Alemannic law. All freemen had the right to participate in general assemblies
or "things", where disputes between freemen were addressed according to
customary law. The king was bound to uphold ancestral law, but was at the same
time the source for new laws for cases not addressed in previous tradition.
This aspect was the reason for the creation of the various Germanic law codes
by the kings following their conversion to Christianity: besides recording
inherited tribal law, these codes have the purpose of settling the position of
the church and Christian clergy within society, usually setting the weregilds
of the members of the clerical hierarchy parallel to that of the existing
hierarchy of nobility, with the position of an archbishop mirroring that of the
king. In the case of a suspected crime, the accused could avoid punishment by
presenting a fixed number of free men (their number depending on the severity
of the crime) prepared to swear an oath on his innocence. Failing this, he
could prove his innocence in a trial by combat. Corporal or capital punishment
for free men does not figure in the Germanic law codes, and banishment appears
to be the most severe penalty issued officially. This reflects that Germanic
tribal law did not have the scope of exacting revenge, which was left to the
judgement of the family of the victim, but to settle damages as fairly as
possible once an involved party decided to bring a dispute before the assembly.
Traditional Germanic society was gradually replaced by the system of estates
and feudalism characteristic of the High Middle Ages in both the Holy Roman
Empire and Anglo-Norman England in the 11th to 12th centuries, to some extent
under the influence of Roman law as an indirect result of Christianization, but
also because political structures had grown too large for the flat hierarchy of
a tribal society. The same effect of political centralization took hold in
Scandinavia slightly later, in the 12th to 13th century (Age of the Sturlungs,
Consolidation of Sweden, Civil war era in Norway), by the end of the 14th
century culminating in the giant Kalmar Union. Elements of tribal law, notably
the wager of battle, nevertheless remained in effect throughout the Middle
Ages, in the case of the Holy Roman Empire until the establishment of the
Imperial Chamber Court in the early German Renaissance. In the federalist
organization of Switzerland, where cantonal structures remained comparatively
local, the Germanic thing survived into the 21st century in the form of the
Landsgemeinde, albeit subject to federal law. Warfare. Historical records of
the Germanic tribes in Germania east of the Rhine and west of the Danube do not
begin until quite late in the ancient period, so only the period after 100Â BC
can be examined. What is clear is that the Germanic idea of warfare was quite
different from the pitched battles fought by Rome and Greece. Instead the
Germanic tribes focused on raids. The purpose of these was generally not to
gain territory, but rather to capture resources and secure prestige. These
raids were conducted by irregular troops, often formed along family or village
lines, in groups of 10 to about 1,000. Leaders of unusual personal magnetism
could gather more soldiers for longer periods, but there was no systematic
method of gathering and training men, so the death of a charismatic leader
could mean the destruction of an army. Armies also often consisted of more than
50 percent noncombatants, as displaced people would travel with large groups of
soldiers, the elderly, women, and children. Large bodies of troops, while
figuring prominently in the history books, were the exception rather than the
rule of ancient warfare. Thus a typical Germanic force might consist of 100 men
with the sole goal of raiding a nearby Germanic or foreign village. According
to Roman sources, when the Germanic Tribes did fight pitched battles, the
infantry often adopted wedge formations, each wedge being led by a clan head.
Though often defeated by the Romans, the Germanic tribes were remembered in
Roman records as fierce combatants, whose main downfall was that they failed to
unite successfully into one fighting force, under one command. After the three
Roman legions were ambushed and destroyed by an alliance of Germanic tribes
headed by Arminius at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in 9Â AD, the Roman
Empire made no further concentrated attempts at conquering Germania beyond the
Rhine. Germanic tribes would eventually overwhelm and conquer the ancient
world, giving rise to modern Europe and medieval warfare. For an analysis of
Germanic tactics versus the Roman empire see tactical problems in facing the
Gauls and the Germanic tribes Economy. Germanic settlements were typically
small, rarely containing much more than ten households, often less, and were
usually located at clearings in the wood. Settlements remained of a fairly
constant size throughout the period. The buildings in these villages varied in
form, but normally consisted of farmhouses surrounded by smaller buildings such
as granaries and other storage rooms. The universal building material was
timber. Cattle and humans usually lived together in the same house. Although
the Germans practiced both agriculture and husbandry, the latter was extremely
important both as a source of dairy products and as a basis for wealth and
social status, which was measured by the size of an individual's herd. The diet
consisted mainly of the products of farming and husbandry and was supplied by
hunting to a very modest extent. Barley and wheat were the most common
agricultural products and were used for baking a certain flat type of bread as
well as brewing beer. The fields were tilled with a light-weight wooden ard,
although heavier models also existed in some areas. Common clothing styles are
known from the remarkably well-preserved corpses that have been found in former
marshes on several locations in Denmark, and included woolen garments and
brooches for women and trousers and leather caps for men. Other important
small-scale industries were weaving, the manual production of basic pottery
and, more rarely, the fabrication of iron tools, especially weapons. Julius
Caesar describes the Germans in his "Commentarii De Bello Gallico", though it
is still a matter of debate if he refers to Northern Celtic tribes or clearly
identified German tribes. Germans have neither Druids to preside over sacred
offices, nor do they pay great regard to sacrifices. They rank in the number of
the gods those alone whom they behold, and by whose instrumentality they are
obviously benefited, namely, the sun, fire, and the moon; they have not heard
of the other deities even by report. Their whole life is occupied in hunting
and in the pursuits of the military art; from childhood they devote themselves
to fatigue and hardships. Those who have remained chaste for the longest time,
receive the greatest commendation among their people; they think that by this
the growth is promoted, by this the physical powers are increased and the
sinews are strengthened. And to have had knowledge of a woman before the
twentieth year they reckon among the most disgraceful acts; of which matter
there is no concealment, because they bathe promiscuously in the rivers and use
skins or small cloaks of deer's hides, a large portion of the body being in
consequence naked. Gaius Julius Caesar, "Commentarii De Bello Gallico", VI.
XXâ€“XXI Marriage. The young men marry late and their vigor is thereby
unimpaired. The girls, too, are not hurried into marriage. As old and full-
grown as the men, they match their mates in age and strength, and their
children reproduce the might of their parents. Where Aristotle had set the
prime of life at 37 years for men and 18 for women, the Visigothic Code of law
in the 7th century placed the prime of life at twenty years for both men and
women, after which both presumably married. Thus it can be presumed that most
ancient Germanic women were at least twenty years of age when they married and
were roughly the same age as their husbands. Religion. Prior to the Middle
Ages, Germanic peoples followed what is now referred to as Germanic paganism:
"a system of interlocking and closely interrelated religious worldviews and
practices rather than as one indivisible religion" and as such consisted of
"individual worshippers, family traditions and regional cults within a broadly
consistent framework". It was polytheistic in nature, with some underlying
similarities to other Indo-Germanic traditions. Many of the deities found in
Germanic paganism appeared under similar names across the Germanic peoples,
most notably the god known to the Germans as Wodan or Wotan, to the Anglo-
Saxons as Woden, and to the Norse as Ã“Ã°inn, as well as the god Thor â€“ known
to the Germans as Donar, to the Anglo-Saxons as Ãžunor and to the Norse as
ÃžÃ³rr. While the Germanic peoples were slowly converted to Christianity by
varying means, many elements of the pre-Christian culture and indigenous
beliefs remained firmly in place after the conversion process, particularly in
the more rural and distant regions. The Ostrogoths, Visigoths, and Vandals were
Christianized while they were still outside the bounds of the Empire; however,
they converted to Arianism rather than to orthodox Catholicism, and were soon
regarded as heretics. The one great written remnant of the Gothic language is a
translation of portions of the Bible made by Ulfilas, the missionary who
converted them. The Lombards were not converted until after their entrance into
the Empire, but received Christianity from Arian Germanic groups. The Franks
were converted directly from paganism to Catholicism without an intervening
time as Arians. Several centuries later, Anglo-Saxon and Frankish missionaries
and warriors undertook the conversion of their Saxon neighbours. A key event
was the felling of Thor's Oak near Fritzlar by Boniface, apostle of the
Germans, in 723. Eventually, the conversion was achieved by armed force,
successfully completed by Charlemagne, in a series of campaigns (the Saxon
Wars), that also brought Saxon lands into the Frankish empire. Massacres, such
as the Bloody Verdict of Verden, were a direct result of this policy. In
Scandinavia, Germanic paganism continued to dominate until the 11th century in
the form of Norse paganism, when it was gradually replaced by Christianity.
Genetics. It has been suggested that the movements of Germanic peoples had a
strong influence upon the modern distribution of the male lineage represented
by the Y DNA haplogroup I1 as classed by geneticists which is currently
believed to have arisen approximately 4,000 to 6,000 years ago from a single
male (Most Recent Common Ancestor) in Northern Europe, perhaps modern Denmark.
Traces of this lineage appear in the areas the Germanic tribes were recorded as
having invaded or migrated to. Haplogroup I1 accounts for approximately 40% of
Icelandic males, 40%-50% of Swedish males, approximately 40% of Norwegian
males, and approximately 40% of Danish Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroups.
Haplogroup I peaks in certain areas of Northern Germany at approximately 30%.
Amongst men in Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Denmark, and Germany haplogroup R1b and
haplogroup R1a collectively reach levels of 40% or more in Sweden, 50% or more
in Norway, 55-60% in Iceland and 60-70% in Germany. In the areas of England and
the Netherlands Haplogroup R1b accounts for approximately between 50%-70% of
the Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroups. Germanic antiquity in later
historiography. After the decline of Germanic paganism in the High Middle Ages,
the cultural identity of Europe was built on the idea of Christendom as opposed
to Islam (the "Saracens", and later the "Turks"). The Germanic peoples of Roman
historiography were lumped with the other agents of the "barbarian invasions",
the Alans and the Huns, as opposed to the civilized "Roman" identity of the
Holy Roman Empire. The Renaissance revived interest in pre-Christian Classical
Antiquity and only in a second phase in pre-Christian Northern Europe. Early
modern publications dealing with Old Norse culture appeared in the 16th
century, e.g. "Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus" (Olaus Magnus, 1555) and
the first edition of the 13th century "Gesta Danorum" (Saxo Grammaticus), in
1514. Authors of the German Renaissance such as Johannes Aventinus discovered
the "Germanii" of Tacitus as the "Old Germans", whose virtue and unspoiled
manhood, as it appears in the Roman accounts of noble savagery, they contrast
with the decadence of their own day. The pace of publication increased during
the 17th century with Latin translations of the Edda (notably Peder Resen's
"Edda Islandorum" of 1665). The Viking revival of 18th century Romanticism
finally establishes the fascination with anything "Nordic". The beginning of
Germanic philology proper begins in the early 19th century, with Rasmus Rask's
"Icelandic Lexicon " of 1814, and was in full bloom by the 1830s, with Jacob
Grimm's "Deutsche Mythologie" giving an extensive account of reconstructed
Germanic mythology and his "Deutsches WÃ¶rterbuch" of Germanic etymology. The
development of Germanic studies as an academic discipline in the 19th century
ran parallel to the rise of nationalism in Europe and the search for national
histories for the nascent nation states developing after the end of the
Napoleonic Wars. A "Germanic" national ethnicity offered itself for the
unification of Germany, contrasting the emerging German Empire with its
neighboring rivals, the "Welsche" French Third Republic and the "Slavic"
Russian Empire. The nascent German ethnicity was consequently built on national
myths of Germanic antiquity, in instances such as the Walhalla temple and the
Hermann Heights Monument. These tendencies culminated in Pan-Germanism, the "
aiming for the political unity of all of German-speaking Europe (all
"Volksdeutsche") into a Teutonic nation state. Contemporary Romantic
nationalism in Scandinavia placed more weight on the Viking Age, resulting in
the movement known as Scandinavism. The theories of race developed in the same
period identified the Germanic peoples of the Migration period as members of a
Nordic race expanding at the expense of an Alpine race native to Central and
Eastern Europe.
