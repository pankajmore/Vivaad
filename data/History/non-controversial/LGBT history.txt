LGBT history LGBT history refers to the history of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and
transgender (LGBT) peoples and cultures around the world, dating back to the
first recorded instances of same-sex love and sexuality of ancient
civilizations. What survives of many centuries' persecution‚Äì resulting in
shame, suppression, and secrecy‚Äì has only recently been pursued and
interwoven into historical narrative. In 1994 the first month-long annual
observance LGBT History Month began in the US and has been picked up by other
countries. They cover the history of the people, LGBT rights and related civil
rights movements. It is observed during October in the United States, to
include National Coming Out Day on October 11. In the United Kingdom, it is
observed during February, to coincide with a major celebration of the 2005
abolition of Section 28, which had prohibited schools from discussing LGBT
issues or counseling LGBT or questioning youth. Ancient history. Among
historical figures, some were recorded as having relations with others of their
own sex ‚Äî exclusively or together with opposite-sex relations ‚Äî while
others were recorded as only having relations with the opposite sex. However,
there are instances of same-sex love and sexuality within almost all ancient
civilizations. Additionally, Transgender and third sex peoples have been
recorded in almost all cultures across human history. Classical antiquity in
Europe. The earliest documents concerning same-sex relationships come from
Ancient Greece. Such relationships did not replace marriage between man and
woman, but occurred before and beside it. A mature man would not usually have a
mature male mate (with exceptions such as Alexander the Great and the same-aged
Hephaestion) but the older man would usually be the "erastes" (lover) to a
young "eromenos" (loved one). The ideal held that both partners would be
inspired by love symbolized by Eros, the erastes unselfishly providing
education, guidance, and appropriate gifts to his eromenos, who became his
devoted pupil and assistant, while the sexuality theoretically remained short
of penetrative acts and supposedly would consist primarily of the act of
frottage or intercrural sex. Although this was the ideal, realistically
speaking, it is probable that in many such relationships fellatio and
penetrative anal intercourse did occur. The hoped-for result was the mutual
improvement of both erastes and eromenos, each doing his best to excel in order
to be worthy of the other. If one was open about one's homosexuality then they
were exiled or in some cases executed because it was regarded as a duty to
one's ethnic group to reproduce. Kenneth J. Dover, followed by Michel Foucault
and Halperin, assumed that it was considered improper for the eromenos to feel
desire, as that would not be masculine. However, Dover's claim has been
questioned in light of evidence of love poetry which suggests a more emotional
connection than earlier researchers liked to acknowledge. Some research has
shown that ancient Greeks believed semen, more specifically sperm, to be the
source of knowledge, and that these relationships served to pass wisdom on from
the erastes to the eromenos within society. In Ancient Greece and Phrygia, and
later in the Roman Republic, the Goddess Cybele was worshiped by a cult of
people who castrated themselves, and thereafter took female dress and referred
to themselves as female. These early transsexual figures have also been
referred to as early gay role models by several authors. In Roman patriarchal
society, it was socially acceptable for an adult male citizen to take the
penetrative role in same-sex relations. Freeborn male minors were strictly
protected from sexual predators (see "Lex Scantinia"), and men who willingly
played the "passive" role in homosexual relations were disparaged. No law or
moral censure was directed against homosexual behaviors as such, as long as the
citizen took the dominant role with a partner of lower status such as a slave,
prostitute, or someone considered "infamis", of no social standing. Attitudes
toward homosexual behavior changed when the Empire fell under Christian rule;
see for instance legislation of Justinian I. Ancient China and Japan.
Homosexuality has been acknowledged in China since ancient times. Scholar Pan
Guangdan (ÊΩòÂÖâÊó¶) came to the conclusion that nearly every emperor in the
Han Dynasty had one or more male sex partners. There are also descriptions of
lesbians in some history books. It is believed homosexuality was popular in the
Song, Ming and Qing dynasties. Chinese homosexuals did not experience high-
profile persecution as compared with that which was received by homosexuals in
Europe during the Middle Ages. Same-sex love was celebrated in Chinese art,
many examples of which have survived the book burnings of the Cultural
Revolution. Though no large statues are known to still exist, many hand scrolls
and paintings on silk can be found in private collections. In Japan, several
Heian diaries which contain references to homosexual acts exist as well. Some
of these also contain references to emperors involved in homosexual
relationships and to "handsome boys retained for sexual purposes" by emperors.
In other literary works can be found references to what Leupp has called
"problems of gender identity", such as the story of a youth's falling in love
with a girl who is actually a cross-dressing male. Japanese "shunga" are erotic
pictures which include same-sex and opposite-sex love. South Asia. In South
Asia the "Hijra" are a caste of third-gender, or transgender group who live a
feminine role. Hijra may be born male or intersex, and some may have been born
female. South Pacific. In many societies of Melanesia, especially in Papua New
Guinea, same-sex relationships were, until the middle of the last century, an
integral part of the culture. The Etoro and Marind-anim for example, even
viewed heterosexuality as sinful and celebrated homosexuality instead. In many
traditional Melanesian cultures a pre-pubertal boy would be paired with an
older adolescent who would become his mentor and who would "inseminate" him
(orally, anally, or topically, depending on the tribe) over a number of years
in order for the younger to also reach puberty. Many Melanesian societies,
however, have become hostile towards pederasty and same-sex relationships since
the introduction of Christianity by European missionaries. Middle East. Among
many Middle Eastern Muslim cultures egalitarian or age-structured homosexual
practices were, and remain, widespread and thinly veiled. The prevailing
pattern of same-sex relationships in the temperate and sub-tropical zone
stretching from Northern India to the Western Sahara is one in which the
relationships were‚Äîand are‚Äîeither gender-structured or age-structured or
both. The practice of bacha bazi is one among many forms of pederasty
ubiquitous in the Muslim world. In pre-modern Islam there was a "widespread
conviction that beardless youths possessed a temptation to adult men as a
whole, and not merely to a small minority of deviants." Eminent scholars of
Islam, such as Sheikh ul-Islam Imam Malik, and Imam Shafi amongst others, ruled
that Islam disallowed homosexuality and ordained capital punishment for a
person guilty of it. Homosexual activity is a crime and forbidden in most
Muslim-majority countries. In the Islamic regimes of Iran, Mauritania, Saudi
Arabia, Sudan and Yemen, homosexual activity is punished with the death
penalty. In Nigeria and Somalia the death penalty is issued in some regions.
The legal punishment for sodomy has varied among juristic schools: some
prescribe capital punishment; while other prescribe a milder discretionary
punishment such as imprisonment. In some relatively secular Muslim-majority
countries such as Indonesia, Jordan and Turkey this is not the case. A
tradition of art and literature sprang up constructing Middle Eastern
homosexuality. Muslim‚Äîoften Sufi‚Äîpoets in medieval Arab lands and in Persia
wrote odes to the beautiful wine boys who served them in the taverns. In many
areas the practice survived into modern times, as documented by Richard Francis
Burton, Andr√© Gide, and others. Homoerotic themes were present in poetry and
other literature written by some Muslims from the medieval period onwards and
which celebrated love between men. In fact these were more common than
expressions of attraction to women. Egalitarian relationships modeled on the
western pattern have become more frequent, though they remain rare. Same-sex
intercourse officially carries the death penalty in several Muslim nations:
Saudi Arabia, Iran, Mauritania, northern Nigeria, Sudan, and Yemen. Africa.
Though often ignored or suppressed by European explorers and colonialists,
homosexual expression in native Africa was also present and took a variety of
forms. Anthropologists Stephen Murray and Will Roscoe reported that women in
Lesotho engaged in socially sanctioned "long term, erotic relationships," named
"motsoalle." E. E. Evans-Pritchard also recorded that male Azande warriors (in
the northern Congo) routinely took on boy-wives between the ages of twelve and
twenty, who helped with household tasks and participated in intercrural sex
with their older husbands. The practice had died out by the early 20th century,
after Europeans had gained control of African countries, but was recounted to
Evans-Pritchard by the elders he spoke to. The Middle Ages. Same-sex scholarly
'empires of the mind' were common in medieval Arabic cultures, as seen in their
poetry on same-sex love. According to John Boswell, author of "Christianity,
Social Tolerance and Homosexuality", there were same-sex Christian monastic
communities and other religious orders in which homosexuality thrived.
According to Chauncey et al. (1989), the book "offered a revolutionary
interpretation of the Western tradition, arguing that the Roman Catholic Church
had not condemned gay people throughout its history, but rather, at least until
the twelfth century, had alternately evinced no special concern about
homosexuality or actually celebrated love between men." Boswell was also the
author of "Same-Sex Unions in Pre-Modern Europe" (New York: Villard, 1994) in
which he argues that the "adelphopoiia" liturgy was evidence that attitude of
the Christian church towards homosexuality has changed over time, and that
early Christians did on occasion accept same-sex relationships. Some critics,
notably R. W. Southern, dispute Boswell's findings and scholarly rigor. His
work attracted great controversy, as it was seen by many as merely an attempt
for Boswell to justify his homosexuality and Roman Catholic faith. For
instance, R. W. Southern points out that homosexuality had been condemned
extensively by religious leaders and medieval scholars well before the 12th
century; he also points to the penitentials which were common in early medieval
society, and many of which include homosexuality as among the serious sins.
Bennett and Froide, in "Singlewomen in the European Past", note: "Other single
women found emotional comfort and sexual pleasure with women. The history of
same-sex relations between women in medieval and early modern Europe is
exceedingly difficult to study, but there can be no doubt of its existence.
Church leaders worried about lesbian sex; women expressed, practiced, and were
sometimes imprisoned or even executed for same-sex love; and some women cross-
dressed in order to live with other women as married couples." They go on to
note that even the seemingly modern word "lesbian" has been traced back as far
as 1732, and discuss lesbian subcultures, but add, "Nevertheless, we certainly
should not equate the single state with lesbian practices." While same-sex
relationships among men were highly documented and condemned, "Moral
theologians did not pay much attention to the question of what we would today
call lesbian sex, perhaps because anything that did not involve a phallus did
not fall within the bounds of their understanding of the sexual. Some
legislation against lesbian relations can be adduced for the period, mainly
involving the use of "instruments," in other words, dildoes." Persecutions
against homosexuality rose during the High Middle Ages, reaching their height
during the Medieval Inquisitions, when the sects of Cathars and Waldensians
were accused of fornication and sodomy, alongside accusations of satanism. In
1307, accusations of sodomy and homosexuality were major charges leveled during
the Trial of the Knights Templar. The theologian Thomas Aquinas was influential
in linking condemnations of homosexuality with the idea of natural law, arguing
that "special sins are against nature, as, for instance, those that run counter
to the intercourse of male and female natural to animals, and so are peculiarly
qualified as unnatural vices." The Renaissance. The Renaissance saw intense
oppression of homosexual relationships by the Roman Catholic Church. Homosexual
activity radically passes from being completely legal in the most of Europe to
incurring the death penalty in most European states. In France, first-offending
sodomites lost their testicles, second offenders lost their penis, and third
offenders were burned. Women caught in same-sex acts could be mutilated and
executed as well. Thomas Aquinas argues that sodomy is second only to murder in
the ranking of sins. The church used every means at its disposal to fight what
it considered to be the "corruption of sodomy". Men were fined or jailed; boys
were flogged. The harshest punishments, such as burning at the stake, were
usually reserved for crimes committed against the very young, or by violence.
The Spanish Inquisition begins in 1480, sodomites were stoned, castrated, and
burned. Between 1540 and 1700, more than 1,600 people were prosecuted for
sodomy. In 1532 the Holy Roman Empire made sodomy punishable by death. The
following year King Henry VIII passed the Buggery Act 1533 making all male-male
sexual activity punishable by death. Florentine homosexuality. Florence had a
widespread homosexual culture, which included age-structured relationships. In
1432 the city established "Gli Ufficiali di Notte" (The Officers of the Night)
to root out the practice of sodomy. From that year until 1502, the number of
men charged with sodomy numbered more than 17,000, of whom 3,000 were
convicted. This number also included heterosexual sodomy. This also gave rise
to a number of proverbs illuminating the views of the common people towards the
practice; among them: "If you crave joys, tumble some boys." Association of
homosexuality with foreignness. The reputation of Florence is also reflected in
the fact that the Germans adopted the word "Florenzer" to refer to a
"sodomite". The association of foreignness with homosexuality gradually became
a cornerstone of homophobic rhetoric throughout Europe, and it was used in a
calumnious perspective. For example, the French would call "homosexuality" the
"Italian vice" in the 16th and 17th centuries, the "English vice" in the 18th
century, the "m≈ìurs orientales" (oriental mores) in the 19th century, and the
"German vice" starting from 1870 and into the 20th century. Literature. The
Church could not repress all expressions of homoerotic desire. One of the most
famous examples is a tongue-in-cheek philosophic defense of the practice
provided by Antonio Rocco, in his infamous "L'Alcibiade, fanciullo a scola"
("Alcibiades the Schoolboy", in English) a dialogue in which a teacher seeks to
use philosophy to convince a male student to have sex with him. However, given
the tongue-in-cheek nature of the writing, it seems unclear whether it is meant
to be satire or genuine under the pretense of a joke. Europe. Psychology and
terminology shifts. The developing field of psychology was the first way
homosexuality could be directly addressed aside from Biblical condemnation. In
Europe, homosexuality had been part of case studies since 1790s with Johann
Valentin M√ºller‚Äôs work. The studies of this era tended to be rigorous
examination of ‚Äúcriminals,‚Äù looking to confirm guilt and establish patterns
for future prosecutions. Ambroise Tardieu in France believed he could identify
‚Äúpederasts‚Äù affirming that the sex organs are altered by homosexuality in
his 1857 publishing. Fran√ßois Charles‚Äôs expos√©, Les Deux Prostitutions:
√©tudes du pathologie sociale, (The Two Prostitutions: Study of the Social
Pathology) developed methods for police to persecute through meticulous
documentation of homosexuality. Others include Johann Caspar and Otto Westphal,
Karl Ulrichs. Kraftt-Ebing‚Äôs 1886 publication, Psychopathia Sexualis,was the
most widely translated work of this kind. He and Ulrichs believed that
homosexuality was congenitally based, but Kraft-Ebing differed; in that, he
asserted that homosexuality was a symptom of other psychopathic behavior that
he viewed to be an inherited disposition to degeneracy. Degeneracy became
widely acknowledged theory for homosexuality during the 1870s and 80s. It spoke
to the eugenic and social Darwin theories of the late 19th Century. Benedict
Augustin Morel is considered the father of degeneracy theory. His theories
posit that physical, intellectual, and moral abnormalities come from disease,
urban over-population, malnutrition, alcohol, and other failures of his
contemporary society. An important shift in the terminology of homosexuality
was brought about by the development of psychology‚Äôs inquisition into
homosexuality. ‚ÄúContrary sexual feeling,‚Äù as Westphal‚Äôs phrased, and the
word ‚Äúhomosexual‚Äù itself made their way into the Western lexicons.
Homosexuality had a name aside from the ambiguous term ‚Äúsodomy‚Äù and the
elusive ‚Äúabomination.‚Äù As Michel Foucault phrases, ‚Äúthe sodomite had been
a temporary aberration; the homosexual was now a species.‚Äù An addendum to the
terminology of homosexuality is the seemingly ever-changing acronym, with its
roots in the 1980s when female homosexuals began to identify themselves as
lesbians instead of gay. This led to references of "gay and lesbian" every time
homosexuals were discussed in the media. In the last decade non-heterosexuals
such as bisexuals and those who are trans-gender have been lumped together with
gays and lesbians, resulting in the popular GLBT acronym (gay, lesbian,
bisexual, trans-gender). But since around 2005 the acronym has evolved at times
to LGBT, apparently with the assistance of pro-lesbian lobbying to change the
acronym. But the acronym is not set in stone for all publications, and GLBT or
LGBT seem to appear interchangeably. It has even appeared as GLBTQ (to include
Queer) or even as GLBTQQ (to include both Queer and Questioning). Homosexuality
in eighteenth-century Great Britain. Molly houses appeared in 18th century
London and other large cities. A "Molly house" is an archaic 18th century
English term for a tavern or private room where homosexual and cross-dressing
men could meet each other and possible sexual partners. Patrons of the Molly
house would sometimes enact mock weddings, sometimes with the bride giving
birth. Margaret Clap (?‚Äîcirca 1726), better known as "Mother Clap", ran such
a Molly house from 1724 to 1726 in Holborn, London. She was also heavily
involved in the ensuing legal battles after her premise was raided and shut
down. Molly houses were perhaps the first precursors to the modern gay bar.
Decriminalization of homosexuality in France. In 1791, Revolutionary France
(and Andorra) adopts a new penal code which no longer criminalizes sodomy.
France thus becomes the first West European country to decriminalize homosexual
acts between consenting adults. The emancipation movement in Germany,
1890s‚Äì1934. Prior to the Third Reich, Berlin was a liberal city, with many
gay bars, nightclubs and cabarets. There were even many drag bars where
tourists straight and gay would enjoy female impersonation acts. Hitler decried
cultural degeneration, prostitution and syphilis in his book "Mein Kampf",
blaming at least some of the phenomena on Jews. Berlin also had the most active
LGBT rights movements in the world at the time. Jewish doctor Magnus Hirschfeld
had co-founded the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee (Wissenschaftlich-
humanit√§res Komitee, WhK) in Berlin in 1897 to campaign against the notorious
"Paragraph 175" of the Penal Code that made sex between men illegal. It also
sought social recognition of homosexual and transgender men and women. It was
the first public gay rights organization. The Committee had branches in several
other countries, thereby being the first international GLBT organization,
although on a small scale. In 1919, Hirschfeld had also co-founded the Institut
f√ºr Sexualwissenschaft (Institute for Sex Research), a private sexology
research institute. It had a research library and a large archive, and included
a marriage and sex counseling office. In addition, the institute was a pioneer
worldwide in the call for civil rights and social acceptance for homosexual and
transgender people. Oscar Wilde. Oscar Wilde, the Irish author and playwright
played an important role in bringing homosexuality into the public eye. His
scandal in British Society and subsequent court case from 1885‚Äì6 was highly
discussed not only in Europe, but also in America, although newspapers like the
New York Times concentrated on the question of blackmail, only alluding to the
homosexual aspects as having ‚Äúa curious meaning,‚Äù in the first publication
on April 4, 1895. After Wilde‚Äôs arrest, the April 6 "New York Times"
discussed Wilde‚Äôs case as a question of ‚Äúimmorality‚Äù and did not
specifically address homosexuality, discussing the men ‚Äúsome as young as
18‚Äù that were brought up as witnesses. United States of America. See also
"Bisexual American history." See also "Lesbian American history." See also
"Transgender American history." Pre-contact North America. Prior to western
contact, many American Native tribes had third-gender roles. These include
"berdaches" (a derogatory term for genetic males who assumed a feminine role)
and "passing women" (genetic females who took on a masculine role). The term
"berdache" is not a Native American word; rather it was a European definition
covering a range of third-gender people in different tribes. The proper term
for these individuals is Two-Spirited. Not all Native American tribes had
transgender people. Anthropologists had observed that relatively uncompetitive,
less complex cultures such as those that do not distinguish or reward the best
hunters in distinction to the other men in the tribe have virtually no
homosexuality. One female-born Mohave berdache (known as a "hwame") is known to
have been murdered. Sahaykwisa told other Mohaves that he had been turned into
a man by white man's magic, and took several female lovers. Sahaykwisa was
raped, and later murdered by a group of men. Jackson Katz puts forth that there
is documentation of "intimate relationships between two males, often of a
lifelong character", and "homosexual relations between adults and youths"
(Pederasty) 18th and 19th Century. Before the American Civil War and the
massive population growth of the Post-Civil War America, the majority of the
American population was rural. Without major urban centers to foster sexual
subcultures, no self-conscious homosexual subculture could form. With no access
to alternative opinions to religious, legal, and social castigations, the
culture treatment of homosexuality as a sickness, a sin, and a criminal act
would be internalized by homosexuals‚Äî keeping homosexuality suppressed
personally and culturally. Homosexuality remained unseen and taboo concept in
society. In fact, the word ‚Äúhomosexuality‚Äù was not coined as a word till
1868 by German-Hungarian Karoly Maria Kertbeny (who advocated
decriminalization). During this era, homosexuality fell under the umbrella term
‚Äúsodomy‚Äù that comprised all forms of nonproductive sexuality (masturbation
and oral sex were sometimes excluded). Without urban sub-cultures or even a
name for self-definition, communal solidarity and self-consciousness was
impossible. Mainstream interpretation of , and the destruction of Sodom and
Gomorrah (even though the sins of the city are not detailed well) were the
justification for the severe penalties facing those accused of ‚Äúsodomy.‚Äù
Most of the laws around homosexuality in the colonies were derived from the
English laws of ‚Äúbuggery,‚Äù and the punishment in all American colonies was
death. The penalty for attempted sodomy (both homosexuality and bestiality) was
prison, whipping, banishment, or fines. Thomas Jefferson suggested castration
as the punishment for sodomy, rape, and polygamy in a proposed revision of the
Virginia criminal code near the end of 18th Century. Pennsylvania was the first
state to repeal the death penalty for ‚Äúsodomy‚Äù in 1786 and within a
generation all the other colonies followed suit (except North and South
Carolina that repealed after the Civil War). Along with the removal of the
death penalty during this generation, court case language notably shifted from
Biblical damnation to a more dispassionate language, such as:
‚Äúunmentionable‚Äù or ‚Äúabominable‚Äù acts. This evasive language moved
homosexuality to an absolute taboo in American society, making communal
solidarity ever impossible. Aside from sodomy and ‚Äúattempted sodomy‚Äù court
cases and a few public scandals, homosexuality remained unacknowledged by
mainstream society. Lesbianism had no legal definition largely because of the
Victorian notion of female sexuality was that women were not sexually driven.
In a survey of sodomy law enforcement of the 19th Century, a significant
minority of cases did not even specify gender of the ‚Äúvictim‚Äù and the
accused. Most cases were argued as non-consensual or rape. The first
prosecution for consensual sex between people of the same gender was not until
1880. This can be attributed to the purity movement which also explains the
sharp increase in arrests for prostitution and homosexuality. In response to
the visibility of alternative genders, gender bending, and homosexuality, a
host of laws against vagrancy, public indecency, disorderly conduct, and
indecent exposure were introduced across America as discourse for easier
persecution. ‚ÄúSodomy‚Äù laws also shifted in many states over the beginning
of the 20th Century to specifically address homosexuality (many States during
the 20th Century made anal intercourse between men and women legal). In some
states, these laws would last until the Federal government repealed them in
2004 with the Lawrence decision. The Male Ideal and The 19th Century.
Homosexual identity found its first social foothold in the 19th Century not in
sexuality or homoerotica, but in idealized conception of the wholesome and
loving male friendship during the 19th Century. Or as contemporary author
Theodore Winthrop in Cecil Dreeme writes, ‚Äúa friendship I deemed more
precious than the love of women.‚Äù This ideal came from and was enforced by
the male-centric institutions of boy‚Äôs boarding schools, all-male colleges,
the military, the frontier, etc. ‚Äì fictional and non-fiction accounts of
passionate male friendships became a theme present in American Literature and
social conceptions of masculinity. "Was call'd by my nighest name by clear loud
voices of young men as they saw me / approaching or passing, / Felt their arms
on my neck as I stood, or the negligent leaning of their flesh against me as /
I sat, / Saw many I loved in the street or ferry-boat or public assembly, yet
never told them a / word, / Lived the same life with the rest, the same old
laughing, gnawing, sleeping, / Play'd the part that still looks back on the
actor or actress, / The same old role, the role that is what we make it, as
great as we like, / Or as small as we like, or both great and small." Sometimes
Whitman's writing verged on explicit, such as in his poem, Native Moments‚Äî
‚ÄúI share the midnight orgies of young men / I pick out some low person for my
dearest friend. He shall be lawless, rude, illiterate.‚Äù Poems like these and
Calamus (inspired by Whitman‚Äôs treasured friends and possible lover, Fred
Vaughan who lived with the Whitman family in the 1850s) and the general theme
of manly love, functioned as a pseudonym for homosexuality. The developing sub-
community had a coded voice to draw more homosexuals to New York and other
growing American urban centers. Whitman did, however, in 1890 denounce any
sexuality in the comradeship of his works and historians debate whether he a
practicing homosexual, bisexual, etc. But this denouncement shows that
homosexuality had become a public question by the end of the 19th Century.
Twenty years after Whitman came to New York, Horatio Alger continued the theme
of manly love in his stories of the young Victorian self-made man. He came to
New York fleeing from a public scandal with a young man in Cape Cod that forced
him to leave the ministry, in 1866. Late 19th Century. We'wha was a relatively
modern "Ihamana" (Two-Spirit) of the Native American Zuni tribe. She made a
trip to Washington in 1886, and later shook President Roosevelt's hand. She was
revered by her tribe for her skill at weaving and pottery, as well as taking
part in community ceremonies and rituals. Her life was originally documented by
anthropologist Matilda Coxe Stevenson in the late 19th century. The Early
Twentieth Century. In 1908 the first American defense of homosexuality was
published. "The Intersexes: A History of Similisexualism as a Problem in Social
Life", was written by Edward Stevenson under the pseudonym Xavier Mayne. This
600 page defense detailed Classical examples, but also modern literature and
the homosexual subcultures of urban life. He dedicated the novel to Krafft-
Ebing because he argued homosexuality was inherited and, in Stevenson‚Äôs view
and not necessarily Krafft-Ebing‚Äôs, should not face prejudice. He also wrote
one of the first homosexual novels‚Äî "Imre: A Memorandum". Also in this era,
the earliest known open homosexual in the United States, Claude Hartland, wrote
an account of his sexual history. He affirmed that he wrote it to affront the
naivety surrounding sexuality. It was in response to the ignorance he saw while
being treated by doctors and psychologists that failed to ‚Äúcure‚Äù him.
Hartland wished his attraction to men could be solely ‚Äúspiritual,‚Äù but
could not escape the ‚Äúanimal.‚Äù By this time, society was slowly becoming
aware of the homosexual subculture. In a 1898 lecture in Massachusetts, a
doctor gave a lecture on this development in modern cities. With a population
around three million at the turn of the 20th century, New York‚Äôs queer
subculture had a strong sense of self-definition and began redefining itself on
its own terms. ‚ÄúMiddle class queer,‚Äù ‚Äúfairies,‚Äù were among the
terminology of the underground world of the Lower East Side. But with this
growing public presence, backlash came naturally. The YMCA, who ironically
promoted a similar image to that of the Whitman‚Äôs praise of male brotherhood
and athletic prowess, took a chief place in the purity campaigns of the epoch.
Anthony Comstock, a salesman and leader of YMCA in Connecticut and later head
of his own New York Society for the Suppression of Vice successfully pressed
Congress and many state legislatures to pass strict censorship laws.
Ironically, the YMCA became a site of homosexual conduct. In 1912, a scandal
hit Oregon where more than 50 men, many prominent in the community were
arrested for homosexual activity. In reaction to this scandal conflicting with
public campaigns, YMCA leadership began to look the other way on this conduct.
1920s. Berlin was the leading city for homosexuals during the 1920s with clubs
and even newspapers for both lesbians and gay men. The lesbian magazine Die
Freundin was started by Friedrich Radszuweit and the gay men magazine Der
Eigene had already started in 1896 as the world's first gay magazine. The first
gay demonstration ever took place in Nollendorfplatz in 1922 in Berlin,
gathering 400 homosexuals. The homosexual doctor Magnus Hirschfeld did many
things to improve the situation for gays. Berlin was well known as the decadent
city during the 1920s, which is shown in the musical and movie Cabaret.
Homosexuals received a level of acceptance that was not seen again until the
1960s. Until the early 1930s, gay clubs were openly operated, commonly known as
"pansy clubs". The relative liberalism of the decade is demonstrated by the
fact that the actor William Haines, regularly named in newspapers and magazines
as the number-one male box-office draw, openly lived in a gay relationship with
his lover, Jimmie Shields. Other popular gay actors/actresses of the decade
included Alla Nazimova and Ramon Novarro. In 1927, Mae West wrote a play about
homosexuality called "The Drag", and alluded to the work of Karl Heinrich
Ulrichs. It was a box-office success. West regarded talking about sex as a
basic human rights issue, and was also an early advocate of gay rights. With
the return of conservatism in the 1930s, the public grew intolerant of
homosexuality, and gay actors were forced to choose between retiring or
agreeing to hide their sexuality. Late 1930s. By 1935, the United States had
become conservative once again. Victorian values and mores, which had been
widely ridiculed during the 1920s became fashionable once again. During this
period life was harsh for homosexuals as they were forced to hide their
behavior and identity in order to escape ridicule and even imprisonment. Many
laws were passed against homosexuals during this period and it was declared to
be a mental illness. Many police forces conducted operations to arrest
homosexuals by using young undercover cops to get them to make propositions to
them. WWII and The Holocaust. As the US entered World War II in 1941, women
were provided opportunities to volunteer for their country and almost 250,000
women served in the armed forces, mostly in the Women's Army Corps (WAC), two-
thirds of whom were single and under the age of twenty-five. Women were
recruited with posters showing muscular, short-haired women wearing tight-
fitting tailored uniforms. Many lesbians joined the WAC to meet other women and
to do "men‚Äôs work." Few were rejected for lesbianism, and found that being
strong or having masculine appearance ‚Äì characteristics associated with
homosexual women ‚Äì aided in the work as mechanics and motor vehicle
operators. A popular Fleischmann‚Äôs Yeast advertisement showed a WAC riding a
motorcycle with the heading "This is no time to be frail." Some recruits
appeared at their inductions wearing men‚Äôs clothing and their hair slicked
back in the classic butch style of out lesbians of the time. Post-war many
women including lesbians declined opportunities to return to traditional gender
roles and helped redefine societal expectations that fed the women's, black and
gay liberation movements. The war effort greatly shifted American culture and
by extension representations in entertainment of both the nuclear family and
LGBT people. In mostly same sex quarters service members were more easily able
to express their interests and find willing partners of all sexualities. During
The Holocaust about 50,000 people were sentenced because of their homosexuality
and several thousands of them died in concentration camps. Outside of the gay
community, this persecution of homosexuals is usually ignored (see History of
Gays during the Holocaust for more information). Conditions for gay men in the
camps was especially rough; they faced not only persecution from German
soldiers, but also other prisoners, and many gay men were reported to die of
beatings. German soldiers were also known to use the pink triangles that the
men were forced to wear for target practice with their weapons. Female
homosexuality was not, technically, a crime and thus gay women were generally
not treated as harshly as gay men. Although there are some scattered reports
that gay women were sometimes imprisoned for their sexuality, most would have
been imprisoned for other reasons, i.e. "anti-social". By the 1930s both
"fruit" and "fruitcake" terms as well as numerous other words are seen as not
only negative but also to mean male homosexual, although probably not
universally. LGBT people were widely diagnosed as diseased with the potential
for being cured, thus were regularly "treated" with castration, lobotomies,
pudic nerve surgery, and electroshock treatment. so transferring the meaning of
"fruitcake", nutty, to someone who is deemed insane, or crazy, may have seemed
rational at the time and many apparently believed that LGBT people were
mentally unsound. In the United States, psychiatric institutions ("mental
hospitals") where many of these procedures were carried out were called
"fruitcake factories" while in 1960s Australia they were called "fruit
factories". From 1942 to 1947, WWII conscientious objectors in the US assigned
to psychiatric hospitals under Civilian Public Service exposed abuses
throughout the psychiatric care system and were instrumental in reforms of the
1940s and 1950s. Stonewall Riots. In the autumn of 1959, the police force of
New York City's Wagner administration began closing down the city's gay bars,
which had numbered almost two dozen in Manhattan at the beginning of the year.
This crackdown was largely the result of a sustained campaign by the right-wing
"NY Mirror" newspaper columnist Lee Mortimer. Existing gay bars were quickly
closed and new ones lasted only a short time. The election of John Lindsay in
1965 signaled a major shift in city politics, and a new attitude toward sexual
mores began changing the social atmosphere of New York. On April 21, 1966, Dick
Leitsch, president of the New York Mattachine Society and two other members
staged the Sip-in at Julius bar on West 10th Street in Greenwich Village. This
resulted in the anti-gay accommodation rules of the NY State Liquor Authority
being overturned in subsequent court actions. These SLA provisions declared
that it was illegal for homosexuals to congregate and be served alcoholic
beverages in bars. An example of when these laws had been upheld is in 1940
when Gloria's, a bar that had been closed for such violations, fought the case
in court and lost. Prior to this change in the law, the business of running a
gay bar had to involve paying bribes to the police and Mafia. As soon as the
law was altered, the SLA ceased closing legally licensed gay bars and such bars
could no longer be prosecuted for serving gays and lesbians. Mattachine pressed
this advantage very quickly and Mayor Lindsay was confronted with the issue of
police entrapment in gay bars, resulting in this practice being stopped. On the
heels of this victory, the mayor cooperated in getting questions about
homosexuality removed from NYC hiring practices. The police and fire
departments resisted the new policy, however, and refused to cooperate. The
result of these changes in the law, combined with the open social- and sexual-
attitudes of the late Sixties, led to the increased visibility of gay life in
New York. Several licensed gay bars were in operation in Greenwich Village and
the Upper West Side, as well as illegal, unlicensed places serving alcohol,
such as the Stonewall Inn and the Snakepit, both in Greenwich Village. The
Stonewall riots were a series of violent conflicts between gay men, drag queens
and butch dykes against a police officer raid in New York City. The first night
of rioting began on Friday, June 27, 1969 at about 1:20¬ am, when police raided
the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar operating without a state license in Greenwich
Village. "Stonewall" is considered a turning point for the modern gay rights
movement worldwide. Newspaper coverage of the events was minor in the city,
since, in the Sixties, huge marches and mass rioting had become commonplace and
the Stonewall disturbances were relatively small. It was the commemorative
march one year later, organized by the impetus of Craig Rodwell, owner of the
Oscar Wilde Book Shop, which drew 5,000 marchers up New York City's Sixth
Avenue, that drew nationwide publicity and put the Stonewall events on the
historical map and led to the modern-day pride marches. A new period of
liberalism in the late 1960s began a new era of more social acceptance for
homosexuality which lasted until the late 1970s. In the 1970s, the popularity
of disco music and its culture in many ways made society more accepting of gays
and lesbians. Late in 1979, a new religious revival ushered in the conservatism
that would reign in the United States during the 1980s and made life hard once
again for LGBT people. Decriminalization of Homosexuality (1961‚Äì2003). The
first US state to decriminalize homosexuality was Illinois in 1961. It was not
until 1969 that another state would follow (Connecticut), but the 1970s and 80s
saw the decriminalization throughout the majority of the United States. The 14
states that did not repeal these laws until 2003 were forced to by the landmark
United States Supreme Court case Lawrence v. Texas. 1980s. In the 1980s a new
intolerance and even hatred against them was manifested by society as it became
more conservative, primarily with the help of the Religious Right (Evangelicals
in particular). It is a common belief within the gay community that Ronald
Reagan and George H.W. Bush were vehemently anti-gay, but that is an extreme
exaggeration. Ronald Reagan spoke up for gay equality as early as 1978, when he
came out against Proposition 6, a ballot initiative that would have dismissed
California teachers who ‚Äúadvocated‚Äù homosexuality, even off-campus. As
President, he allocated 5.727 Billion dollars from 1982 until 1989 for AIDS
research. Socially, the Reagans were well known for being tolerant of
homosexual men. Robert G. Kaiser‚Äôs news story in the March 18, 1984,
Washington Post. ‚ÄúThe Reagans are also tolerant about homosexual men,‚Äù
Kaiser wrote. ‚ÄúTheir interior decorator, Ted Graber, who oversaw the
redecoration of the White House, spent a night in the Reagans‚Äô private White
House quarters with his male lover, Archie Case, when they came to Washington
for Nancy Reagan‚Äôs 60th birthday party ‚Äî a fact confirmed for the press by
Mrs. Reagan‚Äôs press secretary.‚Äù Not all conservatives were as tolerant.
Many people called AIDS a "punishment from God" and blamed gay men for their
"loose morals." However by the later part of the decade the general public
started to show more sympathy and even tolerance for gay men as the toll for
AIDS related deaths continued to rise to include heterosexuals as well as
cultural icons such as Rock Hudson and Liberace, who also died from the
condition. Also despite the more conservative period life in general for gays
and lesbians were considerably better in contrast to the pre-Stonewall era.
Canards against LGBT people are still employed and in 2010 several Christian
right organizations are upgraded from "anti-gay" to hate groups by the Southern
Poverty Law Center which historically tracts hate activities due to the groups'
propagation of known falsehoods about lesbians and gays.". Despite this,
homosexuals in a Wall Street Journal survey in 1991 found in comparison with
average Americans that they were three times more likely to be college
graduates, three times more likely to hold professional or managerial
positions, and had average salaries $30,000 higher. Same-sex marriage. In the
late 20th and early 21st centuries, there has been a growing movement in a
number of countries to regard marriage as a right which should be extended to
same-sex couples. Legal recognition of a marital union opens up a wide range of
entitlements, including social security, taxation, inheritance and other
benefits unavailable to couples unmarried in the eyes of the law. Restricting
legal recognition to opposite-sex couples prevents same-sex couples from
gaining access to the legal benefits of marriage. Though certain rights can be
replicated by legal means other than marriage (for example, by drawing-up
contracts), many cannot, such as inheritance, hospital visitation and
immigration. Lack of legal recognition also makes it more difficult for same-
sex couples to adopt children. The first country to legalize same-sex marriages
was the Netherlands (2001), while the first marriages were performed in the
Amsterdam city hall on April 1, 2001. At present, same-sex marriages are legal
nationally in ten countries (see map on the right): the Netherlands (2001),
Belgium (2003), Spain and Canada (2005), South Africa (2006), Norway and Sweden
(2009), and Portugal, Iceland, and Argentina (2010). In Mexico, same-sex
marriage is recognized in all states, but performed only in Mexico City, where
it became effective on March 4, 2010. In the United States as of July 2011, the
states of New York, Vermont, Iowa, Connecticut, New Hampshire, and
Massachusetts are the ones to recognize and offer same-sex marriages, while the
states of New Jersey, California, Nevada, Washington and Oregon, as well as the
District of Columbia offer same-sex partners benefits similar to those of
legally married couples. Seventeen other States have constitutional provisions
that limit marriages to one man and one woman, while 25 states have statutes
containing similar definitions. In the United States, the debate over whether
or not to make same-sex marriages legally binding remains one of the most
polarizing and divisive political debates of the early 21st century, and it is
discussed with great passion all over the world. During 2004, 13 US states
amended their constitutions to define marriage as being only between one man
and one woman. Some people, including many gay rights advocates and some
heterosexual same-sex marriage advocates, view restrictions such as these as
being an example of the tyranny of the majority in action. Student groups.
Since the mid-1970s students at high schools and universities have organized
GBTL groups, often called Gay-Straight Alliances (GSAs) at their respective
schools. The groups form to provide support for GBTL students and to promote
awareness of GBTL issues in the local community. In 1990, a student group named
The Other Ten Percentile (Hebrew: ◊î◊¢◊©◊ô◊®◊ï◊ü ◊î◊ê◊ó◊®) was founded by a
group of teachers and students in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, becoming
the first GBTL organization in Jerusalem. Frequently, such groups have been
banned or prohibited from meeting or receiving the same recogniztion as other
student groups. For example, in September 2006, Touro University California
briefly attempted to ban the school's GSA, the Touro University Gay-Straight
Alliance. After student demonstrations and an outcry of support from the
American Medical Student Association, the Gay and Lesbian Medical Association
and the Vallejo City Council, Touro University retracted its revocation of the
school's GSA. The university went on to reaffirm its commitment to non-
discrimination based on sexual orientation. However, organizing these groups do
not always work. For most places around the world it takes time for them to
become recognized. Schools. Several public schools have opened with a specific
mission to create a "safe" place for LGBT students and allies, including Harvey
Milk High School in New York City, and The Alliance School of Milwaukee. The
Social Justice High School-Pride Campus is proposed for Chicago, and a number
of private schools have also identified as "gay friendly", such as the
Elisabeth Irwin High School in New York City. In 2012, for the first time, two
American school districts celebrated LGBT History Month; the Broward County
school district in Florida signed a resolution in September in support of
lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Americans, and later that year the Los
Angeles school district, America's second-largest, also signed on. Historical
study of homosexuality. 19th century and early 20th century. When Heinrich
Hoessli and K. H. Ulrichs began their pioneering homosexual scholarship in the
late 19th century, they found little in the way of comprehensive historical
data, except for material from ancient Greece and Islam. Some other information
was added by the English scholars Richard Burton and Havelock Ellis. In German
Albert Moll published a volume containing lists of famous homosexuals. By the
end of the century, however, when the Berlin Scientific-Humanitarian Committee
was formed it was realised that a comprehensive bibliographical search must be
undertaken. The results of this inquiry were incorporated into the volumes of
the "Jahrbuch fur sexualle Zwischenstufen" and Magnus_Hirschfeld's "Die
Homoexualitat des Mannes und des Weibes" (1914). The Great Depression and the
rise of Nazism put a stop to most serious homosexual research. 1950s and 1960s.
As part of the growth of the contemporary gay movement in Southern California,
a number of historical articles made their way into such movement periodicals
as "The Ladder", "Mattachine Review", and "One Quarterly". In France "Aracadie"
under the editorship of Marc Daniel published a considerable amount of
historical material. Almost without exception, university scholars were afraid
to touch the subject. As a result much of the work was done by autodidacts
toiling under less than ideal conditions. Since most of this scholarship was
done under movement auspices, it tended to reflect relevant concerns; compiling
a brief of injustices and biographical sketches of exemplary gay men and women
of the past for example. The atmosphere of the 1960s changed things. The sexual
revolution made human sexuality an appropriate object of research. A new
emphasis on social and intellectual history appeared, stemming in large measure
from the group around the French periodical "Annales". Although several useful
syntheses of the world history of homosexuality have appeared, much material,
especially from Islam, China and other non-Western cultures has not yet been
properly studied and published, so that undoubtedly these will be superseded.
