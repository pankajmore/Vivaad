Renaissance music Renaissance music is music written in Europe during the
Renaissance. Consensus among music historiansÂ â€“ with notable dissentÂ â€“
has been to start the era around 1400, with the end of the medieval era, and to
close it around 1600, with the beginning of the Baroque period, therefore
commencing the musical Renaissance about a hundred years after the beginning of
the Renaissance as understood in other disciplines. As in the other arts, the
music of the period was significantly influenced by the developments which
define the Early Modern period: the rise of humanistic thought; the recovery of
the literary and artistic heritage of ancient Greece and Rome; increased
innovation and discovery; the growth of commercial enterprise; the rise of a
bourgeois class; and the Protestant Reformation. From this changing society
emerged a common, unifying musical language, in particular the polyphonic style
of the Franco-Flemish school. The development of printing made distribution of
music possible on a wide scale. Demand for music as entertainment and as an
activity for educated amateurs increased with the emergence of a bourgeois
class. Dissemination of chansons, motets, and masses throughout Europe
coincided with the unification of polyphonic practice into the fluid style
which culminated in the second half of the sixteenth century in the work of
composers such as Palestrina, Lassus, and William Byrd. Relative political
stability and prosperity in the Low Countries, along with a flourishing system
of music education in the area's many churches and cathedrals, allowed the
training of hundreds of singers and composers. These musicians were highly
sought throughout Europe, particularly in Italy, where churches and
aristocratic courts hired them as composers and teachers. By the end of the
16th century, Italy had absorbed the northern influences, with Venice, Rome,
and other cities being centers of musical activity, reversing the situation
from a hundred years earlier. Opera arose at this time in Florence as a
deliberate attempt to resurrect the music of ancient Greece. Music,
increasingly freed from medieval constraints, in range, rhythm, harmony, form,
and notation, became a vehicle for personal expression. Composers found ways to
make music expressive of the texts they were setting. Secular music absorbed
techniques from sacred music, and vice versa. Popular secular forms such as the
chanson and madrigal spread throughout Europe. Courts employed virtuoso
performers, both singers and instrumentalists. Music for the first time became
self-sufficient, existing for its own sake. Many familiar modern instruments,
including the violin, the guitar, and keyboard instruments, were born during
the Renaissance. During the 15th century the sound of full triads became
common, and towards the end of the 16th century the system of church modes
began to break down entirely, giving way to the functional tonality which was
to dominate western art music for the next three centuries. From the
Renaissance era both secular and sacred music survives in quantity, and both
vocal and instrumental. An enormous diversity of musical styles and genres
flourished during the Renaissance, and can be heard on commercial recordings in
the 21st century, including masses, motets, madrigals, chansons, accompanied
songs, instrumental dances, and many others. Numerous early music ensembles
specializing in music of the period give concert tours and make recordings,
using a wide range of interpretive styles. Overview. One of the most pronounced
features of early Renaissance European art music was the increasing reliance on
the interval of the third (in the Middle Ages, thirds had been considered
dissonances). Polyphony became increasingly elaborate throughout the 14th
century, with highly independent voices: the beginning of the 15th century
showed simplification, with the voices often striving for smoothness. This was
possible because of a greatly increased vocal range in musicÂ â€“ in the Middle
Ages, the narrow range made necessary frequent crossing of parts, thus
requiring a greater contrast between them. The modal (as opposed to tonal)
characteristics of Renaissance music began to break down towards the end of the
period with the increased use of root motions of fifths. This later developed
into one of the defining characteristics of tonality. The main characteristics
of Renaissance music are: Polyphony is one of the notable changes that mark the
Renaissance from the Middle Ages musically. Its use encouraged the use of
larger ensembles and demanded sets of instruments that would blend together
across the whole vocal range. Genres. Principal liturgical forms which endured
throughout the entire Renaissance period were masses and motets, with some
other developments towards the end, especially as composers of sacred music
began to adopt secular forms (such as the madrigal) for their own designs.
Common sacred genres were the mass, the motet, the madrigale spirituale, and
the laude. During the period, secular music had an increasing distribution,
with a wide variety of forms, but one must be cautious about assuming an
explosion in variety: since printing made music more widely available, much
more has survived from this era than from the preceding Medieval era, and
probably a rich store of popular music of the late Middle Ages is irretrievably
lost. Secular music included songs for one or many voices, forms such as the
frottola, chanson and madrigal. Secular music was music that was independent of
churches. The main type was the German lied, Italian frottola, the French
chanson, the Italian madrigal, and the Spanish villancico . Secular vocal
genres included the madrigal, the frottola, the caccia, the chanson in several
forms (rondeau, virelai, bergerette, ballade, musique mesurÃ©e), the
canzonetta, the villancico, the villanella, the villotta, and the lute song.
Mixed forms such as the motet-chanson and the secular motet also appeared.
Purely instrumental music included consort music for recorder or viol and other
instruments, and dances for various ensembles. Common genres were the toccata,
the prelude, the ricercar, the canzona, and intabulation ("intavolatura",
"intabulierung"). Instrumental ensembles for dances might play a basse danse
(or "bassedanza"), a pavane, a galliard, an allemande, or a courante. Towards
the end of the period, the early dramatic precursors of opera such as monody,
the madrigal comedy, and the intermedio are seen. Theory and notation.
According to Margaret Bent (1998), "Renaissance notation is under-prescriptive
by our standards; when translated into modern form it acquires a prescriptive
weight that overspecifies and distorts its original openness." Renaissance
compositions were notated only in individual parts; scores were extremely rare,
and barlines were not used. Note values were generally larger than are in use
today; the primary unit of beat was the semibreve, or whole note. As had been
the case since the Ars Nova (see Medieval music), there could be either two or
three of these for each breve (a double-whole note), which may be looked on as
equivalent to the modern "measure," though it was itself a note value and a
measure is not. The situation can be considered this way: it is the same as the
rule by which in modern music a quarter-note may equal either two eighth-notes
or three, which would be written as a "triplet." By the same reckoning, there
could be two or three of the next smallest note, the "minim," (equivalent to
the modern "half note") to each semibreve. These different permutations were
called "perfect/imperfect tempus" at the level of the breveâ€“semibreve
relationship, "perfect/imperfect prolation" at the level of the
semibreveâ€“minim, and existed in all possible combinations with each other.
Three-to-one was called "perfect," and two-to-one "imperfect." Rules existed
also whereby single notes could be halved or doubled in value ("imperfected" or
"altered," respectively) when preceded or followed by other certain notes.
Notes with black noteheads (such as quarter notes) occurred less often. This
development of white mensural notation may be a result of the increased use of
paper (rather than vellum), as the weaker paper was less able to withstand the
scratching required to fill in solid noteheads; notation of previous times,
written on vellum, had been black. Other colors, and later, filled-in notes,
were used routinely as well, mainly to enforce the aforementioned imperfections
or alterations and to call for other temporary rhythmical changes. Accidentals
were not always specified, somewhat as in certain fingering notations
(tablatures) today. However, Renaissance musicians would have been highly
trained in dyadic counterpoint and thus possessed this and other information
necessary to read a score, "what modern notation requires would then have been
perfectly apparent without notation to a singer versed in counterpoint." See
musica ficta. A singer would interpret his or her part by figuring cadential
formulas with other parts in mind, and when singing together musicians would
avoid parallel octaves and fifths or alter their cadential parts in light of
decisions by other musicians (Bent, 1998). It is through contemporary
tablatures for various plucked instruments that we have gained much information
about what accidentals were performed by the original practitioners. For
information on specific theorists, see Johannes Tinctoris, Franchinus
Gaffurius, Heinrich Glarean, Pietro Aron, Nicola Vicentino, TomÃ¡s de Santa
MarÃ­a, Gioseffo Zarlino, Vicente Lusitano, Vincenzo Galilei, Giovanni Artusi,
Johannes Nucius, and Pietro Cerone. Early Renaissance music (1400â€“1467). This
group gradually dropped the late Medieval period's complex devices of isorhythm
and extreme syncopation, resulting in a more limpid and flowing style. What
their music "lost" in rhythmic complexity, however, it gained in rhythmic
vitality, as a "drive to the cadence" became a prominent feature around mid-
century. Middle Renaissance music (1467â€“1534). In the early 1470s, music
started to be printed using a printing press. Music printing had a major effect
on how music spread for not only did a printed piece of music reach a larger
audience than any manuscript ever could, it did it far cheaper as well. Also
during this century, a tradition of famous makers began for many instruments.
These makers were masters of their craft. An example is Neuschel for his
trumpets. Towards the end of the 15th century, polyphonic sacred music (as
exemplified in the masses of Johannes Ockeghem and Jacob Obrecht) had once
again become more complex, in a manner that can perhaps be seen as correlating
to the stunning detail in the painting at the time. Ockeghem, particularly, was
fond of canon, both contrapuntal and mensural. He composed a mass, "Missa
prolationum", in which all the parts are derived canonically from one musical
line. It was in the opening decades of the next century that music felt in a
tactus (think of the modern time signature) of two semibreves-to-a-breve began
to be as common as that with three semibreves-to-a-breve, as had prevailed
prior to that time. In the early 16th century, there is another trend towards
simplification, as can be seen to some degree in the work of Josquin des Prez
and his contemporaries in the Franco-Flemish School, then later in that of G.
P. Palestrina, who was partially reacting to the strictures of the Council of
Trent, which discouraged excessively complex polyphony as inhibiting
understanding the text. Early 16th-century Franco-Flemings moved away from the
complex systems of canonic and other mensural play of Ockeghem's generation,
tending toward points of imitation and duet or trio sections within an overall
texture that grew to five and six voices. They also began, even before the
Tridentine reforms, to insert ever-lengthening passages of homophony, to
underline important text or points of articulation. Palestrina, on the other
hand, came to cultivate a freely flowing style of counterpoint in a thick, rich
texture within which consonance followed dissonance on a nearly beat-by-beat
basis, and suspensions ruled the day (see counterpoint). By now, tactus was
generally two semibreves per breve with three per breve used for special
effects and climactic sections; this was a nearly exact reversal of the
prevailing technique a century before. Late Renaissance music (1534â€“1600). In
Venice, from about 1534 until around 1600, an impressive polychoral style
developed, which gave Europe some of the grandest, most sonorous music composed
up until that time, with multiple choirs of singers, brass and strings in
different spatial locations in the Basilica San Marco di Venezia (see Venetian
School). These multiple revolutions spread over Europe in the next several
decades, beginning in Germany and then moving to Spain, France and England
somewhat later, demarcating the beginning of what we now know as the Baroque
musical era. The Roman School was a group of composers of predominantly church
music in Rome, spanning the late Renaissance and early Baroque eras. Many of
the composers had a direct connection to the Vatican and the papal chapel,
though they worked at several churches; stylistically they are often contrasted
with the Venetian School of composers, a concurrent movement which was much
more progressive. By far the most famous composer of the Roman School is
Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina. While best known as a prolific composer of
masses and motets, he was also an important madrigalist. His ability to bring
together the functional needs of the Catholic Church with the prevailing
musical styles during the Counter-Reformation period gave him his enduring
fame. The brief but intense flowering of the musical madrigal in England,
mostly from 1588 to 1627, along with the composers who produced them, is known
as the English Madrigal School. The English madrigals were a cappella,
predominantly light in style, and generally began as either copies or direct
translations of Italian models. Most were for three to six voices. "Musica
reservata" is either a style or a performance practice in a cappella vocal
music of the latter, mainly in Italy and southern Germany, involving
refinement, exclusivity, and intense emotional expression of sung text. The
cultivation of European music in the Americas began in the 16th century soon
after the arrival of the Spanish, and the conquest of Mexico. Although
fashioned in European style, uniquely Mexican hybrid works based on native
Mexican language and European musical practice, appeared very early. Musical
practices in New Spain continually coincided with European tendencies
throughout the subsequent Baroque and Classical music periods. Among these New
World composers were Hernando Franco, Antonio de Salazar, and Manuel de Zumaya.
In addition, many composers observed a division in their own works between a
"prima pratica" (music in the Renaissance polyphonic style) and a "seconda
pratica" (music in the new style) during the first part of the 17th century.
Masses. The 15th and 16th century masses had two kinds of sources that were
used, monophonic and polyphonic, with two main forms of elaboration, based on
cantus firmus practice or, beginning some time around 1500, the new style of
pervasive imitation. Masses were normally titled by the source from which they
borrowed. Cantus firmus mass uses the same monophonic melody, usually drawn
from chant and usually in the tenor and most often in longer note values than
the other voices. Mannerism. In the late 16th century, as the Renaissance era
closed, an extremely manneristic style developed. In secular music, especially
in the madrigal, there was a trend towards complexity and even extreme
chromaticism (as exemplified in madrigals of Luzzaschi, Marenzio, and
Gesualdo). The term "mannerism" derives from art history. Transition to the
Baroque. Beginning in Florence, there was an attempt to revive the dramatic and
musical forms of Ancient Greece, through the means of monody, a form of
declaimed music over a simple accompaniment; a more extreme contrast with the
preceding polyphonic style would be hard to find; this was also, at least at
the outset, a secular trend. These musicians were known as the Florentine
Camerata. We have already noted some of the musical developments that helped to
usher in the Baroque, but for further explanation of this transition, see
antiphon, concertato, monody, madrigal, and opera, as well as the works given
under "Sources and further reading." For a more thorough discussion of the
transition to the Baroque specifically pertaining to instrument music, see
"Transition from Renaissance to Baroque in instrumental music". Instruments of
the Renaissance. Many instruments originated during the Renaissance; others
were variations of, or improvements upon, instruments that had existed
previously. Some have survived to the present day; others have disappeared,
only to be recreated in order to perform music of the period on authentic
instruments. As in the modern day, instruments may be classified as brass,
strings, percussion, and woodwind. Medieval instruments in Europe had most
commonly been used singly, often self accompanied with a drone, or occasionally
in parts. During the 15th century there was a division of instruments into Haut
(loud, outdoor instruments) and Bas (quieter, more intimate instruments) Only
two groups of instruments could play freely in both types of ensembles: the
Cornett and sackbut and the Tabor and tambourine. Beginning of the 16th
century, instruments were considered to be less important then voices. They
were used for dances and to accompany vocal music. Instrumental music remained
subordinated to vocal music, and much of its repertory was in varying ways
derived from or dependent on, vocal models. Percussion. Some Renaissance
percussion instruments include the triangle, the Jew's harp, the tambourine,
the bells, the rumble-pot, and various kinds of drums. Woodwinds (aerophones).
The woodwind instruments (aerophones) produce sound by means of a vibrating
column of air within the pipe. Holes along the pipe allow the player to control
the length of the column of air, and hence the pitch. There are several ways of
making the air column vibrate, and these ways define the subcategories of
woodwind instruments. A player may blow across a mouth hole, as in a flute;
into a mouthpiece with a single reed, as in a modern-day clarinet or saxophone;
or a double reed, as in an oboe or bassoon. All three of these methods of tone
production can be found in Renaissance instruments. Conclusion. The 16th
century and early 17th century saw the continual improvement of many types of
instruments. Woodwind instrument bores were redesigned to extend their range
and improve their tone quality. Viols and violins were provided with sound
posts to enhance their sound. The compass of keyboard instruments was widened
and new tuning systems were developed. The Renaissance was, as its name
implies, a period of renewal, invention, and rejuvenation of both music and
instruments.
