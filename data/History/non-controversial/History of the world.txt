History of the world The history of the world is the history of humanity from
the earliest times to the present, in all places on Earth, beginning with the
Paleolithic Era. Distinct from the history of Planet Earth (which includes
early geologic history and pre-human biological eras), world history
encompasses the study of written records, from ancient times forward, augmented
with knowledge gained from other sources such as archaeology. Ancient recorded
history begins with the invention of writing. However, the roots of
civilization reach back to the period before writingâ€”humanity's prehistory in
the Paleolithic Era, or "Early Stone Age". Later, during the Neolithic Era, or
New Stone Age, came the Agricultural Revolution (between 8000 and 5000 BCE) in
the Fertile Crescent, where humans first began the systematic husbandry of
plants and animals. Agriculture spread until most humans lived as farmers in
permanent settlements. The relative security and increased productivity
provided by farming allowed these communities to expand into increasingly
larger units in parallel with the evolution of ever more efficient means of
transport. Grain agriculture, with its need to store food between growing
seasons, enabled the division of labor, the rise of a leisured upper class, and
the development of cities and with them civilization. The growing complexity of
human societies necessitated systems of accounting, which led to writing.
Civilizations developed on the banks of lakes and rivers. By 3000 BCE, they had
arisen in the Middle East's Mesopotamia, on the banks of Egypt's River Nile,
and in the Indus River valley. Similar civilizations probably developed along
major rivers in China, but the archaeological evidence for extensive urban
construction is less conclusive. The history of the Old World (Europe in
particular, but also the Near East and North Africa) is commonly divided into
Antiquity, up to 476 CE; the Middle Ages, from the 5th through the 15th
centuries, including the Islamic Golden Age (c.750 CE â€“ c.1258 CE) and the
early European Renaissance; the Early Modern period, from the 15th century to
the late 18th, including the Age of Enlightenment; and the Late Modern period,
from the Industrial Revolution to the present, including Contemporary History.
In Western histories, the postulated "Fall of Rome" in 476 CE is commonly taken
as signaling the end of antiquity and the beginning of the Middle Ages. By
contrast, Eastern Europe saw a transition from the Roman Empire to the
Byzantine Empire, which did not decline until much later. About 1300 the
European Renaissance emerged. In the mid-15th century, Johannes Gutenberg's
invention of modern printing, employing movable type, revolutionized
communication, helping end the Middle Ages and usher in the Scientific
Revolution. By the 18th century, the accumulation of knowledge and technology,
especially in Europe, had reached a critical mass that brought about the
Industrial Revolution. Elsewhere, including the ancient Near East, ancient
China, and ancient India, historical timelines unfolded differently, as
exemplified in China's Four Great Inventions, the Islamic Golden Age, and
Indian mathematics. By the 18th century, however, due to extensive world trade
and colonization, the histories of most world civilizations became closely
intertwined. In the last quarter-millennium, the growth of knowledge,
technology, commerce, and of the potential destructiveness of war has
accelerated, creating the opportunities and perils that currently confront the
human communities that inhabit the planet. Prehistory. Early humans. Genetic
measurements indicate that the ape lineage which would lead to "Homo sapiens"
diverged from the lineage that would lead to chimpanzees (the closest living
relative of modern humans) around five million years ago. It is thought that
the Australopithecine genus, which were likely the first apes to walk upright,
eventually gave rise to genus "Homo". Anatomically modern humans arose in
Africa about 200,000 years ago, and reached behavioral modernity about 50,000
years ago. Modern humans spread rapidly from Africa into the frost-free zones
of Europe and Asia around 60,000 years ago. The rapid expansion of humankind to
North America and Oceania took place at the climax of the most recent Ice Age,
when temperate regions of today were extremely inhospitable. Yet, humans had
colonised nearly all the ice-free parts of the globe by the end of the Ice Age,
some 12,000 years ago. Other hominids such as "Homo erectus" had been using
simple wood and stone tools for millennia, but as time progressed, tools became
far more refined and complex. At some point, humans began using fire for heat
and cooking. They also developed language in the Palaeolithic period and a
conceptual repertoire that included systematic burial of the dead and adornment
of the living. Early artistic expression can be found in the form of cave
paintings and sculptures made from wood and bone. During this period, all
humans lived as hunter-gatherers, and were generally nomadic; this means they
hunted and foraged for food, and moved constantly from place to place. Rise of
civilization. The Neolithic Revolution, beginning about 8,000 BCE, saw the
development of agriculture, which drastically changed the human lifestyle.
Farming permitted far denser populations, which in time organised into states.
Agriculture also created food surpluses that could support people not directly
engaged in food production. The development of agriculture permitted the
creation of the first cities. These were centres of trade, manufacturing and
political power with nearly no agricultural production of their own. Cities
established a symbiosis with their surrounding countrysides, absorbing
agricultural products and providing, in return, manufactured goods and varying
degrees of military control and protection. The development of cities was
synonymous with the rise of civilization. Early civilizations arose first in
lower Mesopotamia (3500 BCE), followed by Egyptian civilization along the Nile
(3300 BCE) and Harappan civilization in the Indus Valley (3300 BCE). These
societies developed a number of unifying characteristics, including a central
government, a complex economy and social structure, sophisticated language and
writing systems, and distinct cultures and religions. Writing was another
pivotal development in human history, as it made the administration of cities
and expression of ideas far easier. As complex civilizations arose, so did
complex religions, and the first of their kind apparently originated during
this period. Inanimate entities such as the Sun, Moon, Earth, sky, and sea were
often deified. Shrines developed, which evolved into temple establishments,
complete with a complex hierarchy of priests and priestesses and other
functionaries. Typical of the Neolithic was a tendency to worship
anthropomorphic deities. Some of the earliest surviving written religious
scriptures are the "Pyramid Texts", produced by the Egyptians, the oldest of
which date to between 2400 and 2300 BCE. Some archaeologists suggest, based on
ongoing excavations of a temple complex at GÃ¶bekli Tepe ("Potbelly Hill") in
southern Turkey, dating from c. 11,500 years ago, that religion predated the
Agricultural Revolution rather than following in its wake, as had generally
been assumed. Antiquity. Cradles of civilization. The Bronze Age is part of the
three-age system (Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age) that for some parts of the
world describes effectively the early history of civilization. During this era
the most fertile areas of the world saw city states and the first civilizations
develop. These were concentrated in fertile river valleys: The Tigris and
Euphrates in Mesopotamia, the Nile in Egypt, the Indus in India, and the
Yangtze and Yellow River in China. Sumer, located in Mesopotamia, is the first
known complex civilization, developing the first city-states in the 4th
millennium BCE. It was in these cities that the earliest known form of writing,
cuneiform script, appeared c. 3000 BCE. Cuneiform writing began as a system of
pictographs. These pictorial representations eventually became simplified and
more abstract. Cuneiform texts were written on clay tablets, on which symbols
were drawn with a blunt reed used as a stylus. Writing made the administration
of a large state far easier. Transport was facilitated by waterwaysâ€”by rivers
and seas. The Mediterranean Sea, at the juncture of three continents, fostered
the projection of military power and the exchange of goods, ideas and
inventions. This era also saw new land technologies, such as horse-based
cavalry and chariots, that allowed armies to move faster. These developments
led to the rise of empires. Such extensive civilizations brought peace and
stability over wider areas. The first empire, controlling a large territory and
many cities, developed in Egypt with the unification of Lower and Upper Egypt
c. 3100 BCE. Over the next millennia, other river valleys would see monarchical
empires rise to power. In the 24th century BCE, the Akkadian Empire arose in
Mesopotamia; and c. 2200 BCE the Xia Dynasty arose in China. Over the following
millennia, civilizations would develop across the world. Trade would
increasingly become a source of power as states with access to important
resources or controlling important trade routes would rise to dominance. In c.
2500 BCE, the Kingdom of Kerma developed in Sudan, south of Egypt. In modern
Turkey the Hittites controlled a large empire and by 1600 BCE, Mycenaean Greece
began to develop. In India this era was the Vedic period, which laid the
foundations of Hinduism and other cultural aspects of early Indian society, and
ended in the 6th century BCE. From around 550 BCE, many independent kingdoms
and republics known as the Mahajanapadas were established across the country.
As complex civilizations arose in the Eastern Hemisphere, most indigenous
societies in the Americas remained relatively simple for some time, fragmented
into diverse regional cultures. During the Formative stage in Mesoamerica,
(about 1500 BCE to 500 CE), more complex and centralized civilizations began to
develop, mostly in what is now Mexico, Central America, and Peru. They include
civilizations such as the Maya, Zapotec, Moche, and Nazca. They developed
agriculture as well, growing maize and other crops unique to the Americas, and
creating a distinct culture and religion. These ancient indigenous societies
would be greatly affected by European contact during the early modern period.
Axial Age. Beginning in the 8th century BCE, the so-called "Axial Age" saw a
set of transformative religious and philosophical ideas develop, mostly
independently, in many different locations. During the 6th century BCE, Chinese
Confucianism, Indian Buddhism and Jainism, and Jewish Monotheism all developed.
(Karl Jaspers' Axial Age theory also includes Persian Zoroastrianism on this
list, but other scholars dispute Jaspers' timeline for Zoroastrianism.) In the
5th century BCE Socrates and Plato made significant advances in the development
of Ancient Greek philosophy. In the east, three schools of thought were to
dominate Chinese thinking until the modern day. These were Taoism, Legalism and
Confucianism. The Confucian tradition, which would attain dominance, looked for
political morality not to the force of law but to the power and example of
tradition. Confucianism would later spread into the Korean peninsula and toward
Japan. In the west, the Greek philosophical tradition, represented by Socrates,
Plato, and Aristotle, was diffused throughout Europe and the Middle East in the
4th century BCE by the conquests of Alexander III of Macedon, more commonly
known as Alexander the Great. Regional empires. The millennium from 500 BCE to
500 CE saw a series of empires of unprecedented size develop. Well-trained
professional armies, unifying ideologies, and advanced bureaucracies created
the possibility for emperors to rule over large domains, whose populations
could attain numbers upwards of tens of millions of subjects. Some areas
experienced slow but steady technological advancements, with important
developments such as the stirrup and moldboard plow arriving every few
centuries. There were, however, in some regions, periods of rapid technological
progress. Most important, perhaps, was the Mediterranean area during the
Hellenistic period, when hundreds of technologies were invented. Such periods
were followed by periods of technological decay, as during the Roman Empire's
decline and fall and the ensuing early medieval period. The great empires
depended on military annexation of territory and on the formation of defended
settlements to become agricultural centres. The relative peace that the empires
brought encouraged international trade, most notably the massive trade routes
in the Mediterranean that had been developed by the time of the Hellenistic
Age, and the Silk Road. The empires faced common problems associated with
maintaining huge armies and supporting a central bureaucracy. These costs fell
most heavily on the peasantry, while land-owning magnates increasingly evaded
centralised control and its costs. Barbarian pressure on the frontiers hastened
internal dissolution. China's Han Empire fell into civil war in 220 CE, while
its Roman counterpart became increasingly decentralized and divided about the
same time. In the west, the Greeks (and later the Romans) established their own
cultures; whose practices, laws, and customs are considered the foundation of
contemporary western civilization. Beginning in the 3rd century BCE, the Romans
began expanding their territory through conquest and colonization. By the reign
of Emperor Augustus (late 1st century BCE), Rome controlled all the lands
surrounding the Mediterranean. By the reign of Emperor Trajan (early 2nd
century CE), Rome controlled much of the land from England to Mesopotamia. In
the 3rd century BCE, most of South Asia was united into the Maurya Empire by
Chandragupta Maurya and flourished under Ashoka the Great. From the 3rd century
CE, the Gupta dynasty oversaw the period referred to as ancient India's Golden
Age. Empires in Southern India included those of the Chalukyas,the
Rashtrakutas, the Hoysalas, the Cholas and the Vijayanagara Empire. Science,
engineering, art, literature, astronomy, and philosophy flourished under the
patronage of these kings. Meanwhile, East Asia saw the rise of the Han Dynasty,
which was comparable in power and influence to the Roman Empire that lay on the
other side of the Silk Road. While the Romans constructed a vast military of
unprecedented power, Han China was developing advanced cartography,
shipbuilding, and navigation. The East invented blast furnaces and were capable
of creating finely tuned copper instruments. As with other empires during the
Classical Period, Han China advanced in strides in areas of government,
education, mathematics, astronomy, and technology, among others. By the 1st
century CE the Aksumite Empire had established itself as a major trading
Empire, dominating its neighbours in South Arabia and Kush and controlling the
Red Sea trade. They minted their own currency and carved enormous monolithic
stelea such as the Obelisk of Axum to mark their Emperors graves. From the 4th
to 6th centuries, northern India was ruled by the Guptas. In southern India,
three prominent Dravidian kingdoms emerged: Cheras, Cholas and Pandyas. The
ensuing stability contributed to heralding in the golden age of Hindu culture
in the 4th and 5th centuries. Successful regional empires were also established
in the Americas starting from around 2000 BCE. In Mesoamerica, vast pre-
Columbian societies were being built, the most notable being the Maya and
Aztecs. As the mother culture of the Olmecs gradually declined, the great Mayan
city-states slowly rose in number and prominence, and Maya culture spread
throughout YucatÃ¡n and surrounding areas. The later empire of the Aztecs was
built on neighboring cultures and was influenced by conquered peoples such as
the Toltecs. In South America, the 14th and 15th centuries saw the rise of the
Inca. The Inca Empire of Tawantinsuyu, with its capital at Cusco, spanned the
entire Andes Mountain Range, making it the most extensive Pre-Columbian
civilization. The Inca were prosperous and advanced, known for an excellent
road system and unrivaled masonry. Declines and falls. The great empires of
Eurasia were all located on temperate coastal plains. From the Central Asian
steppes, horse-based nomads (Mongols, Turks) dominated a large part of the
continent. The development of the stirrup, and the breeding of horses strong
enough to carry a fully armed archer, made the nomads a constant threat to the
more settled civilizations. The gradual break-up of the Roman Empire, spanning
several centuries after the 2nd century CE, coincided with the spread of
Christianity westward from the Middle East. The Western Roman Empire fell under
the domination of Germanic tribes in the 5th century, and these polities
gradually developed into a number of warring states, all associated in one way
or another with the Roman Catholic Church. The remaining part of the Roman
Empire, in the eastern Mediterranean, would henceforth be the Byzantine Empire.
Centuries later, a limited unity would be restored to western Europe through
the establishment of the Holy Roman Empire in 962, comprising a number of
states in what is now Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, Italy, and parts
of France. In China, dynasties would similarly rise and fall. After the fall of
the Eastern Han Dynasty and the demise of the Three Kingdoms, nomadic tribes
from the north began to invade in the 4th century, eventually conquering areas
of Northern China and setting up many small kingdoms. The Sui Dynasty reunified
China in 581, and under the succeeding Tang Dynasty (618â€“907) China entered a
second golden age. The Tang Dynasty also splintered, however, and after half a
century of turmoil the Northern Song Dynasty reunified China in 982. Yet
pressure from nomadic empires to the north became increasingly urgent. North
China was lost to the Jurchens in 1141, and the Mongol Empire conquered all of
China in 1279, as well as almost half of Eurasia's landmass. Middle Ages. The
Middle Ages center on the Eurasian world and are commonly dated from the fall
of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century. While the Western Roman Empire
fragmented into numerous separate kingdoms, the Eastern Roman, or Byzantine,
Empire survived until late in the Middle Ages. The period also corresponds to
the Islamic conquests, subsequent Islamic golden age, and commencement and
expansion of the Arab slave trade, followed by the Mongol invasions in the
Middle East and Central Asia. South Asia saw a series of middle kingdoms of
India, followed by the establishment of Islamic empires in India. The Chinese
Empire experienced the successive Sui, Tang, Liao, Yuan and Ming Dynasties.
Middle Eastern trade routes along the Indian Ocean, and the Silk Road through
the Gobi Desert, provided limited economic and cultural contact between Asian
and European civilizations. While the Middle Ages held sway in Europe,
civilizations in the Americas, such as the Inca, Maya, and Aztec, continued to
flourish, then ended at different times. Islamic growth. Muslims began their
expansion in Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages. They came to conquer
most of the Middle East, North Africa, and parts of Europe. The knowledge and
skills of the ancient Middle East, of Greece and of Persia were learned by
Muslims in the Middle Ages. Muslims added new and important innovations from
outside, such as the manufacture of paper from China and decimal positional
numbering from India. Much of this learning and development can be linked to
geography. Even prior to Islam's presence the city of Mecca had served as a
center of trade in Arabia, and Muhammad was a merchant. With the new tradition
of the "Hajj", the pilgrimage to Mecca, the city became even more a center for
exchanging goods and ideas. The influence held by Muslim merchants over
African-Arabian and Arabian-Asian trade routes was tremendous. As a result,
Islamic civilization grew and expanded on the basis of its merchant economy, in
contrast to the Christians, Indians and Chinese who based their societies on an
agricultural landholding nobility. Merchants brought goods and their faith to
China (resulting in a present-day population of some 37 million Chinese
Muslims, mainly ethnic Turkic Uyghurs, whose territory was annexed to China),
India, southeast Asia, and the kingdoms of western Africa and returned with new
discoveries and inventions. Medieval Europe. Europe during the Early Middle
Ages was characterized by depopulation, deurbanization, and barbarian invasion,
all of which had begun in Late Antiquity. The barbarian invaders formed their
own new kingdoms in the remains of the Western Roman Empire. In the 7th
century, North Africa and the Middle East, once part of the eastern empire,
became part of the Caliphate after conquest by Muhammad's successors. Although
there were substantial changes in society and political structures, the break
was not as extreme as once put forth by historians, with most of the new
kingdoms incorporating as many of the existing Roman institutions as they
could. Christianity expanded in western Europe and monasteries were founded. In
the 7th and 8th centuries the Franks, under the Carolingian dynasty,
established an empire covering much of western Europe; it lasted until the 9th
century, when it succumbed to pressure from new invadersÂ â€“ the Vikings,
Magyars, and Saracens. During the High Middle Ages, which began after 1000, the
population of Europe increased greatly as new technological and agricultural
innovations allowed trade to flourish and crop yields to increase.
ManorialismÂ â€“ the organization of peasants into villages that owed rents and
labor service to noblesÂ â€“ and feudalismÂ â€“ a political structure whereby
knights and lower-status nobles owed military service to their overlords in
return for the right to rents from lands and manorsÂ â€“ were two of the ways
of organizing medieval society that developed during the High Middle Ages.
Kingdoms became more centralized after the decentralizing effects of the
breakup of the Carolingian Empire. The Crusades, which were first preached in
1095, were an attempt by western Christians to regain control of the Holy Land
from the Muslims, and succeeded long enough to establish some Christian states
in the Near East. Intellectual life was marked by scholasticism and the
founding of universities, while the building of Gothic cathedrals was one of
the outstanding artistic achievements of the age. The Late Middle Ages were
marked by a number of difficulties and calamities. Famine, plague and war
decimated the population of western Europe. The Black Death alone killed
approximately a third of the population between 1347 and 1350. It was one of
the deadliest pandemics in human history. Starting in Asia, the disease reached
Mediterranean and western Europe during the late 1340s, and killed tens of
millions of Europeans in six years; between a third and a half of the
population. The Middle Ages witnessed the first sustained urbanization of
northern and western Europe. Many modern European states owe their origins to
events unfolding in the Middle Ages; present European political boundaries are,
in many regards, the result of the military and dynastic achievements during
this tumultuous period. The Middle Ages lasted until the beginning of the Early
Modern Period in the 16th century, marked by the rise of nation-states, the
division of Western Christianity in the Reformation, the rise of humanism in
the Italian Renaissance, and the beginnings of European overseas expansion
which allowed for the Columbian Exchange. Medieval Sub-Saharan Africa. Medieval
Sub-Saharan Africa was home to many different civilizations. The Aksumite
Empire declined in the 7th century as Islam cut it off from its Christian
allies and its people moved further into the Ethiopian highlands for
protection. They eventually gave way to the Zagwe Dynasty who are famed for
their rock cut architecture at Lalibela. The Zagwe would then fall to the
Solomonic Dynasty who claimed descent from the Aksumite emperors and would rule
the country well into the 20th century. In the West African Sahel region, many
Islamic empires rose, such as the Ghana Empire, the Mali Empire, the Songhai
Empire, and the Kanem Empire. They controlled the trans-Saharan trade in gold,
ivory, salt and slaves. South of the Sahel civilisations rose in the coastal
forests where horses and camels could not survive. These include the Yoruba
city of Ife (noted for its naturalistic art) and the Oyo Empire, the Benin
Empire of the Edo people centered in Benin city, the Igbo Kingdom of Nri which
produced advanced bronze art at Igbo Ukwu, and the Akan who are noted for their
intricate architecture. In what is now modern Zimbabwe various kingdoms evolved
from the Kingdom of Mapungubwe in modern South Africa. They flourished through
trade with the Swahili people on the East African coast. They built large
defensive stone structures without mortar such as Great Zimbabwe, capital of
the Kingdom of Zimbabwe, Khami, capital of Kingdom of Butua and Danamombe
(Dhlo-Dhlo), capital of the Rozwi Empire. The Swahili people themselves were
the inhabitants of the East African coast from Kenya to Mozambique who traded
extensively with Asians and Arabs, who introduced them to Islam. They built
many port cities such as Mombasa, Zanzibar, and Kilwa, which were known to
Chinese sailors under Zheng He and Islamic geographers. The Americas. This
period saw the rise of the Mississippian culture in the modern United States c.
800 CE. The Aztec came to dominate much of Mesoamerica in the 14th and 15th
centuries, and the Inca came to dominate the Andes in the 15th century. In
Mesoamerica, the Teotihuacan civilization fell and the Classic Maya collapse
occurred. Southeast Asia. The beginning of the Middle Ages in Southeast Asia
saw the fall of the Kingdom of Funan to the Chenla Kingdom, which was then
replaced by the Khmer Empire. The Khmer's capital city Angkor was the largest
city in the world prior to the industrial age and contained over a thousand
temples, the most famous being Angkor Wat. The Sukhothai and Ayutthaya kingdoms
were major powers of the Thai people who were influenced by the Khmer. The
Pagan Kingdom also rose to prominence in modern Burma. It was during this
period that Islam spread to Indonesia. Modern history. Modern history (the
"modern period," the "modern era," "modern times") is history of the period
following the Middle Ages. "Contemporary history" encompasses historic events
that are immediately relevant to the present (such as World War I and World War
II). It covers human history from c. 1900 up to the present. Early modern
period. "Early modern period" is a term used by historians to refer to the
period in Western Europe and its first colonies that spans the centuries
between the Middle Ages and the Industrial Revolution â€“ roughly 1500 to 1800.
The early modern period is characterized by the rise to importance of science
and by increasingly rapid technological progress, secularized civic politics,
and the nation-state. Capitalist economies began their rise, initially in
northern Italian republics such as Genoa. The early modern period also saw the
rise and dominance of the mercantilist economic theory. As such, the early
modern period represents the decline and eventual disappearance, in much of the
European sphere, of feudalism, serfdom and the power of the Catholic Church.
The period includes the late decades of the Protestant Reformation, the
disastrous Thirty Years' War, the Age of Discovery, the European colonization
of the Americas, and the peak of European witch-hunting. This period saw a
decline in many African civilizations and an advancement in others. Ethiopia
entered the Zemene Mesafint (Age of Princes) in 1769 when the Emperor became a
figurehead and the country was ruled by warlords, though it later recovered
under Emperor Tewodros II. The Swahili Coast declined after coming under
Portuguese and Omani contol. The Songhai Empire fell to the Moroccans in 1591
when they invaded with guns. The kingdom of Zimbabwe gave way to smaller
kingdoms such as Mutapa and Butua. Other civilizations in Africa advanced
during this period; the Oyo Empire went through its golden age, as did the
Benin Empire. The Ashanti Empire rose to power in what is modern day Ghana in
1670. The Kingdom of Kongo also thrived during this period. European
exploration of Africa reached its zenith at this time. Renaissance. Europe's
Renaissance, beginning in the 14th century, consisted of the rediscovery of the
classical world's scientific contributions, and in the economic and social rise
of Europe. But the Renaissance also engendered a culture of inquisitiveness
which ultimately led to Humanism and the Scientific Revolution. Although it saw
social and political upheaval and revolutions in many intellectual pursuits,
the Renaissance is perhaps known best for its artistic developments and the
contributions of such polymaths as Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, who
inspired the term "Renaissance man". European expansion. During this period,
European powers came to dominate most of the world. One theory of why that
happened holds that Europe's geography played an important role in its success.
The Middle East, India and China are all ringed by mountains and oceans but,
once past these outer barriers, are nearly flat. By contrast, the Pyrenees,
Alps, Apennines, Carpathians and other mountain ranges run through Europe, and
the continent is also divided by several seas. This gave Europe some degree of
protection from the peril of Central Asian invaders. Before the era of
firearms, these nomads were militarily superior to the agricultural states on
the periphery of the Eurasian continent and, if they broke out into the plains
of northern India or the valleys of China, were all but unstoppable. These
invasions were often devastating. The Golden Age of Islam was ended by the
Mongol sack of Baghdad in 1258. India and China were subject to periodic
invasions, and Russia spent a couple of centuries under the Mongol-Tatar yoke.
Central and western Europe, logistically more distant from the Central Asian
heartland, proved less vulnerable to these threats. Geography contributed to
important geopolitical differences. For most of their histories, China, India
and the Middle East were each unified under a single dominant power that
expanded until it reached the surrounding mountains and deserts. In 1600 the
Ottoman Empire controlled almost all the Middle East, the Ming Dynasty ruled
China, and the Mughal Empire held sway over India. By contrast, Europe was
almost always divided into a number of warring states. Pan-European empires,
with the notable exception of the Roman Empire, tended to collapse soon after
they arose. Another doubtless important geographic factor in the rise of Europe
was the Mediterranean Sea, which, for millennia, had functioned as a maritime
superhighway fostering the exchange of goods, people, ideas and inventions.
Nearly all the agricultural civilizations have been heavily constrained by
their environments. Productivity remained low, and climatic changes easily
instigated boom-and-bust cycles that brought about civilizations' rise and
fall. By about 1500, however, there was a qualitative change in world history.
Technological advance and the wealth generated by trade gradually brought about
a widening of possibilities. Many have also argued that Europe's institutions
allowed it to expand, that property rights and free-market economics were
stronger than elsewhere due to an ideal of freedom peculiar to Europe. In
recent years, however, scholars such as Kenneth Pomeranz have challenged this
view, although the revisionist approach to world history has been met with
criticism for systematically "downplaying" European achievements. Europe's
maritime expansion unsurprisinglyÂ â€” given the continent's geographyÂ â€” was
largely the work of its Atlantic states: Portugal, Spain, England, France, and
the Netherlands. Initially the Portuguese and Spanish Empires were the
predominant conquerors and source of influence, and their union resulted in the
Iberian Union, the first global empire, on which the "sun never set". Soon the
more northern English, French and Dutch began to dominate the Atlantic. In a
series of wars fought in the 17th and 18th centuries, culminating with the
Napoleonic Wars, Britain emerged as the new world power. This era in European
culture saw the Age of Enlightenment which led to the Scientific Revolution.
Modern period. The Scientific Revolution changed humanity's understanding of
the world and led to the Industrial Revolution, a major transformation of the
world's economies. The Scientific Revolution in the 17th century had made
little immediate impact on industrial technology; only in the second half of
the 18th century did scientific advances begin to be applied significantly to
practical invention. The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain and used
new modes of productionÂ â€” the factory, mass production, and
mechanisationÂ â€” to manufacture a wide array of goods faster and using less
labour than previously. The Age of Enlightenment also led to the beginnings of
modern democracy in the late-18th century American and French Revolutions.
Democracy and republicanism would grow to have a profound effect on world
events and on quality of life. After Europeans had achieved influence and
control over the Americas, the imperial activities of the West turned to the
lands of the East and Asia. In the 19th century the European states had social
and technological advantage over Eastern lands. Britain gained control of the
Indian subcontinent, Egypt and the Malay Peninsula; the French took Indochina;
while the Dutch cemented their control over the Dutch East Indies. The British
also colonized Australia, New Zealand and South Africa with large numbers of
British colonists emigrating to these colonies. Russia colonised large pre-
agricultural areas of Siberia. In the late 19th century, the European powers
divided the remaining areas of Africa. Within Europe, economic and military
challenges created a system of nation states, and ethno-linguistic groupings
began to identify themselves as distinctive nations with aspirations for
cultural and political autonomy. This nationalism would become important to
peoples across the world in the 20th century. During the Industrial Revolution,
the world economy became reliant on coal as a fuel, as new methods of
transport, such as railways and steamships, effectively shrank the world.
Meanwhile, industrial pollution and environmental damage, present since the
discovery of fire and the beginning of civilization, accelerated drastically.
The advantages that Europe had developed by the mid-18th century were two: an
entrepreneurial culture, and the wealth generated by the Atlantic trade
(including the African slave trade). By the late 16th century, silver from the
Americas accounted for the Spanish empire's wealth. The profits of the slave
trade and of West Indian plantations amounted to 5% of the British economy at
the time of the Industrial Revolution. While some historians conclude that, in
1750, labour productivity in the most developed regions of China was still on a
par with that of Europe's Atlantic economy (see the NBER Publications by Carol
H. Shiue and Wolfgang Keller), other historians like Angus Maddison hold that
the per-capita productivity of western Europe had by the late Middle Ages
surpassed that of all other regions. Contemporary history. 1900-45. The 20th
century opened with Europe at an apex of wealth and power, and with much of the
world under its direct colonial control or its indirect domination. Much of the
rest of the world was influenced by heavily Europeanized nations: the United
States and Japan. As the century unfolded, however, the global system dominated
by rival powers was subjected to severe strains, and ultimately yielded to a
more fluid structure of independent nations organized on Western models. This
transformation was catalysed by wars of unparalleled scope and devastation.
World War I destroyed many of Europe's empires and monarchies, and weakened
Britain and France. In its aftermath, powerful ideologies arose. The Russian
Revolution of 1917 created the first communist state, while the 1920s and 1930s
saw militaristic fascist dictatorships gain control in Italy, Germany, Spain
and elsewhere. Ongoing national rivalries, exacerbated by the economic turmoil
of the Great Depression, helped precipitate World War II. The militaristic
dictatorships of Europe and Japan pursued an ultimately doomed course of
imperialist expansionism. Their defeat opened the way for the advance of
communism into Central Europe, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Romania, Albania, China,
North Vietnam and North Korea. 1945-2000. After World War II ended in 1945, the
United Nations was founded in the hope of allaying conflicts among nations and
preventing future wars. The war had, however, left two nations, the United
States Each was suspicious of the other and feared a global spread of the
other's political-economic model. This led to the Cold War, a forty-year stand-
off between the United States, the Soviet Union, and their respective allies.
With the development of nuclear weapons and the subsequent arms race, all of
humanity were put at risk of nuclear war between the two superpowers. Such war
being viewed as impractical, proxy wars were instead waged, at the expense of
non-nuclear-armed Third World countries. The Cold War lasted to the 1990s, when
the Soviet Union's communist system began to collapse, unable to compete
economically with the United States and western Europe; the Soviets' Central
European "satellites" reasserted their national sovereignty, and in 1991 the
Soviet Union itself disintegrated. The United States for the time being was
left as the "sole remaining superpower". In the early postwar decades, the
African and Asian colonies of the Belgian, British, Dutch, French and other
west European empires won their formal independence. These nations faced
challenges in the form of neocolonialism, poverty, illiteracy and endemic
tropical diseases. Many Western and Central European nations gradually formed a
political and economic community, the European Union, which expanded eastward
to include former Soviet satellites. The 20th century saw exponential progress
in science and technology, and increased life expectancy and standard of living
for much of humanity. As the developed world shifted from a coal-based to a
petroleum-based economy, new transport technologies, along with the dawn of the
Information Age, led to increased globalization. Space exploration reached
throughout the solar system. The structure of DNA, the template of life, was
discovered, and the human genome was sequenced, a major milestone in the
understanding of human biology and the treatment of disease. Global literacy
rates continued to rise, and the percentage of the world's labor pool needed to
produce humankind's food supply continued to drop. The technologies of sound
recordings, motion pictures, and radio and television broadcasting produced a
focus on popular culture and entertainment. Television spots sold both
commercial products and political candidates. Then, in the last decade of this
century, a rapid increase took place in the use of personal computers. A global
communication network emerged in the Internet. One-way mass media gave way to
individual communication in what has been called a shift from the fourth to a
fifth civilization. The century saw the development of man-made global threats,
including nuclear proliferation, global climate change, massive deforestation,
overpopulation, and the dwindling of global resources (particularly fossil
fuels). 21st century. The 21st century has been marked by economic
globalization, with consequent risk to interlinked economies, and by the
expansion of communications with mobile phones and the Internet. Worldwide
demand and competition for resources has risen due to growing populations and
industrialization, mainly in India, China and Brazil. This demand is causing
increased levels of environmental degradation and a growing threat of global
warming. That in turn has spurred the development of alternate or renewable
sources of energy (notably solar energy and wind energy), proposals for cleaner
fossil fuel technologies, and consideration of expanded use of nuclear energy
(somewhat dampened by nuclear plant accidents).
