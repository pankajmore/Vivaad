Modern history Modern history, or the modern era, describes the historical
timeline after the Middle Ages. Modern history can be further broken down into
the "early modern period" and the "late modern period" after the French
Revolution and the Industrial Revolution. "Contemporary history" describes the
span of historic events that are immediately relevant to the present time. The
modern era began approximately in the 16th century. Many major events caused
Europe to change around the turn of the 15th to 16th century, starting with the
Fall of Constantinople in 1453, the fall of Muslim Spain and the discovery of
the Americas in 1492, and Martin Luther's Protestant Reformation in 1517. In
England the modern period is often dated to the start of the Tudor period with
the victory of Henry VII over Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485.
Early modern European history is usually seen to span from the turn of the 14th
to 15th century, through the Age of Reason and the Age of Enlightenment in the
17th and 18th centuries, until the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in
the late 18th century. The study of modern history. Some events, though born
out of context not entirely new, show a new way of perceiving the world. The
concept of modernity interprets the general meaning of these events and seeks
explanations for major developments. Source text. The fundamental difficulty of
studying modern history is the fact that a plethora of it has been documented
up to the present day. It is imperative to consider the reliability of the
information obtained from these records. Terminology and usage. Pre-Modern. In
the Pre-Modern era, many people's sense of self and purpose was often expressed
via a faith in some form of deity, be that in a single god or in many gods.
Pre-modern cultures have not been thought of creating a sense of distinct
individuality, though. Religious officials, who often held positions of power,
were the spiritual intermediaries to the common person. It was only through
these intermediaries that the general masses had access to the divine.
Tradition was sacred to ancient cultures and was unchanging and the social
order of ceremony and morals in a culture could be strictly enforced. Modern.
In contrast to the pre-modern era, Western civilization made a gradual
transition from "premodernity" to modernity when scientific methods were
developed which led many to believe that the use of science would lead to all
knowledge, thus throwing back the shroud of myth under which pre-modern peoples
lived. New information about the world was discovered via empirical
observation, versus the historic use of reason and innate knowledge. The term
"modern" was coined shortly before 1585 to describe the beginning of a new era.
The European Renaissance (about 1420‚Äì1630) is an important transition period
beginning between the Late Middle Ages and Early Modern Times, which started in
Italy. The term "Early Modern" was introduced in the English language in the
1930s. to distinguish the time between what we call Middle Ages and time of the
late Enlightenment (1800) (when the meaning of the term Modern Ages was
developing its contemporary form). It is important to note that these terms
stem from European History. In usage in other parts of the world, such as in
Asia, and in Muslim countries, the terms are applied in a very different way,
but often in the context with their contact with European culture in the Age of
Discoveries. Postmodern and contemporary. "Postmodernism", coined 1949, on the
other hand, would describe rather a movement in art than a period of history,
and is usually applied to arts, but not to any events of the very recent
history. This changed when postmodernity was coined to describe the major
changes in the 1950s and 1960s in economy, society, culture, and philosophy.
Sometimes distinct from the modern periods themselves, the terms "modernity"
and "modernism" refer to a new way of thinking, distinct from medieval
thinking. ""Contemporary"" is applied to more recent events because it means
"belonging to the same period" and "current". Modern era. Significant
developments. The modern period has been a period of significant development in
the fields of science, politics, warfare, and technology. It has also been an
age of discovery and globalization. During this time, the European powers and
later their colonies, began a political, economic, and cultural colonization of
the rest of the world. By the late 19th and 20th centuries, modernist art,
politics, science and culture has come to dominate not only Western Europe and
North America, but almost every civilized area on the globe, including
movements thought of as opposed to the west and globalization. The modern era
is closely associated with the development of individualism, capitalism,
urbanization and a belief in the possibilities of technological and political
progress. The brutal wars and other problems of this era, many of which come
from the effects of rapid change, and the connected loss of strength of
traditional religious and ethical norms, have led to many reactions against
modern development. Optimism and belief in constant progress has been most
recently criticized by postmodernism while the dominance of Western Europe and
Anglo-America over other continents has been criticized by postcolonial theory.
Modern as post-medieval. One common use of the term is to describe the
condition of Western history since the mid-15th century, or roughly the
European development of movable type and the printing press. In this context
the "modern" society is said to develop over many periods, and to be influenced
by important events which represent breaks in the continuity. Early modern
period. As an Age of Revolutions dawned, beginning with those revolts in
America and France, political changes were then pushed forward in other
countries partly as a result of upheavals of the Napoleonic Wars and their
impact on thought and thinking, from concepts from nationalism to organizing
armies. The early period ended in a time of political and economic change as a
result of mechanization in society, the American Revolution, the first French
Revolution; other factors included the redrawing of the map of Europe by the of
the Congress of Vienna and the peace established by Second Treaty of Paris
which ended the Napoleonic Wars. Late modern period. Our most recent eraModern
Timesbegins with the end of these revolutions in the 19th century, and includes
the World Wars era (encompassing World War I and World War II) and the
emergence of socialist countries that lead to the Cold War. The "contemporary
era" follows shortly afterward with the explosion of research and increase of
knowledge known as the Information Age in the latter 20th and the early 21st
century. Today's Postmodern era is seen in widespread Digitality. Early modern
period. The early modern period is a term used by historians to refer to the
period from approximately 1500 to 1800. follows the Late Middle Ages period,
and is marked by the first European colonies, the rise of strong centralized
governments, and the beginnings of recognizable nation states that are the
direct antecedents of today's states. In Africa and the Ottoman Empire, the
Muslim expansion took place in North and East Africa. In West Africa, various
native nations existed. The Indian Empires and civilizations of Southeast Asia
were a vital link in the spice trade. On the Indian subcontinent, the Great
Mughal Empire existed. The archipelagic empires, the Sultanate of Malacca and
later the Sultanate of Johor, controlled the southern areas. Concerning the
Asia, various Chinese dynasties and Japanese shogunates controlled the Asian
sphere. In Japan, the Edo period from 1600 to 1868 is also sometimes referred
to as the early modern period. And in Korea, from the rising of Joseon Dynasty
to the enthronement of King Gojong is referred to as the early modern period.
In the Americas, Native Americans had built a large and varied civilization,
including the Aztec Empire and alliance, the Inca civilization, the Mayan
Empire and cities, and the Chibcha Confederation. In the west, the European
kingdoms and movements were in a movement of reformation and expansion. Russia
reached the Pacific coast in 1647 and consolidated its control over the Russian
Far East in the 19th century. Later religious trends of the period saw the end
of the expansion of Muslims and the Muslim world. Christians and Christendom
saw the end of the Crusades and end of religious unity under the Roman Catholic
Church. It was during this time that the Inquisitions and Protestant
reformations took place. During the early modern period, an age of discovery
and trade was undertaken by the European nations. European powers went on a
colonial expansion and took possession throughout the world. There was a
conquest of the Americas and exploitation of its resources. Various European
powers set up colonies in North America and Latin America. Toward the end of
the early period, Europe was dominated by the evolving system of mercantile
capitalism in its trade and the New Economy. European states and politics had
the characteristic of Absolutism. The French power and English revolutions
dominated the political scene. There eventually evolved an international
balance of power that held sway a great conflagration until years later. The
end date of the early modern period is usually associated with the Industrial
Revolution, which began in Britain in about 1750. Another significant date is
1789, the beginning of the French Revolution, which drastically transformed the
state of European politics and ushered in the Prince Edward Era and modern
Europe. Eastern foundations. In China, urbanization increased as the population
grew and as the division of labor grew more complex. Large urban centers, such
as Nanjing and Beijing, also contributed to the growth of private industry. In
particular, small-scale industries grew up, often specializing in paper, silk,
cotton, and porcelain goods. For the most part, however, relatively small urban
centers with markets proliferated around the country. Town markets mainly
traded food, with some necessary manufactures such as pins or oil. Despite the
xenophobia and intellectual introspection characteristic of the increasingly
popular new school of neo-Confucianism, China under the early Ming Dynasty was
not isolated. Foreign trade and other contacts with the outside world,
particularly Japan, increased considerably. Chinese merchants explored all of
the Indian Ocean, reaching East Africa with the voyages of Zheng He. The Qing
Dynasty (1644‚Äì1911) was founded after the defeat of the Ming, the last Han
Chinese dynasty, by the Manchus. The Manchus were formerly known as the
"Jurchen". When Beijing was captured by Li Zicheng's peasant rebels in 1644,
the last Ming Emperor Chongzhen committed suicide. The Manchu then allied with
Ming Dynasty general Wu Sangui and seized control of Beijing, which became the
new capital of the Qing dynasty. The Manchus adopted the Confucian norms of
traditional Chinese government in their rule of China proper. In Japan
following the Sengoku Period of "warring states", central government had been
largely reestablished by Oda Nobunaga and Toyotomi Hideyoshi during the Azuchi-
Momoyama period. After the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, central authority fell
to Tokugawa Ieyasu who completed this process and received the title of
"shogun" in 1603. In order to become shogun, one traditionally was a descendant
of the ancient Minamoto clan. Society in the Japanese "Tokugawa period", unlike
the shogunates before it, was supposedly based on the strict class hierarchy
originally established by Toyotomi Hideyoshi. The daimyo, or lords, were at the
top, followed by the warrior-caste of samurai, with the farmers, artisans, and
traders ranking below. In some parts of the country, particularly smaller
regions, "daimyo" and "samurai" were more or less identical, since "daimyo"
might be trained as "samurai", and "samurai" might act as local lords.
Otherwise, the largely inflexible nature of this social stratification system
unleashed disruptive forces over time. Taxes on the peasantry were set at fixed
amounts which did not account for inflation or other changes in monetary value.
As a result, the tax revenues collected by the samurai landowners were worth
less and less over time. This often led to numerous confrontations between
noble but impoverished samurai and well-to-do peasants, ranging from simple
local disturbances to much bigger rebellions. None, however, proved compelling
enough to seriously challenge the established order until the arrival of
foreign powers. On the Indian subcontinent, the Mughal Empire ruled most of
India in the early 18th century. The "classic period" ended with the death and
defeat of Emperor Aurangzeb in 1707 by the rising Hindu Maratha Empire,
although the dynasty continued for another 150 years. During this period, the
Empire was marked by a highly centralized administration connecting the
different regions. All the significant monuments of the Mughals, their most
visible legacy, date to this period which was characterised by the expansion of
Persian cultural influence in the Indian subcontinent, with brilliant literary,
artistic, and architectural results. The Maratha Empire was located in the
south west of present-day India and expanded greatly under the rule of the
Peshwas, the prime ministers of the Maratha empire. In 1761, the Maratha army
lost the Third Battle of Panipat which halted imperial expansion and the empire
was then divided into a confederacy of Maratha states. Western transformations.
Tsardom of Russia. Russia experienced territorial growth through the 17th
century, which was the age of Cossacks. Cossacks were warriors organized into
military communities, resembling pirates and pioneers of the New World. In
1648, the peasants of Ukraine joined the Zaporozhian Cossacks in rebellion
against Poland-Lithuania during the Khmelnytsky Uprising, because of the social
and religious oppression they suffered under Polish rule. In 1654 the Ukrainian
leader, Bohdan Khmelnytsky, offered to place Ukraine under the protection of
the Russian Tsar, Aleksey I. Aleksey's acceptance of this offer led to another
Russo-Polish War (1654‚Äì1667). Finally, Ukraine was split along the river
Dnieper, leaving the western part (or Right-bank Ukraine) under Polish rule and
eastern part (Left-bank Ukraine and Kiev) under Russian. Later, in 1670‚Äì71
the Don Cossacks led by Stenka Razin initiated a major uprising in the Volga
region, but the Tsar's troops were successful in defeating the rebels. In the
east, the rapid Russian exploration and colonisation of the huge territories of
Siberia was led mostly by Cossacks hunting for valuable furs and ivory. Russian
explorers pushed eastward primarily along the Siberian river routes, and by the
mid-17th century there were Russian settlements in the Eastern Siberia, on the
Chukchi Peninsula, along the Amur River, and on the Pacific coast. In 1648 the
Bering Strait between Asia and North America was passed for the first time by
Fedot Popov and Semyon Dezhnyov. Reason and Enlightenment. Traditionally, the
European intellectual transformation of and after the Renaissance bridged the
Middle Ages and the Modern era. The Age of Reason in the Western world is
generally regarded as being the start of modern philosophy, and a departure
from the medieval approach, especially Scholasticism. Early 17th century
philosophy is often called the Age of Rationalism and is considered to succeed
Renaissance philosophy and precede the Age of Enlightenment, but some consider
it as the earliest part of the Enlightenment era in philosophy, extending that
era to two centuries. The 18th century saw the beginning of secularization in
Europe, rising to notability in the wake of the French Revolution. The Age of
Enlightenment is a term used to describe a time in Western philosophy and
cultural life centered upon the 18th century, in which reason was advocated as
the primary source and legitimacy for authority. Developing more or less
simultaneously in many parts of Europe and America. Developing during the
Enlightenment era, Renaissance humanism was an intellectual movement spread
across Europe. The basic training of the humanist was to speak well and write
(typically, in the form of a letter). The term "umanista" comes from the latter
part of the 15th century. The people were associated with the "studia
humanitatis", a novel curriculum that was competing with the "quadrivium" and
scholastic logic. Renaissance humanism took a close study of the Latin and
Greek classical texts, and was antagonistic to the values of scholasticism with
its emphasis on the accumulated commentaries; and humanists were involved in
the sciences, philosophies, arts and poetry of classical antiquity. They self-
consciously imitated classical Latin and deprecated the use of medieval Latin.
By analogy with the perceived decline of Latin, they applied the principle of
"ad fontes", or back to the sources, across broad areas of learning. The
quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns was a literary and artistic quarrel
that heated up in the early 1690s and shook the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise. It
opposed two sides, the Ancients ("Anciens") who constrain choice of subjects to
those drawn from the literature of Antiquity and the Moderns ("Modernes"), who
supported the merits of the authors of the century of Louis XIV. Fontenelle
quickly followed with his "Digression sur les anciens et les modernes" (1688),
in which he took the Modern side, pressing the argument that modern scholarship
allowed modern man to surpass the ancients in knowledge. Scientific Revolution.
The Scientific Revolution was a period when European ideas in classical
physics, astronomy, biology, human anatomy, chemistry, and other classical
sciences were rejected and led to doctrines supplanting those that had
prevailed from Ancient Greece to the Middle Ages which would lead to a
transition to modern science. This period saw a fundamental transformation in
scientific ideas across physics, astronomy, and biology, in institutions
supporting scientific investigation, and in the more widely held picture of the
universe. Individuals started to question all manners of things and it was this
questioning that led to the Scientific Revolution, which in turn formed the
foundations of contemporary sciences and the establishment of several modern
scientific fields. American wars and revolution. The French and Indian Wars
were a series of conflicts in North America that represented the actions there
that accompanied the European dynastic wars. In Quebec, the wars are generally
referred to as the Intercolonial Wars. While some conflicts involved Spanish
and Dutch forces, all pitted Great Britain, its colonies and American Indian
allies on one side and France, its colonies and Indian allies on the other. The
expanding French and British colonies were contending for control of the
western, or interior, territories. Whenever the European countries went to war,
there were actions within and by these colonies although the dates of the
conflict did not necessarily exactly coincide with those of the larger
conflicts. Beginning in the Age of Revolution, the American Revolution and the
ensuing political upheaval during the last half of the 18th century saw the
Thirteen Colonies of North America overthrow the governance of the Parliament
of Great Britain, and then reject the British monarchy itself to become the
sovereign United States of America. In this period the colonies first rejected
the authority of the Parliament to govern them without representation, and
formed self-governing independent states. The Second Continental Congress then
joined together against the British to defend that self-governance in the armed
conflict from 1775 to 1783 known as the American Revolutionary War (also called
American War of Independence). The American Revolution begun with fighting at
Lexington and Concord. On July 4, 1776, they issued the Declaration of
Independence, which proclaimed their independence from Great Britain and their
formation of a cooperative union. In June 1776, Benjamin Franklin was appointed
a member of the Committee of Five that drafted the Declaration of Independence.
Although he was temporarily disabled by gout and unable to attend most meetings
of the Committee, Franklin made several small changes to the draft sent to him
by Thomas Jefferson. The rebellious states defeated Great Britain in the
American Revolutionary War, the first successful colonial war of independence.
While the states had already rejected the governance of Parliament, through the
Declaration the new United States now rejected the legitimacy of the monarchy
to demand allegiance. The war raged for seven years, with effective American
victory, followed by formal British abandonment of any claims to the United
States with the Treaty of Paris. The Philadelphia Convention set up the current
United States; the United States Constitution ratification the following year
made the states part of a single republic with a limited central government.
The Bill of Rights, comprising ten constitutional amendments guaranteeing many
fundamental civil rights and freedoms, was ratified in 1791. The French
Revolutions. Toward the middle and latter stages of the Age of Revolution, the
French political and social revolutions and radical change saw the French
governmental structure, previously an absolute monarchy with feudal privileges
for the aristocracy and Catholic clergy transform, change to forms based on
Enlightenment principles of citizenship and inalienable rights. The first
revolution led to government by the National Assembly, the second by the
Legislative Assembly, and the third by the Directory. The changes were
accompanied by violent turmoil which included the trial and execution of the
king, vast bloodshed and repression during the Reign of Terror, and warfare
involving every other major European power. Subsequent events that can be
traced to the Revolution include the Napoleonic Wars, two separate restorations
of the monarchy, and two additional revolutions as modern France took shape. In
the following century, France would be governed at one point or another as a
republic, constitutional monarchy, and two different empires. National and
Legislative Assembly. During the French Revolution, the National Assembly,
which existed from June 17 to July 9 of 1789, was a transitional body between
the Estates-General and the National Constituent Assembly. The Legislative
Assembly was the legislature of France from October 1, 1791 to September 1792.
It provided the focus of political debate and revolutionary law-making between
the periods of the National Constituent Assembly and of the National
Convention. The Directory and Napoleonic Era. The Executive Directory was a
body of five Directors that held executive power in France following the
Convention and preceding the Consulate. The period of this regime (2 November
1795 until 10 November 1799), commonly known as the Directory (or Directoire)
era, constitutes the second to last stage of the French Revolution. The
Napoleonic Era is a period in the History of France and Europe. It is generally
classified as the fourth stage of the French Revolution. The Napoleonic Era
begins roughly with Napoleon's coup d'√©tat, overthrowing the Directory and
ends at the Hundred Days and his defeat at Waterloo (November 9, 1799 ‚Äì June
28, 1815). The congress of Vienna soon set out to restore Europe to pre-French
revolution days. Italian unification. Italian unification was the political and
social movement that annexed different states of the Italian peninsula into the
single state of Italy in the 19th century. There is a lack of consensus on the
exact dates for the beginning and the end of this period, but many scholars
agree that the process began with the end of Napoleonic rule and the Congress
of Vienna in 1815, and approximately ended with the Franco-Prussian War in
1871, though the last "citt√  irredente" did not join the Kingdom of Italy
until after World War I. Eastern colonization. The development of New
Imperialism saw the conquest of nearly all eastern hemisphere territories by
colonial powers. The commercial colonization of India commenced in 1757, after
the Battle of Plassey, when the Nawab of Bengal surrendered his dominions to
the British East India Company, in 1765, when the Company was granted the
"diwani", or the right to collect revenue, in Bengal and Bihar, or in 1772,
when the Company established a capital in Calcutta, appointed its first
Governor-General, Warren Hastings, and became directly involved in governance.
The Maratha states, following the Anglo-Maratha wars, eventually lost to the
British East India Company in 1818. The rule lasted until 1858, when, after the
Indian rebellion of 1857 and consequent of the Government of India Act 1858,
the British government assumed the task of directly administering India in the
new British Raj. In 1819 Stamford Raffles established Singapore as a key
trading post for Britain in their rivalry with the Dutch. However, their
rivalry cooled in 1824 when an Anglo-Dutch treaty demarcated their respective
interests in Southeast Asia. From the 1850s onwards, the pace of colonization
shifted to a significantly higher gear. The Dutch East India Company (1800) and
British East India Company (1858) were dissolved by their respective
governments, who took over the direct administration of the colonies. Only
Thailand was spared the experience of foreign rule, although, Thailand itself
was also greatly affected by the power politics of the Western powers. Colonial
rule had a profound effect on Southeast Asia. While the colonial powers
profited much from the region's vast resources and large market, colonial rule
did develop the region to a varying extent. Decolonization of the Americas.
Decolonization of the Americas refers to the process by which the countries in
the Americas gained their independence from European rule. Decolonization began
with a series of revolutions in the late 18th and early-to-mid-19th centuries.
The Spanish American wars of independence were the numerous wars against
Spanish rule in Spanish America that took place during the early 19th century,
from 1808 until 1829, directly related to the Napoleonic French invasion of
Spain. The conflict started with short-lived governing juntas established in
Chuquisaca and Quito opposing the composition of the Supreme Central Junta of
Seville. When the Central Junta fell to the French, numerous new Juntas
appeared all across the Americas, eventually resulting in a chain of newly
independent countries stretching from Argentina and Chile in the south, to
Mexico in the north. After the death of the king Ferdinand VII, in 1833, only
Cuba and Puerto Rico remained under Spanish rule, until the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican
War in 1898. Unlike the Spanish, the Portuguese did not divide their colonial
territory in America. The captaincies they created were subdued to a
centralized administration in Salvador (later relocated to Rio de Janeiro)
which reported directly to the Portuguese Crown until its independence in 1822,
becoming the Empire of Brazil. Modern Age. "Late modern period" Industrial
revolutions. The date of the Industrial Revolution is not exact. Eric Hobsbawm
held that it 'broke out' in the 1780s and was not fully felt until the 1830s or
1840s, while T.S. Ashton held that it occurred roughly between 1760 and 1830
(in effect the reigns of George III, The Regency, and George IV). The great
changes of centuries before the 19th were more connected with ideas, religion
or military conquest, and technological advance had only made small changes in
the material wealth of ordinary people. The first Industrial Revolution merged
into the Second Industrial Revolution around 1850, when technological and
economic progress gained momentum with the development of steam-powered ships
and railways, and later in the 19th century with the internal combustion engine
and electric power generation. The Second Industrial Revolution was a phase of
the Industrial Revolution; sometimes labeled as the separate Technical
Revolution. From a technological and a social point of view there is no clean
break between the two. Major innovations during the period occurred in the
chemical, electrical, petroleum, and steel industries. Specific advancements
included the introduction of oil fired steam turbine and internal combustion
driven steel ships, the development of the airplane, the practical
commercialization of the automobile, mass production of consumer goods, the
perfection of canning, mechanical refrigeration and other food preservation
techniques, and the invention of the telephone. Industrialization.
Industrialization is the process of social and economic change whereby a human
group is transformed from a pre-industrial society into an industrial one. It
is a subdivision of a more general modernization process, where social change
and economic development are closely related with technological innovation,
particularly with the development of large-scale energy and metallurgy
production. It is the extensive organization of an economy for the purpose of
manufacturing. Industrialization also introduces a form of philosophical
change, where people obtain a different attitude towards their perception of
nature. Revolution in manufacture and power. An economy based on manual labour
was replaced by one dominated by industry and the manufacture of machinery. It
began with the mechanization of the textile industries and the development of
iron-making techniques, and trade expansion was enabled by the introduction of
canals, improved roads, and then railways. The introduction of steam power
(fuelled primarily by coal) and powered machinery (mainly in textile
manufacturing) underpinned the dramatic increases in production capacity. The
development of all-metal machine tools in the first two decades of the 19th
century facilitated the manufacture of more production machines for
manufacturing in other industries. The modern petroleum industry started in
1846 with the discovery of the process of refining kerosene from coal by Nova
Scotian Abraham Pineo Gesner. Ignacy ≈Åukasiewicz improved Gesner's method to
develop a means of refining kerosene from the more readily available "rock oil"
("petr-oleum") seeps in 1852 and the first rock oil mine was built in B√≥brka,
near Krosno in Galicia in the following year. In 1854, Benjamin Silliman, a
science professor at Yale University in New Haven, was the first to fractionate
petroleum by distillation. These discoveries rapidly spread around the world.
Notable engineers. Engineering achievements of the revolution ranged from
electrification to developments in materials science. The advancements made a
great contribution to the quality of life. In the first revolution, Lewis Paul
was the original inventor of roller spinning, the basis of the water frame for
spinning cotton in a cotton mill. Matthew Boulton and James Watt's improvements
to the steam engine were fundamental to the changes brought by the Industrial
Revolution in both the Kingdom of Great Britain and the world. In the latter
part of the second revolution, Thomas Alva Edison developed many devices that
greatly influenced life around the world and is often credited with the
creation of the first industrial research laboratory. In 1882, Edison switched
on the world's first large-scale electrical supply network that provided 110
volts direct current to fifty-nine customers in lower Manhattan. Also toward
the end of the second industrial revolution, Nikola Tesla made many
contributions in the field of electricity and magnetism in the late 19th and
early 20th centuries. Much of Tesla's early work in electrical engineering and
many of his discoveries were of importance. Tesla's patents and theoretical
work formed the basis of modern alternating current electric power systems,
including the polyphase systems power distribution and the alternating current
motor, with which he helped usher in the Second Industrial Revolution. In 1887,
Tesla filed a number of patents related to a competing form of power
distribution known as alternating current. In the following years a bitter
rivalry between Tesla and Edison, known as the "War of Currents", took place
over the preferred method of distribution. After Tesla's demonstration of
wireless communication (radio) in 1894 and after being the victor in the "War
of Currents", he was widely respected as one of the greatest electrical
engineers who worked in America. Social effects and classes. The Industrial
Revolutions were major technological, socioeconomic, and cultural changes in
late 18th and early 19th centuries that began in Britain and spread throughout
the world. The effects spread throughout Western Europe and North America
during the 19th century, eventually affecting the majority of the world. The
impact of this change on society was enormous and is often compared to the
Neolithic revolution, when mankind developed agriculture and gave up its
nomadic lifestyle. It has been argued that GDP per capita was much more stable
and progressed at a much slower rate until the industrial revolution and the
emergence of the modern capitalist economy, and that it has since increased
rapidly in capitalist countries. Mid-19th century European revolts. The
European Revolutions of 1848, known in some countries as the Spring of Nations
or the Year of Revolution, were a series of political upheavals throughout the
European continent. Described as a revolutionary wave, the period of unrest
began in France and then, further propelled by the French Revolution of 1848,
soon spread to the rest of Europe. Although most of the revolutions were
quickly put down, there was a significant amount of violence in many areas,
with tens of thousands of people tortured and killed. While the immediate
political effects of the revolutions were reversed, the long-term
reverberations of the events were far-reaching. Industrial age reformism.
Industrial age reform movements began the gradual change of society rather with
episodes of rapid fundamental changes. The reformists' ideas were often
grounded in liberalism, although they also possessed aspects of utopian,
socialist or religious concepts. The Radical movement campaigned for electoral
reform, a reform of the Poor Laws, free trade, educational reform, postal
reform, prison reform, and public sanitation. Following the Enlightenment's
ideas, the reformers looked to the Scientific Revolution and industrial
progress to solve the social problems which arose with the Industrial
Revolution. Newton's natural philosophy combined a mathematics of axiomatic
proof with the mechanics of physical observation, yielding a coherent system of
verifiable predictions and replacing a previous reliance on revelation and
inspired truth. Applied to public life, this approach yielded several
successful campaigns for changes in social policy. Imperial Russia. Under Peter
I ("the Great"), Russia was proclaimed an Empire in 1721 and became recognized
as a world power. Ruling from 1682 to 1725, Peter defeated Sweden in the Great
Northern War, forcing it to cede West Karelia and Ingria (two regions lost by
Russia in the Time of Troubles), as well as Estland and Livland, securing
Russia's access to the sea and sea trade. On the Baltic Sea Peter founded a new
capital called Saint Petersburg, later known as Russia's "Window to Europe".
Peter the Great's reforms brought considerable Western European cultural
influences to Russia. Catherine II ("the Great"), who ruled in 1762‚Äì96,
extended Russian political control over the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and
incorporated most of its territories into Russia during the Partitions of
Poland, pushing the Russian frontier westward into Central Europe. In the
south, after successful Russo-Turkish Wars against the Ottoman Empire,
Catherine advanced Russia's boundary to the Black Sea, defeating the Crimean
khanate. European Hegemony and the 19th century. Historians sometimes define
the 19th century historical era stretching from 1815 (the Congress of Vienna)
to 1914 (the outbreak of the First World War); alternatively, Eric Hobsbawm
defined the "Long Nineteenth Century" as spanning the years 1789 to 1914.
During this time, the fall of the Spanish Armada enabled the rise of the
British Empire. Imperialism and empires. During the 19th century, the Spanish,
Portuguese, and Ottoman empires began to crumble and the Holy Roman and Mughal
empires ceased. Following the Napoleonic Wars, the British Empire became the
world's leading power, controlling one quarter of the World's population and
one third of the land area. It enforced a Pax Britannica, encouraged trade, and
battled rampant piracy. Electricity, steel, and petroleum enabled Germany to
become great international power that raced to create empires of its own. The
Meiji Restoration was a chain of events that led to enormous changes in Japan's
political and social structure that was taking a firm hold at the beginning of
the Meiji Era which coincided the opening of Japan by the arrival of the Black
Ships of Commodore Matthew Perry and made Imperial Japan a great power.
However, Russia and Qing Dynasty China failed to keep pace with the other world
powers which led to massive social unrest in both empires. The Qing Dynasty's
military power weakened during the 19th century, and faced with international
pressure, massive rebellions and defeats in wars, the dynasty declined after
the mid-19th century. European powers controlled parts of Oceania, with French
New Caledonia from 1853 and French Polynesia from 1889; the Germans established
colonies in New Guinea in 1884, and Samoa in 1900. The United States expanded
into the Pacific with Hawaii becoming a U.S. territory from 1898. Disagreements
between the US, Germany and UK over Samoa led to the Tripartite Convention of
1899. British Victorian era. The Victorian era of the United Kingdom was the
period of Queen Victoria's reign from June 1837 to January 1901. This was a
long period of prosperity for the British people, as profits gained from the
overseas British Empire, as well as from industrial improvements at home,
allowed a large, educated middle class to develop. Some scholars would extend
the beginning of the period‚Äîas defined by a variety of sensibilities and
political games that have come to be associated with the Victorians‚Äîback five
years to the passage of the Reform Act 1832. In Britain's "imperial century",
Victory over Napoleon left Britain without any serious international rival,
other than Russia in central Asia. Unchallenged at sea, Britain adopted the
role of global policeman, a state of affairs later known as the "Pax
Britannica", and a foreign policy of "splendid isolation". Alongside the formal
control it exerted over its own colonies, Britain's dominant position in world
trade meant that it effectively controlled the economies of many nominally
independent countries, such as China, Argentina and Siam, which has been
generally characterized as "informal empire". Of note during this time was the
Anglo-Zulu War, which was fought in 1879 between the British Empire and the
Zulu Empire. British imperial strength was underpinned by the steamship and the
telegraph, new technologies invented in the second half of the 19th century,
allowing it to control and defend the Empire. By 1902, the British Empire was
linked together by a network of telegraph cables, the so-called All Red Line.
Growing until 1922, around of territory and roughly 458 million people were
added to the British Empire. The British established colonies in Australia in
1788, New Zealand in 1840 and Fiji in 1872, with much of Oceania becoming part
of the British Empire. French governments and conflicts. The Bourbon
Restoration followed the ousting of Napoleon I of France in 1814. The Allies
restored the Bourbon Dynasty to the French throne. The ensuing period is called
the Restoration, following French usage, and is characterized by a sharp
conservative reaction and the re-establishment of the Roman Catholic Church as
a power in French politics. The July Monarchy was a period of liberal
constitutional monarchy in France under King Louis-Philippe starting with the
July Revolution (or Three Glorious Days) of 1830 and ending with the Revolution
of 1848. The Second Empire was the Imperial Bonapartist regime of Napoleon III
from 1852 to 1870, between the Second Republic and the Third Republic, in
France. The Franco-Prussian War was a conflict between France and Prussia,
while Prussia was backed up by the North German Confederation, of which it was
a member, and the South German states of Baden, W√ºrttemberg and Bavaria. The
complete Prussian and German victory brought about the final unification of
Germany under King Wilhelm I of Prussia. It also marked the downfall of
Napoleon III and the end of the Second French Empire, which was replaced by the
Third Republic. As part of the settlement, almost all of the territory of
Alsace-Lorraine was taken by Prussia to become a part of Germany, which it
would retain until the end of World War I. The French Third Republic was the
republican government of France between the end of the Second French Empire
following the defeat of Louis-Napol√©on in the Franco-Prussian war in 1870 and
the Vichy Regime after the invasion of France by the German Third Reich in
1940. The Third Republic endured seventy years, making it the most long-lasting
regime in France since the collapse of the Ancien R√©gime in the French
Revolution of 1789. Slavery and abolition. Slavery was greatly reduced around
the world in the 19th century. Following a successful slave revolt in Haiti,
Britain forced the Barbary pirates to halt their practice of kidnapping and
enslaving Europeans, banned slavery throughout its domain, and charged its navy
with ending the global slave trade. Slavery was then abolished in Russia,
America, and Brazil (see Abolitionism). African colonization. Following the
abolition of the slave trade, and propelled by economic exploitation, the
Scramble for Africa was initiated formally at the Berlin West Africa Conference
in 1884‚Äì1885. All the major European powers laid claim to the areas of Africa
where they could exhibit a sphere of influence over the area. These claims did
not have to have any substantial land holdings or treaties to be legitimate.
The French gained major ground in West Africa, the British in East Africa, and
the Portuguese and Spanish at various points throughout the continent, while
King Leopold was able to retain his personal fiefdom, Congo. Meiji Japan.
Around the end of the 19th century and into the 20th century, the Meiji era was
a marked by the reign of the Meiji Emperor. During this time, Japan started its
modernization and rose to world power status. This era name means "Enlightened
Rule". It was not until the beginning of the Meiji Era that the Japanese
government began taking modernization seriously. Japan expanded its military
production base by opening arsenals in various locations. The hyobusho (war
office) was replaced with a War Department and a Naval Department. The samurai
class suffered great disappointment the following years. Laws were instituted
that required every able-bodied male Japanese citizen, regardless of class, to
serve a mandatory term of three years with the first reserves and two
additional years with the second reserves. This action, the deathblow for the
samurai warriors and their daimyo feudal lords, initially met resistance from
both the peasant and warrior alike. The peasant class interpreted the term for
military service, ketsu-eki (blood tax) literally, and attempted to avoid
service by any means necessary. The Japanese government began modelling their
ground forces after the French military. The French government contributed
greatly to the training of Japanese officers. Many were employed at the
military academy in Kyoto, and many more still were feverishly translating
French field manuals for use in the Japanese ranks. After the death of the
Meiji Emperor, the Taish≈ç Emperor took the throne, thus beginning the Taish≈ç
period. A key foreign observer of the remarkable and rapid changes in Japanese
society in this period was Ernest Mason Satow. United States egress. Antebellum
expansion. The Antebellum Age was the a period of increasing sectionalism that
led up to the American Civil War. The Antebellum Age was a time of great
transition because of the industrial revolution in America. It also was a time
of growth in slavery in the American South. In a sense, the Antebellum Period
is often considered to have begun with the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854, though
it is sometimes stipulated to extend back as early as 1812. "Manifest Destiny"
was the territorial expansion of the United States from 1812 to 1860. Manifest
Destiny incorporated the belief that the United States was destined, even
divinely ordained, to expand across the North American continent, from the
Atlantic seaboard to the Pacific Ocean. This era, from the end of the War of
1812 to the beginning of the American Civil War, has been called the "Age of
Manifest Destiny." During this time, the United States expanded to the Pacific
Ocean‚Äî"from sea to shining sea"‚Äîlargely defining the borders of the
contiguous United States as they are today. US Civil War and Reconstruction.
The American Civil War was a civil war in the United States of America. Eleven
Southern slave states declared their secession from the U.S. and formed the
Confederate States of America (the Confederacy). Led by Jefferson Davis, they
fought against the U.S. federal government (the Union), which was supported by
all the free states and the five border slave states in the north. Northern
leaders agreed that victory would require more than the end of fighting. It had
to encompass the two strategies: secession had to be totally repudiated and all
forms of slavery had to be eliminated. They disagreed sharply on the military
tactics and political tactics for these goals. They also disagreed on the
degree of federal control, that should be imposed on the South and the process
by which Southern states should be reintegrated into the Union. The
Reconstruction Era in United States history existed in the post-Civil War era
in the entire United States between 1865 and 1877. The Gilded Age and legacy.
During the Gilded Age, there was substantial growth in population in the United
States and extravagant displays of wealth and excess of America's upper-class
during the post-Civil War and post-Reconstruction era, in the late 19th
century. The wealth polarization derived primarily from industrial and
population expansion. The businessmen of the Second Industrial Revolution
created industrial towns and cities in the Northeast with new factories, and
contributed to the creation of an ethnically diverse industrial working class
which produced the wealth owned by rising super-rich industrialists and
financiers called the "robber barons". An example is the company of John D.
Rockefeller, who was an important figure in shaping the new oil industry. Using
highly effective tactics and aggressive practices, later widely criticized,
Standard Oil absorbed or destroyed most of its competition. The creation of a
modern industrial economy took place. With the creation of a transportation and
communication infrastructure, the corporation became the dominant form of
business organization and a managerial revolution transformed business
operations. In 1890, Congress passed the Sherman Antitrust Act‚Äîthe source of
all American anti-monopoly laws. The law forbade every contract, scheme, deal,
or conspiracy to restrain trade, though the phrase "restraint of trade"
remained subjective. By the beginning of the 20th century, per capita income
and industrial production in the United States exceeded that of any other
country except Britain. Long hours and hazardous working conditions led many
workers to attempt to form labor unions despite strong opposition from
industrialists and the courts. But the courts did protect the marketplace,
declaring the Standard Oil group to be an "unreasonable" monopoly under the
Sherman Antitrust Act in 1911. It ordered Standard to break up into 34
independent companies with different boards of directors. Transitions and
Enlightenment negation. Around the start of the 20th century, Enlightenment
philosophy was challenged in various quarters. After the use of classical
physics since the end of the scientific revolution, "modern physics" arose with
the advent of quantum physics; substituting mathematics studies for
experimental studies and examining equations to build a theoretical structure.
The old quantum theory was a collection of results which predate modern quantum
mechanics, but were never complete or self-consistent. The collection of
heuristic prescriptions for quantum mechanics were the first corrections to
classical mechanics. In addition, the various number of aether theories in
classical physics which supposed a "fifth element", such as the Luminiferous
aether, was nullified by the Michelson-Morley experiment in an attempt to
detect the motion of earth through the aether. In biology, Darwinism gained
acceptance and exposed adaptation in the theory of natural selection. The
fields of geology, astronomy and psychology also made strides and gained new
insights. In medicine, there were advances of medical theory and treatments.
Another philosophical trend was Chinese philosophy began to integrate concepts
of Western philosophy, as steps toward modernization. By the time of the Xinhai
Revolution in 1911, there were many calls, such as the May Fourth Movement, to
completely abolish the old imperial institutions and practices of China. There
have been attempts to incorporate democracy, republicanism, and industrialism
into Chinese philosophy, notably by Sun Yat-Sen ("S≈´n y√¨ xiƒÅn", in one
Mandarin form of the name) at the beginning of the 20th century. Mao Zedong
("M√°o z√© d≈çng") added Marxism-Leninism thought. When the Communist Party of
China took over power, previous schools of thought, excepting notably Legalism,
were denounced as backward, and later even purged during the Cultural
Revolution. Developed from earlier secular traditions, modern Humanism ethical
philosophies affirm the dignity and worth of all people, based on the ability
to determine right and wrong by appealing to universal human qualities,
particularly rationality, without resorting to the supernatural or alleged
divine authority from religious texts. For liberal humanists such as Rousseau
or Kant, the universal law of reason guided the way towards total emancipation
from any kind of tyranny. These ideas were challenged. The young Karl Marx
criticized the project of political emancipation (embodied in the form of human
rights), asserting it to be symptomatic of the very dehumanization it is
supposed to oppose. For Friedrich Nietzsche, humanism was nothing more than a
secular version of theism. In his "Genealogy of Morals", he argues that human
rights exist as a means for the weak to collectively constrain the strong. On
this view, such rights do not facilitate emancipation of life, but rather deny
it. In the 20th century, the notion that human beings are rationally autonomous
was challenged by the concept that humans were driven by unconscious irrational
desires. Notable persons. Sigmund Freud is renowned for his redefinition of
sexual desire as the primary motivational energy of human life, as well as his
therapeutic techniques, including the use of free association, his theory of
transference in the therapeutic relationship, and the interpretation of dreams
as sources of insight into unconscious desires. Albert Einstein is known for
his theories of special relativity and general relativity. He also made
important contributions to statistical mechanics, especially his mathematical
treatment of Brownian motion, his resolution of the paradox of specific heats,
and his connection of fluctuations and dissipation. Despite his reservations
about its interpretation, Einstein also made contributions to quantum mechanics
and, indirectly, quantum field theory, primarily through his theoretical
studies of the photon. Social Darwinism. At the end of the 19th century, Social
Darwinism was promoted and included the various ideologies based on a concept
that competition among all individuals, groups, nations, or ideas was a
"natural" framework for social evolution in human societies. In this view,
society's advancement is dependent on the "survival of the fittest", the term
was in fact coined by Herbert Spencer and referred to in "The Gospel of Wealth"
theory written by Andrew Carnegie. Marxist society. The "Manifesto" went
through a number of editions from 1872 to 1890; notable new prefaces were
written by Marx and Engels for the 1872 German edition, the 1882 Russian
edition, the 1883 German edition, and the 1888 English edition. In general,
Marxism identified five (and one transitional) successive stages of development
in Western Europe. European decline and the 20th century. Major political
developments saw the former British Empire lose most of its remaining political
power over commonwealth countries. The Trans-Siberian Railway, crossing Asia by
train, was complete by 1916. Other events include the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian
conflict, two world wars, and the Cold War. Australian Constitution. In 1901,
the Federation of Australia was the process by which the six separate British
self-governing colonies of New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia,
Tasmania, Victoria and Western Australia formed one nation. They kept the
systems of government that they had developed as separate colonies but also
would have a federal government that was responsible for matters concerning the
whole nation. When the Constitution of Australia came into force, the colonies
collectively became states of the Commonwealth of Australia. Eastern warlords.
The last days of the Qing Dynasty were marked by civil unrest and foreign
invasions. Responding to these civil failures and discontent, the Qing Imperial
Court did attempt to reform the government in various ways, such as the
decision to draft a constitution in 1906, the establishment of provincial
legislatures in 1909, and the preparation for a national parliament in 1910.
However, many of these measures were opposed by the conservatives of the Qing
Court, and many reformers were either imprisoned or executed outright. The
failures of the Imperial Court to enact such reforming measures of political
liberalization and modernization caused the reformists to steer toward the road
of revolution. In 1912, the Republic of China was established and was
inaugurated in Nanjing as the first Provisional President. But power in Beijing
already had passed to Yuan Shikai, who had effective control of the Beiyang
Army, the most powerful military force in China at the time. To prevent civil
war and possible foreign intervention from undermining the infant republic,
leaders agreed to Army's demand that China be united under a Beijing
government. On March 10, in Beijing, Shikai was sworn in as the second
Provisional President of the Republic of China. After the early 20th century
revolutions, shifting alliances of China's regional warlords fought for control
of the Beijing government. Despite the fact that various warlords gained
control of the government in Beijing during the warlord era, this did not
constitute a new era of control or governance, because other warlords did not
acknowledge the transitory governments in this period and were a law unto
themselves. These military-dominated governments were collectively known as the
Beiyang government. The warlord era is ends around in 1927. World Wars era.
start of the 20th century. Begun at the Battle of Port Arthur, the Russo-
Japanese War establishes the Empire of Japan as a world power. The Russians
were in constant pursuit of a warm water port on the Pacific Ocean, for their
navy as well as for maritime trade. The Manchurian Campaign of the Russian
Empire was fought against the Japanese over Manchuria and Korea. The major
theatres of operations were Southern Manchuria, specifically the area around
the Liaodong Peninsula and Mukden, and the seas around Korea, Japan, and the
Yellow Sea. The resulting campaigns, in which the fledgling Japanese military
consistently attained victory over the Russian forces arrayed against them,
were unexpected by world observers. These victories, as time transpired, would
dramatically transform the distribution of power in East Asia, resulting in a
reassessment of Japan's recent entry onto the world stage. The embarrassing
string of defeats increased Russian popular dissatisfaction with the
inefficient and corrupt Tsarist government. The Russian Revolution of 1905 was
a wave of mass political unrest through vast areas of the Russian Empire. Some
of it was directed against the government, while some was undirected. It
included terrorism, worker strikes, peasant unrests, and military mutinies. It
led to the establishment of the limited constitutional monarchy, the
establishment of State Duma of the Russian Empire, the multi-party system and
Russian Constitution of 1906. In China, the Qing Dynasty was overthrown
following the Xinhai Revolution. The "Xinhai Revolution" began with the Wuchang
Uprising on October 10, 1911 and ended with the abdication of Emperor Puyi on
February 12, 1912. The primary parties to the conflict were the Imperial forces
of the Qing Dynasty (1644‚Äì1911), and the revolutionary forces of the Chinese
Revolutionary Alliance (Tongmenghui). Edwardian Britain. The Edwardian era in
the United Kingdom is the period spanning the reign of King Edward VII up to
the end of the First World War, including the years surrounding the sinking of
the RMS "Titanic". In the early years of the period, the Second Boer War in
South Africa split the country into anti- and pro-war factions. The imperial
policies of the Conservatives eventually proved unpopular and in the general
election of 1906 the Liberals won a huge landslide. The Liberal government was
unable to proceed with all of its radical programme without the support of the
House of Lords, which was largely Conservative. Conflict between the two Houses
of Parliament over the People's Budget led to a reduction in the power of the
peers in 1910. The general election in January that year returned a hung
parliament with the balance of power held by Labour and Irish Nationalist
members. World War I. The causes of World War I included many factors,
including the conflicts and antagonisms of the four decades leading up to the
war. The Triple Entente was the name given to the loose alignment between the
United Kingdom, France, and Russia after the signing of the Anglo-Russian
Entente in 1907. The alignment of the three powers, supplemented by various
agreements with Japan, the United States, and Spain, constituted a powerful
counterweight to the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy,
the third having concluded an additional secret agreement with France
effectively nullifying her Alliance commitments. Militarism, alliances,
imperialism, and nationalism played major roles in the conflict. The immediate
origins of the war lay in the decisions taken by statesmen and generals during
the July crisis of 1914, the spark (or casus belli) for which was the
assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria. However, the crisis did
not exist in a void; it came after a long series of diplomatic clashes between
the Great Powers over European and colonial issues in the decade prior to 1914
which had left tensions high. The diplomatic clashes can be traced to changes
in the balance of power in Europe since 1870. An example is the Baghdad Railway
which was planned to connect the Ottoman Empire cities of Konya and Baghdad
with a line through modern-day Turkey, Syria and Iraq. The railway became a
source of international disputes during the years immediately preceding World
War I. Although it has been argued that they were resolved in 1914 before the
war began, it has also been argued that the railroad was a cause of the First
World War. Fundamentally the war was sparked by tensions over territory in the
Balkans. Austria-Hungary competed with Serbia and Russia for territory and
influence in the region and they pulled the rest of the great powers into the
conflict through their various alliances and treaties. The Balkan Wars were two
wars in South-eastern Europe in 1912‚Äì1913 in the course of which the Balkan
League (Bulgaria, Montenegro, Greece, and Serbia) first captured Ottoman-held
remaining part of Thessaly, Macedonia, Epirus, Albania and most of Thrace and
then fell out over the division of the spoils, with incorporation of Romania
this time. [[Image:World War 1.gif|thumb||600px|center|Various periods of World

Central Powers in the First World War Ultimately, World War I created a
decisive break with the old world order that had emerged after the Napoleonic
Wars, which was modified by the mid-19th century's nationalistic revolutions.
The results of World War I would be important factors in the development of
World War II approximately 20 years later. More immediate to the time, the
"partitioning of the Ottoman Empire" was a political event that redrew the
political boundaries of the Middle East. The huge conglomeration of territories
and peoples formerly ruled by the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire was divided into
several new nations. The partitioning brought the creation of the modern Arab
world and the Republic of Turkey. The League of Nations granted France mandates
over Syria and Lebanon and granted the United Kingdom mandates over Mesopotamia
and Palestine (which was later divided into two regions: Palestine and
Transjordan). Parts of the Ottoman Empire on the Arabian Peninsula became parts
of what are today Saudi Arabia and Yemen. Revolutions and war. The Russian
Revolution is the series of revolutions in Russia in 1917, which destroyed the
Tsarist autocracy and led to the creation of the Soviet Union. Following the
abdication of Nicholas II of Russia, the Russian Provisional Government was
established. In October 1917, a "red" faction revolution occurred in which the
Red Guard, armed groups of workers and deserting soldiers directed by the
Bolshevik Party, seized control of Saint Petersburg (then known as Petrograd)
and began an immediate armed takeover of cities and villages throughout the
former Russian Empire. In addition, there was a concern, shared by many Central
Powers as well, that the socialist revolutionary ideas would spread to the
West. Hence, many of these countries expressed their support for the Whites,
including the provision of troops and supplies. Winston Churchill declared that
Bolshevism must be "strangled in its cradle". The Russian Civil War was a
multi-party war that occurred within the former Russian Empire after the
Russian provisional government collapsed and the Soviets under the domination
of the Bolshevik party assumed power, first in Petrograd (St. Petersburg) and
then in other places. In the wake of the October Revolution, the old Russian
Imperial Army had been demobilized; the volunteer-based Red Guard was the
Bolsheviks' main military force, augmented by an armed military component of
the Cheka, the Bolshevik state security apparatus. There was an instituted
mandatory conscription of the rural peasantry into the Red Army. Opposition of
rural Russians to Red Army conscription units was overcome by taking hostages
and shooting them when necessary in order to force compliance. Former Tsarist
officers were utilized as "military specialists" ("voenspetsy"), sometimes
taking their families hostage in order to ensure loyalty. At the start of the
war, three-fourths of the Red Army officer corps was composed of former Tsarist
officers. By its end, 83% of all Red Army divisional and corps commanders were
ex-Tsarist soldiers. The principal fighting occurred between the Bolshevik Red
Army and the forces of the White Army. Many foreign armies warred against the
Red Army, notably the Allied Forces, yet many volunteer foreigners fought in
both sides of the Russian Civil War. Other nationalist and regional political
groups also participated in the war, including the Ukrainian nationalist Green
Army, the Ukrainian anarchist Black Army and Black Guards, and warlords such as
Ungern von Sternberg. The most intense fighting took place from 1918 to 1920.
Major military operations ended on 25 October 1922 when the Red Army occupied
Vladivostok, previously held by the Provisional Priamur Government. The last
enclave of the White Forces was the Ayano-Maysky District on the Pacific coast.
The majority of the fighting ended in 1920 with the defeat of General Pyotr
Wrangel in the Crimea, but a notable resistance in certain areas continued
until 1923 (e.g., Kronstadt Uprising, Tambov Rebellion, Basmachi Revolt, and
the final resistance of the White movement in the Far East). In 1917, China
declared war on Germany in the hope of recovering its lost province, then under
Japanese control. The New Culture Movement occupied the period from 1917 to
1923. Chinese representatives refused to sign the Treaty of Versailles, due to
intense pressure from the student protesters and public opinion alike. The May
Fourth Movement helped to rekindle the then-fading cause of republican
revolution. In 1917 Sun Yat-sen had become commander-in-chief of a rival
military government in Guangzhou in collaboration with southern warlords. Sun
efforts to obtain aid from the Western democracies were ignored, however, and
in 1920 he turned to the Soviet Union, which had recently achieved its own
revolution. The Soviets sought to befriend the Chinese revolutionists by
offering scathing attacks on Western imperialism. But for political expediency,
the Soviet leadership initiated a dual policy of support for both Sun and the
newly established Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The policy of working with the
Kuomintang and Chiang Kai-shek had been recommended by the Dutch Communist Henk
Sneevliet, chosen in 1923 to be the Comintern representative in China due to
his revolutionary experience in the Dutch Indies, where he had a major role in
founding the Partai Komunis Indonesia (PKI) - and who felt that the Chinese
party was too small and weak to undertake a major effort on its own (see Henk
Sneevliet's work for the Comintern). In early 1927, the Kuomintang-CCP rivalry
led to a split in the revolutionary ranks. The CCP and the left wing of the
Kuomintang had decided to move the seat of the Nationalist government from
Guangzhou to Wuhan. But Chiang Kai-shek, whose Northern Expedition was proving
successful, set his forces to destroying the Shanghai CCP apparatus and
established an anti-Communist government at Nanjing in April 1927 - bloody
events. The 1920s and the Depression. The interwar period was the period
between the end of the First World War and the beginning of the Second World
War. This period was marked by turmoil in much of the world, as Europe
struggled to recover from the devastation of the First World War. In North
America, especially the first half of this period, people experienced
considerable prosperity in the Roaring Twenties. The social and societal
upheaval known as the Roaring Twenties began in North America and spread to
Europe in the aftermath of World War I. The "Roaring Twenties", often called
"The Jazz Age", saw an exposition of social, artistic, and cultural dynamism.
'Normalcy' returned to politics, jazz music blossomed, the flapper redefined
modern womanhood, Art Deco peaked. The spirit of the Roaring Twenties was
marked by a general feeling of discontinuity associated with modernity, a break
with traditions. Everything seemed to be feasible through modern technology.
New technologies, especially automobiles, movies and radio proliferated
'modernity' to a large part of the population. The 1920s saw the general favor
of practicality, in architecture as well as in daily life. The 1920s was
further distinguished by several inventions and discoveries, extensive
industrial growth and the rise in consumer demand and aspirations, and
significant changes in lifestyle. Europe spent these years rebuilding and
coming to terms with the vast human cost of the conflict. The economy of the
United States became increasingly intertwined with that of Europe. In Germany,
the Weimar Republic gave way to episodes of political and economic turmoil,
which culminated with the German hyperinflation of 1923 and the failed Beer
Hall Putsch of that same year. When Germany could no longer afford war
payments, Wall Street invested heavily in European debts to keep the European
economy afloat as a large consumer market for American mass produced goods. By
the middle of the decade, economic development soared in Europe, and the
Roaring Twenties broke out in Germany, Britain and France, the second half of
the decade becoming known as the "Golden Twenties". In France and francophone
Canada, they were also called the ""ann√©es folles"" ("Crazy Years"). Worldwide
prosperity changed dramatically with the onset of the Great Depression in 1929.
The Wall Street Crash of 1929 served to punctuate the end of the previous era,
as "The Great Depression" set in. The "Great Depression" was a worldwide
economic downturn starting in most places in 1929 and ending at different times
in the 1930s or early 1940s for different countries. It was the largest and
most important economic depression in the 20th century, and is used in the 21st
century as an example of how far the world's economy can fall. The depression
had devastating effects in virtually every country, rich or poor. International
trade plunged by half to two-thirds, as did personal income, tax revenue,
prices and profits. Cities all around the world were hit hard, especially those
dependent on heavy industry. Construction was virtually halted in many
countries. Farming and rural areas suffered as crop prices fell by roughly 60
percent. Facing plummeting demand with few alternate sources of jobs, areas
dependent on primary sector industries suffered the most. The Great Depression
ended at different times in different countries with the effect lasting into
the next era. America's Great Depression ended in 1941 with America's entry
into World War II. The majority of countries set up relief programs, and most
underwent some sort of political upheaval, pushing them to the left or right.
In some world states, the desperate citizens turned toward nationalist
demagogues‚Äîthe most infamous being Adolf Hitler‚Äîsetting the stage for the
next era of war. The convulsion brought on by the worldwide depression resulted
in the rise of Nazism. In Asia, Japan became an ever more assertive power,
especially with regards to China. Nanjing period. The "Nanjing Decade" of 1928-
37 was one of consolidation and accomplishment under the leadership of the
Nationalists, with a mixed but generally positive record in the economy, social
progress, development of democracy, and cultural creativity. Some of the harsh
aspects of foreign concessions and privileges in China were moderated through
diplomacy. The League and crises. The interwar period was also marked by a
radical change in the international order, away from the balance of power that
had dominated pre‚ÄìWorld War I Europe. One main institution that was meant to
bring stability was the League of Nations, which was created after the First
World War with the intention of maintaining world security and peace and
encouraging economic growth between member countries. The League was undermined
by the bellicosity of Nazi Germany, Imperial Japan, the Soviet Union, and
Mussolini's Italy, and by the non-participation of the United States, leading
many to question its effectiveness and legitimacy. A series of international
crises strained the League to its limits, the earliest being the invasion of
Manchuria by Japan and the Abyssinian crisis of 1935/36 in which Italy invaded
Abyssinia, one of the only free African nations at that time. The League tried
to enforce economic sanctions upon Italy, but to no avail. The incident
highlighted French and British weakness, exemplified by their reluctance to
alienate Italy and lose her as their ally. The limited actions taken by the
Western powers pushed Mussolini's Italy towards alliance with Hitler's Germany
anyway. The Abyssinian war showed Hitler how weak the League was and encouraged
the remilitarization of the Rhineland in flagrant disregard of the Treaty of
Versailles. This was the first in a series of provocative acts culminating in
the invasion of Poland in September 1939 and the beginning of the Second World
War. Few Chinese had any illusions about Japanese designs on China. Hungry for
raw materials and pressed by a growing population, Japan initiated the seizure
of Manchuria in September 1931 and established ex-Qing emperor Puyi as head of
the puppet state of Manchukuo in 1932. During the Sino-Japanese War (1937-
1945), the loss of Manchuria, and its vast potential for industrial development
and war industries, was a blow to the Kuomintang economy. The League of
Nations, established at the end of World War I, was unable to act in the face
of the Japanese defiance. After 1940, conflicts between the Kuomintang and
Communists became more frequent in the areas not under Japanese control. The
Communists expanded their influence wherever opportunities presented themselves
through mass organizations, administrative reforms, and the land- and tax-
reform measures favoring the peasants‚Äîwhile the Kuomintang attempted to
neutralize the spread of Communist influence. Tripartite Pact. The Second Sino-
Japanese War had seen tensions rise between Imperial Japan and the United
States; events such as the Panay incident and the Nanking Massacre turned
American public opinion against Japan. With the occupation of French Indochina
in the years of 1940‚Äì41, and with the continuing war in China, the United
States placed embargoes on Japan of strategic materials such as scrap metal and
oil, which were vitally needed for the war effort. The Japanese were faced with
the option of either withdrawing from China and losing face or seizing and
securing new sources of raw materials in the resource-rich, European-controlled
colonies of South East Asia‚Äîspecifically British Malaya and the Dutch East
Indies (modern-day Indonesia). In 1940, Imperial Japan signed the Tripartite
Pact with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. World War II. The Second World War
was a global military conflict that took place in 1939‚Äì1945. It was the
largest and deadliest war in history, culminating in the Holocaust and ending
with the dropping of the atom bomb. Even though Japan had been fighting in
China since 1937, the conventional view is that the war began on September 1,
1939, when Nazi Germany invaded Poland, the Drang nach Osten. Within two days
the United Kingdom and France declared war on Germany, even though the fighting
was confined to Poland. Pursuant to a then-secret provision of its non-
aggression Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, the Soviet Union joined with Germany on
September 17, 1939, to conquer Poland and to divide Eastern Europe. The Allies
were initially made up of Poland, the United Kingdom, France, Australia,
Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, as well as British Commonwealth countries
which were controlled directly by the UK, such as the Indian Empire. All of
these countries declared war on Germany in September 1939. Following the lull
in fighting, known as the "Phoney War", Germany invaded western Europe in May
1940. Six weeks later, France, in the mean time attacked by Italy as well,
surrendered to Germany, which then tried unsuccessfully to conquer Britain. On
September 27, Germany, Italy, and Japan signed a mutual defense agreement, the
Tripartite Pact, and were known as the Axis Powers. Nine months later, on June
22, 1941, Germany launched a massive invasion of the Soviet Union, which
promptly joined the Allies. Germany was now engaged in fighting a war on two
fronts. This proved to be a mistake by Germany - Germany had not successfully
carried out the invasion of Britain and the war turned against of the Axis. On
December 7, 1941, Japan attacked the United States at Pearl Harbor, bringing it
too into the war on the Allied side. China also joined the Allies, as
eventually did most of the rest of the world. China was in turmoil at the time,
and attacked Japanese armies through guerilla-type warfare. By the beginning of
1942, the major combatants were aligned as follows: the British Commonwealth,
the United States, and the Soviet Union were fighting Germany and Italy; and
the British Commonwealth, China, and the United States were fighting Japan.
From then through August 1945, battles raged across all of Europe, in the North
Atlantic Ocean, across North Africa, throughout Southeast Asia, throughout
China, across the Pacific Ocean and in the air over Japan. Italy surrendered in
September 1943 and split in a northern Germany-occupied puppet state and in an
Allies-friendly state in the South; Germany surrendered in May 1945. Following
the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan surrendered, marking the
end of the war on September 2, 1945. It is possible that around 62 million
people died in the war; estimates vary greatly. About 60% of all casualties
were civilians, who died as a result of disease, starvation, genocide (in
particular, the Holocaust), and aerial bombing. The former Soviet Union and
China suffered the most casualties. Estimates place deaths in the Soviet Union
at around 23 million, while China suffered about 10 million. No country lost a
greater portion of its population than Poland: approximately 5.6 million, or
16%, of its pre-war population of 34.8 million died. The Holocaust (which
roughly means "burnt whole") was the deliberate and systematic murder of
millions of Jews and other "unwanted" during World War II by the Nazi regime in
Germany. Several differing views exist regarding whether it was intended to
occur from the war's beginning, or if the plans for it came about later.
Regardless, persecution of Jews extended well before the war even started, such
as in the "Kristallnacht" (Night of Broken Glass). The Nazis used propaganda to
great effect to stir up anti-Semitic feelings within ordinary Germans. After
World War II, Europe was informally split into Western and Soviet spheres of
influence. Western Europe later aligned as North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) and Eastern Europe as the Warsaw Pact. There was a shift in power from
Western Europe and the British Empire to the two new superpowers, the United
States and the Soviet Union. These two rivals would later face off in the Cold
War. In Asia, the defeat of Japan led to its democratization. China's civil war
continued through and after the war, resulting eventually in the establishment
of the People's Republic of China. The former colonies of the European powers
began their road to independence. Post-1945 world. The mid-20th century is
distinguished from most of human history in that its most significant changes
were directly or indirectly economic and technological in nature. Economic
development was the force behind vast changes in everyday life, to a degree
which was unprecedented in human history. Over the course of the 20th century,
the world's per-capita gross domestic product grew by a factor of five, much
more than all earlier centuries combined (including the 19th with its
Industrial Revolution). Many economists make the case that this understates the
magnitude of growth, as many of the goods and services consumed at the end of
the 20th century, such as improved medicine (causing world life expectancy to
increase by more than two decades) and communications technologies, were not
available at any price at its beginning. However, the gulf between the world's
rich and poor grew wider, and the majority of the global population remained in
the poor side of the divide. Still, advancing technology and medicine has had a
great impact even in the Global South. Large-scale industry and more
centralized media made brutal dictatorships possible on an unprecedented scale
in the middle of the century, leading to wars that were also unprecedented.
However, the increased communications contributed to democratization.
Technological developments included the development of airplanes and space
exploration, nuclear technology, advancement in genetics, and the dawning of
the Information Age. American Peace. Pax Americana is an appellation applied to
the historical concept of relative liberal peace in the Western world,
resulting from the preponderance of power enjoyed by the United States of
America starting around the start of the 20th century. Although the term finds
its primary utility in the latter half of the 20th century, it has been used in
various places and eras. Its modern connotations concern the peace established
after the end of World War II in 1945. Cold War era. The Cold War began in the
mid-1940s and lasted into the early 1990s. Throughout this period, the conflict
was expressed through military coalitions, espionage, weapons development,
invasions, propaganda, and competitive technological development. The conflict
included costly defense spending, a massive conventional and nuclear arms race,
and numerous proxy wars; the two superpowers never fought one another directly.
The Soviet Union created the Eastern Bloc of countries that it occupied,
annexing some as Soviet Socialist Republics and maintaining others as satellite
states that would later form the Warsaw Pact. The United States and various
western European countries began a policy of "containment" of communism and
forged myriad alliances to this end, including NATO. Several of these western
countries also coordinated efforts regarding the rebuilding of western Europe,
including western Germany, which the Soviets opposed. In other regions of the
world, such as Latin America and Southeast Asia, the Soviet Union fostered
communist revolutionary movements, which the United States and many of its
allies opposed and, in some cases, attempted to "roll back". Many countries
were prompted to align themselves with the nations that would later form either
NATO or the Warsaw Pact, though other movements would also emerge. The Cold War
saw periods of both heightened tension and relative calm. International crises
arose, such as the Berlin Blockade (1948‚Äì1949), the Korean War (1950‚Äì1953),
the Berlin Crisis of 1961, the Vietnam War (1959‚Äì1975), the Cuban Missile
Crisis (1962), the Soviet war in Afghanistan (1979‚Äì1989) and NATO exercises
in November 1983. There were also periods of reduced tension as both sides
sought d√©tente. Direct military attacks on adversaries were deterred by the
potential for mutual assured destruction using deliverable nuclear weapons. In
the Cold War era, the Generation of Love and the rise of computers changed
society in very different, complex ways, including higher social and local
mobility. The Cold War drew to a close in the late 1980s and the early 1990s.
The United States under President Ronald Reagan increased diplomatic, military,
and economic pressure on the Soviet Union, which was already suffering from
severe economic stagnation. In the second half of the 1980s, newly appointed
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev introduced the "perestroika" and "glasnost"
reforms. The Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, leaving the United States as the
dominant military power, though Russia retained much of the massive Soviet
nuclear arsenal. Latin America polarization. In Latin America in the 1970s,
leftists acquired a significant political influence which prompted the right-
wing, ecclesiastical authorities and a large portion of the individual
country's upper class to support coup d'√©tats to avoid what they perceived as
a communist threat. This was further fueled by Cuban and United States
intervention which led to a political polarization. Most South American
countries were in some periods ruled by military dictatorships that were
supported by the United States of America. Around the 1970s, the regimes of the
Southern Cone collaborated in Operation Condor killing many leftist dissidents,
including some urban guerrillas. However, by the early 1990s all countries had
restored their democracies. Space Age. The Space Age is a period encompassing
the activities related to the Space Race, space exploration, space technology,
and the cultural developments influenced by these events. The Space Age began
with the development of several technologies that culminated with the launch of
Sputnik 1 by the Soviet Union. This was the world's first artificial satellite,
orbiting the Earth in 98.1 minutes and weighing in at 83¬ kg. The launch of
Sputnik 1 ushered a new era of political, scientific and technological
achievements that became known as the Space Age. The Space Age was
characterized by rapid development of new technology in a close race mostly
between the United States and the Soviet Union. The Space Age reached its peak
with the Apollo program which captured the imagination of much of the world's
population. The landing of Apollo 11 was an event watched by over 500 million
people around the world and is widely recognized as one of the defining moments
of the 20th century. Since then and with the end of the space race due to the
dissolution of the Soviet Union, public attention has largely moved to other
areas. Contemporary era. In the Contemporary era, there were various socio-
technological trends, among the challenges and problems the modern world faces
is climate change. Regarding the 21st century and the late modern world, the
Information age and computers were forefront in use, not completely ubiquitous
but often present in daily life. The development of Eastern powers was of note,
with China and India becoming more powerful. In the Eurasian theater, the
European Union and Russian Federation were two forces recently developed. A
concern for Western world, if not the whole world, was the late modern form of
terrorism and the warfare that has resulted from the contemporary terrorist
acts. Modern history education and schools. The humanities are academic
disciplines which study the human condition, using methods that are primarily
analytic, critical, or speculative, as distinguished from the mainly empirical
approaches of the natural and social sciences. Although many of the subjects of
modern history coincide with that of standard history, the subject is taught
independently by various systems of education in the world. British education.
Students can choose the subject at university. The material covered includes
from the mid-18th century, to analysis of the present day. Virtually all
colleges and sixth forms that do teach modern history do it alongside standard
history; very few teach the subject exclusively. Universities. At the
University of Oxford 'Modern History' has a somewhat different meaning. The
contrast is not with the Middle Ages but with Antiquity. The earliest period
that can be studied in the Final Honour School of Modern History begins in 285.
