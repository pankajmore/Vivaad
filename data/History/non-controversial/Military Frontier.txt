Military Frontier The Military Frontier (also known as Military Border and
Military Krajina; ; ; ; ; ; ) was a borderland of Habsburg Austria and later
the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, which acted as the "cordon sanitaire" against
incursions from the Ottoman Empire. When created in the 16th century by
Ferdinand I, it was divided into two districts each under its own special
military administration: the Croatian Military Frontier and the Slavonian
Military Frontier. Both of these, along with all later military districts, were
placed under the unified control of the Croatian General Command in 1783. The
Military Frontier was a separate Habsburg administrative unit, directly
subordinated to Vienna. Its territory stretched from central Croatia in the
west to eastern Transylvania in the east and included parts of present-day
Croatia, Serbia, Romania and Hungary. History. Ottoman wars. The Ottoman wars
in Europe caused the border of the Kingdom of Hungary and subsequently the
Habsburg Monarchy to shift towards northwest. Much of the old Croatian
territory was either captured by the Ottomans or bordered the new Ottoman
domain. In 1435, in an attempt to strengthen the defences towards the Ottomans
and Venice, the king Sigismund founded the so-called "tabor", a military
encampment, each in Croatia, Slavonia and Usora. In 1463, the king Matthias
Corvinus founded the "banovina" of Jajce and Srebrenik, and in 1469 the
military captaincy of Senj, modeled after the Ottoman captaincies in the
Province of Bosnia. All these actions were intended to provide for better
defences, but were ultimately unsuccessful. It did bring forth the Croatian
Pandur infantry and the Serbian Hussar cavalry though. After 1526, the Austrian
Habsburgs were selected by the Croatian Parliament as kings of Croatia, and
Emperor Ferdinand promised the Croatian Parliament that he would give them 200
cavalrymen and 200 infantrymen, and that he would pay for another 800
cavalrymen who would be commanded by the Croatians. Soon the Habsburg Empire
founded another captaincy in Bihaƒá. In the short term, all this was also
ineffective, as in 1529 the Ottomans swept through the area, captured Buda and
besieged Vienna, wreaking havoc throughout the Croatian border areas. In 1553,
the borderland was reformed for the first time, under the commander Ivan
Lenkoviƒá. The frontier was split into the Croatian Krajina ("Krabatische
Gr√§nitz") and the Upper Slavonian Krajina ("Windische, Oberslawonische
Gr√§nitz"). The border with the Ottoman Empire on the line Senj-Otoƒçac-Slunj-
Glina-Hrastovica-Sisak-Ivaniƒá-Kri≈æevci-ƒêurƒëevac was fortified with several
smaller and larger forts. New captaincies were formed in the larger forts:
Ogulin, Hrastovica, ≈Ωumberak, Koprivnica, Kri≈æevci and Ivaniƒá. Smaller forts
were manned by German infantry and Croatian light infantry. The larger forts
were manned by German heavy cavalry and Croatian light cavalry. The new
military expenditures became a considerable concern, and the Congress of Inner
Austrian lands in Bruck an der Mur in 1578 defined the obligations of each land
in covering the military expenses and defined the priorities in improving the
defensive strategy. The nobility of Styria financed the Upper Slavonian
Frontier while the others (Lower Austria, Upper Austria, Carniola, Carinthia
and Salzburg) financed the Croatian Frontier. By the end of the 16th century,
the Croatian Krajina became known as the Karlovac "generalat", and since the
1630s the Upper Slavonian Krajina was known as the Vara≈ædin "generalat".
During the 16th and 17th centuries, the military administration of the Frontier
was moved away from the Croatian ban and the Sabor (Parliament) and instead
instated in the high command of Archduke Charles and the War Council in Graz.
Despite the financial support of the Inner Austrian nobility, the financing of
the Military Frontier was not efficient enough. The military leadership in Graz
decided to try solutions other than mercenary units. In the 1630s, the Imperial
Court decided to give land and certain privileges to immigrants into the
Frontier (the uskok guerrillas as well as refugees from Ottoman-controlled
lands) at the area of ≈Ωumberak, and in return they would serve in the Imperial
army. The remaining local population was also encouraged to remain by receiving
the status of free peasants (rather than serfs) and other privileges. These new
units were organized into ten or more "voivodeships" per each captaincy. In
November 1630, the Emperor proclaimed the so-called "Statuta Wallachorum" or
Vlach Statute [http://www.skdprosvjeta.com/page.php?id=33], which regulated the
status of so-called Vlach settlers (which included Croats, Serbs and Vlachs)
from the Ottoman Empire with regard to military command, their obligations and
rights to internal self-administration. Over time, the population of the
Frontier (as it was then) became mixed between the autochthonous Croats and
Croatian serfs who had fled the Ottoman territories, and the numerous minority
of Serb and Vlach (who were later assimilated into Croats and Serbs) refugees
who strove to expand their rights as a major contributor in the defense of the
land. By creating the new military class in the Frontier, the territory of the
Frontier eventually became fully detached from the Croatian Parliament and the
ban. The Territory of the Frontier had a large Serb population, who fled from
their south-eastern lands, and tried to fight the Ottoman forces, making a
refuge in Habsburg Croatia. As freedom of faith was granted to them, the
Orthodox faith was preserved in spite of their living in a Catholic country.
Eventually, the whole population of the Military Frontier became professional
soldiers that served an Empire on several fronts and through many European
wars, even after the disappearance of Ottoman threat. In 1673, the first
detailed map of the Military Frontier was released, where the funfair and the
public bath for border guard officers and other gentlemen from the neighborhood
in Miholjanec was marked. Their wives and children lived together in organized
agricultural cooperatives. After the Great Turkish War and Treaty of Karlowitz.
The 17th century was a relatively peaceful period, during which only smaller
raids were made from the Province of Bosnia. After the Ottoman army was
repelled at the Battle of Vienna in 1683, the Great Turkish War ended with much
of the former Croatian lands under Habsburg control. Despite this, the Frontier
system was retained, and expanded onto former Ottoman territories in Lika,
Kordun, Banija, lower Slavonia, Syrmia, Baƒçka, Banat, Pomori≈°je, and
Transylvania. The Empire valued the ability to centrally control the area and
draft cheap and numerous army units. After the Treaty of Karlowitz of 1699, a
unit called the "Sere≈æan" troop was formed, and it had both military and
police duties. The members were not paid, but were released of all taxes. As an
irregular unit, they wore a folk uniform rather than an army one. Over the
following century, each regiment had one section of the "sere≈æani", led by a
"oberba≈°a" or "haramba≈°a" (sergeant), several "unterba≈°a" (corporal) and
"viceba≈°a" (lance corporal). They organized the border patrols towards Bosnia,
particularly on difficult terrain, and stopped incursions of bandits. They had
to have extensive knowledge of the territory, good marksmanship and to be
constantly under arms. They also maintained public law and order in the area of
their regiment. There were also cavalry sere≈æan units that served as escort to
the high officers of Frontier regiments, carried urgent orders and carried out
special patrol duties. From 1718 to 1739, Military Frontier also included
Habsburg-controlled northern parts of present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina. After
1767, every twelfth inhabitant of the Military Frontier was a soldier, while in
the rest of the Habsburg Monarchy only every 62nd inhabitant was one. The
Frontier soldiers became professional military, ready to move to all European
battlefields. Due to further immigration of refugees from the Ottoman domain,
and the expansion of the territory to places previously controlled by the
Ottomans, the population of the Frontier became even more mixed. There were
still many autochthonous Serbs and Croats in Slavonia and parts of present-day
Vojvodina (in Syrmia, Baƒçka and Banat). However, at this time they became
outnumbered by the Serb, Croat and Vlach refugees/immigrants. Some Germans and
Magyars also came to the Frontier, mostly as administrative personnel, and
there was a number of other settlers and military persons from other parts of
the Habsburg Empire such as the Czechs, Slovaks, Ukrainians, Rusyns and others.
In 1787, the civil administration was separated from the military, but this was
reversed in 1800. By the Basic Law of the Frontier from 1850, the
administration of Military Frontier was split and the land started to look like
a state. The Main Command was headquartered in Zagreb, but still directly
subordinate to the Ministry of War in Vienna. Abolishment of the frontier. The
Croatian Parliament made numerous pleas to demilitarize the Frontier after the
Turkish wars subsided. The demilitarization began in 1869 and on August 8,
1873, under Franz Joseph, the Banatian Frontier was abolished and incorporated
into the Kingdom of Hungary, while part of Croatian Frontier (Kri≈æevci and
ƒêurƒëevac regiments) was incorporated into Croatia-Slavonia. The decree in
which the rest of Croatian and Slavonian Frontiers were incorporated into
Croatian-Slavonian crownland was proclaimed on July 15, 1881, while
incorporation was performed in 1882. Population. 1850-1851. According to the
official Austrian census from 1850-1851, the population of the Military
Frontier numbered 958,877 inhabitants. Divisions. Danube Military Frontier.
This section of the Military Frontier existed in the first half of the 18th
century and comprised parts of southern Baƒçka (including Palanka, Petrovac,
Petrovaradinski ≈ anac, Titel, etc.) and northern Syrmia (including
Petrovaradin, ≈ id, etc.). After the abolishment of this section of the
Frontier, one part of its territory was placed under civil administration and
another part was joined to other sections of the Frontier. Tisa Military
Frontier. This section of the Military Frontier existed between 1702 and 1751
and comprised parts of north-eastern Baƒçka (including Sombor, Subotica,
Kanji≈æa, Senta, Beƒçej, etc.). After the abolishment of this section of the
Frontier, most of its territory was placed under civil administration, while
one small area in the south remained under military administration as part of
the ≈ ajka≈° Battalion. Mure≈ü Military Frontier. This section of the Military
Frontier existed between 1702 and 1751 and comprised the region of Pomori≈°je
(area on the northern bank of the river Mure≈ü). After the abolishment of this
section of the Frontier, its entire territory was placed under civil
administration. Sava Military Frontier. It existed in the first half of the
18th century along the Sava river. Banat Military Frontier. The Banat Krajina
was located on the Serbian-Romanian border. It was divided into Serbian
("Illyrian"), German ("Volksdeutscher") and Romanian ("Vlach") sections.
Slavonian Military Frontier. The Slavonian Krajina was located along Posavina,
from eastern Croatia, following the river Sava, along the border with Bosnia-
Herzegovina and Serbia, and stretched into Syrmia, until inflow into Danube
near Zemun (today part of Belgrade). Its north-eastern border followed the
Danube up until the Petrovaradin. Croatian Military Frontier. The Croatian
Military Frontier or "Banska krajina" was located on the border of Croatia and
Bosnia. This part of the Military Frontier included the geographic regions of
Lika, Kordun, Banovina (named after "Banska krajina"), and bordered the
Adriatic Sea to the west, Venetian Republic to the south, Habsburg Croatia to
the west, and the Ottoman Empire to the east. It extended onto the Slavonian
Krajina near the confluence of the rivers Una and Sava. ≈ ajka≈° Battalion. The
≈ ajka≈° Battalion was a small part of the Frontier that was formed in 1763
from parts of the previously abolished Danube and Tisa sections of the
frontier. In 1852, ≈ ajka≈° battalion was transformed into Titel infantry
battalion. It was abolished in 1873, and its territory was incorporated into
Baƒçka-Bodrog County. Transylvanian Military Frontier. Transylvanian Military
Frontier existed from 1762 to 1851, mostly in eastern and southern parts of
Transylvania. It was composed of two Sz√©kely and two Romanian regiments. The
establishment of the frontier was followed by the "M√°d√©falva Massacre" or
Siculicidium. Legacy. After the former Yugoslav Republic of Croatia declared
independence (in 1991), the Serbs who lived in the region of former Military
Frontier (Vojna Krajina) adopted that name (Krajina) in the name of the
"Republic of Serbian Krajina". However, this Serb entity also included some
territories that were not part of the Military Frontier in the past, while
large tracts of territory that had constituted the Military Frontier resided
outside the Serb region as largely Croat populated areas of the Republic of
Croatia (See the Croatian War of Independence for more information).
