History of Croatia Croatia first appeared as a duchy in the 7th century and
then as a kingdom in the 10th century. From the 12th century it remained a
distinct state with its ruler ("ban") and parliament, but it obeyed the kings
and emperors of various neighboring powers, primarily Hungary and Austria. The
period from the 15th to the 17th centuries was marked by bitter struggles with
the Ottoman Empire. After being incorporated in Yugoslavia for most of the 20th
century, Croatia regained independence in 1991. Prehistoric Croatia. The area
known today as Croatia today was inhabited throughout the prehistoric period.
Fossils of Neanderthals dating to the middle Palaeolithic period have been
unearthed in northern Croatia, with the most famous and the best presented site
in Krapina. Remnants of several Neolithic and Chalcolithic cultures were found
in all regions of the country. The largest proportion of the sites is in the
northern Croatia river valleys, and the most significant cultures whose
presence was discovered include Starƒçevo, Vuƒçedol and Baden cultures. The
Iron Age left traces of the early Illyrian Hallstatt culture and the Celtic La
T√®ne culture. Much later, the region was settled by Liburnians and Illyrians,
while the first Greek colonies were established on the Vis and Hvar islands.
Roman provinces of Pannonia and Dalmatia. Dalmatia was the northern part of the
Illyrian kingdom between the 4th century BC until the Illyrian Wars in the 220s
BC and 168 BC when the Roman Republic established its protectorate south of the
river Neretva. Area north of the Neretva was slowly incorporated into Roman
possessions until the province of Illyricum was formally established c. 32-27
BC. Dalmatia region then became part of the Roman province of Illyricum.
Between 6 and 9 AD the Dalmatians raised the last in a series of revolts
together with the Pannonians, but it was finally crushed and in 10 AD Illyricum
was split into two provinces, Pannonia and Dalmatia. The province of Dalmatia
spread inland to cover all of the Dinaric Alps and most of the eastern Adriatic
coast. Dalmatia was the birthplace of the Roman Emperor Diocletian, who, upon
retirement from Emperor in AD 305, built a large palace near Salona, out of
which the city of Split later developed. Historians such as Theodore Mommsen
and Bernard Bavant aruge that all Dalmatia was fully romanized and Latin
speaking by the 4th century. Others, such as Aleksandar Stipƒçeviƒá, aruge that
that the process of romanization was rather selective and involved mostly urban
centers but not the countryside, where previous Illyrian socio-political
structures weere adapted to Roman administration and political structure only
in some necessities. After the Western Roman Empire collapsed in 476, with the
beginning of the Migration Period, Julius Nepos shortly ruled his diminished
domain from the Diocletian palace after his 476 flight from Italy. The region
was then ruled by the Ostrogoths up to 535, when Justinian I added the
territory to the Byzantine Empire. Later, the Byzantines formed the Theme of
Dalmatia in the same territory. The Roman period ends with Avar and Croat
invasions in the VI-VII century and the destruction of almost all Roman towns.
Roman survivors retreated to more favourable sites on the coast, islands and
mountains. The city of Ragusa was founded by such survivors from Epidaurum.
Medieval Croatian states (until 925). According to the work "De Administrando
Imperio" written by the 10th-century Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII, the
Croats had arrived in what is today Croatia in the early 7th¬ century, however
that claim is disputed and competing hypotheses date the event between the 6th
and the 9th centuries. Eventually two dukedoms were formed‚ÄîDuchy of Pannonia
and Duchy of Dalmatia, ruled by Ljudevit Posavski and Borna, as attested by
chronicles of Einhard starting in the year 818. The record represents the first
document of Croatian realms, vassal states of Francia at the time. The Frankish
overlordship ended during the reign of Mislav two decades later. According to
the Constantine VII christianization of Croats began in the 7th century, but
the claim is disputed and generally christianization is associated with the 9th
century. The first native Croatian ruler recognised by the Pope was duke
Branimir, whom Pope John VIII referred to as "Dux Croatorum" ("Duke of Croats")
in 879. Kingdom of Croatia (925‚Äì1102). Tomislav was the first ruler of
Croatia who was styled a king in a letter from the Pope John X, dating kingdom
of Croatia to year 925. Tomislav defeated Hungarian and Bulgarian invasions,
spreading the influence of Croatian kings. The medieval Croatian kingdom
reached its peak in the 11th century during the reigns of Petar Kre≈°imir IV
(1058‚Äì1074) and Dmitar Zvonimir (1075‚Äì1089). When Stjepan II died in 1091
ending the Trpimiroviƒá dynasty, Ladislaus I of Hungary claimed Croatian crown.
Opposition to the claim led to a war and personal union of Croatia and Hungary
in 1102, ruled by Coloman. Personal union with Hungary (1102‚Äì1527). The
consequences of the change to the Hungarian king included the introduction of
feudalism and the rise of the native noble families such as Frankopan and
≈ ubiƒá. The later kings sought to restore some of their previously lost
influence by giving certain privileges to the towns. For the next four
centuries, the Kingdom of Croatia was ruled by the Sabor (parliament) and a Ban
(viceroy) appointed by the king. The princes of Bribir from the ≈ ubiƒá family
became particularly influential, asserting control over large parts of
Dalmatia, Slavonia and Bosnia. Later, however, the Angevins intervened and
restored royal power. The period saw rise of native nobility such as the
Frankopans and the ≈ ubiƒás to prominence and ultimately numerous Bans from the
two families. Separate coronation as King of Croatia was gradually allowed to
fall into abeyance and last crowned king is Charles Robert in 1301 after which
Croatia contented herself with a separate diploma inaugurale. The reign of
Louis the Great (1342‚Äì1382) is considered the golden age of Croatian medieval
history. Ladislaus of Naples also sold the whole of Dalmatia to Venice in 1409.
The period saw increasing threat of Ottoman conquest and struggle against the
Republic of Venice for control of coastal areas. The Venetians gained control
over most of Dalmatia by 1428, with exception of the city-state of Dubrovnik
which became independent. In 1490 the estates of Croatia declined to recognize
Vladislaus II until he had taken oath to respect their liberties, and insisted
upon his erasing from the diploma certain phrases which seemed to reduce
Croatia to the rank of a mere province. The dispute was solved in 1492 Croatia
in Habsburg Monarchy (1527‚Äì1918). As the Turkish incursion into Europe
started, Croatia once again became a border area. The Croats fought an
increasing number of battles and gradually lost increasing swaths of territory
to the Ottoman Empire. Ottoman conquests led to the 1493 Battle of Krbava field
and 1526 Battle of Moh√°cs, both ending in decisive Ottoman victories. King
Louis II died at Moh√°cs, and in 1527, and the Hungarian parliament elected
J√°nos Szapolyai as the new king of Hungary. Another Hungarian parliament
elected Ferdinand Habsburg as King of Hungary. On the other side, the
Parliament on Cetin chose Ferdinand I of the House of Habsburg as new ruler of
Croatia, under the condition that he provide protection to Croatia against the
Ottoman Empire while respecting its political rights. A few years later both
crown would be again united in Habsburgs hands and the union would be restored.
The Ottoman Empire further expanded in the 16th century to include most of
Slavonia, western Bosnia and Lika. Later in the same century, Croatia was so
weak that its parliament authorized Ferdinand Habsburg to carve out large areas
of Croatia and Slavonia adjacent to the Ottoman Empire for the creation of the
Military Frontier ("Vojna Krajina", "German" Militaergrenze) which would be
ruled directly from Vienna's military headquarters. The area became rather
deserted and was subsequently settled by Serbs, Vlachs, Croats and Germans and
others. As a result of their compulsory military service to the Habsburg Empire
during conflict with the Ottoman Empire, the population in the Military
Frontier was free of serfdom and enjoyed much political autonomy, unlike the
population living in the parts ruled by Hungary. After the Bihaƒá fort finally
fell in 1592, only small parts of Croatia remained unconquered. The Ottoman
army was successfully repelled for the first time on the territory of Croatia
following the battle of Sisak in 1593. The lost territory was mostly restored,
except for large parts of today's Bosnia and Herzegovina. By the 18th century,
the Ottoman Empire was driven out of Hungary, and Austria brought the empire
under central control. Empress Maria Theresa of Austria was supported by the
Croatians in the War of Austrian Succession of 1741‚Äì1748 and subsequently
made significant contributions to Croatian matters. With the fall of the
Venetian Republic in 1797, its possessions in eastern Adriatic became subject
to a dispute between France and Austria. The Habsburgs eventually secured them
(by 1815) and Dalmatia and Istria became part of the empire, though they were
in Cisleithania while Croatia and Slavonia were under Hungary. Croatian
romantic nationalism emerged in mid-19th century to counteract the apparent
Germanization and Magyarization of Croatia. The Illyrian movement attracted a
number of influential figures from 1830s on, and produced some important
advances in the Croatian language and culture. In the Revolutions of 1848
Croatia, driven by fear of Magyar nationalism, supported the Habsburg court
against Hungarian revolutionary forces. However, despite the contributions of
its ban Jelaƒçiƒá in quenching the Hungarian war of independence, Croatia, not
treated any more favourably by Vienna than the Hungarians themselves, lost its
domestic autonomy. In 1867 the Dual Monarchy was created; Croatian autonomy was
restored in 1868 with the Croatian‚ÄìHungarian Settlement which was
comparatively favourable for the Croatians, but still problematic because of
issues such as the unresolved status of Rijeka. Kingdom of Yugoslavia
(1918‚Äì1941). Shortly before the end of the First World War in 1918, the
Croatian Parliament severed relations with Austria-Hungary as the Entente
armies defeated those of the Habsburgs. "Croatia and Slavonia" became a part of
the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs composed out of all Southern Slavic
territories of the now former Austro-Hungarian Monarchy with a transitional
government headed in Zagreb. Although the state inherited much of Austro-
Hungary's military arsenal, including the entire fleet, the Kingdom of Italy
moved rapidly to annex the state's most western territories, promised to her by
the Treaty of London of 1915. An Italian Army eventually took Istria, started
to annex the Adriatic islands one by one, and even landed in Zadar. After
Srijem left "Croatia and Slavonia" and joined Serbia together with Vojvodina,
which was shortly followed by a referendum to join Bosnia and Herzegovina to
Serbia, the People's Council ("Narodno vijeƒáe") of the state, guided by what
was by that time a half a century long tradition of pan-Slavism and without
sanction of the Croatian sabor, joined the Kingdom of Serbia into the Kingdom
of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. The territory of Croatia largely comprised
the territories of the Sava and Littoral Banates. The Kingdom underwent a
crucial change in 1921 to the dismay of Croatia's largest political party, the
Croatian Peasant Party (Hrvatska seljaƒçka stranka). The new constitution
abolished the historical/political entities, including Croatia and Slavonia,
centralizing authority in the capital of Belgrade. The Croatian Peasant Party
boycotted the government of the Serbian People's Radical Party throughout the
period, except for a brief interlude between 1925 and 1927, when external
Italian expansionism was at hand with her allies, Albania, Hungary, Romania and
Bulgaria that threatened Yugoslavia as a whole. In the early 1920s the Yugoslav
government of Serbian prime minister Nikola Pasic used police pressure over
voters and ethnic minorities, confiscation of opposition pamphlets and other
measures of election rigging to keep the opposition, and mainly the Croatian
Peasant Party and its allies in minority in Yugoslav parliament. Pasic believed
that Yugoslavia should be as centralized as possible, creating in place of
distinct regional governments and identities a Greater Serbian national concept
of concentrated power in the hands of Belgrade. During a Parliament session in
1928, the Croatian Peasant Party's leader Stjepan Radiƒá was mortally wounded
by Puni≈°a Raƒçiƒá, a deputy of the Serbian Radical People's Party, which
caused further upsets among the Croatian elite. In 1929, King Aleksandar
proclaimed a dictatorship and imposed a new constitution which, among other
things, renamed the country the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Political parties were
banned from the start and the royal dictatorship took on an increasingly harsh
character. Vladko Maƒçek, who had succeeded Radiƒá as leader of the Croatian
Peasant Party, the largest political party in Croatia, was imprisoned, and
members of a newly emerging insurgent movement, the Usta≈°e, went into exile.
According to the British historian Misha Glenny the murder in March 1929 of
Toni Schlegel, editor of a pro-Yugoslavian newspaper "Novosti", brought a
"furious response" from the regime. In Lika and west Herzegovina in particular,
which he described as "hotbeds of Croatian separatism," he wrote that the
majority-Serb police acted "with no restraining authority whatsoever." And in
the words of a prominent Croatian writer, Shlegel's death became the pretext
for terror in all forms. Politics was soon "indistinguishable from
gangsterism." Even in this oppressive climate, few rallied to the Usta≈°a cause
and the movement was never able to organise within Croatia. But its leaders did
manage to convince the Communist Party that it was a progressive movement. The
party's newspaper "Proleter" (December 1932) stated: " salute the Usta≈°a
movement of the peasants of Lika and Dalmatia and fully support them." In 1934,
King Aleksandar was assassinated abroad, in Marseille, by a coalition of the
Usta≈°e and a similarly radical movement, the Macedonian pro-Bulgarian VMORO.
The Serbian-Croatian Cvetkoviƒá-Maƒçek government that came to power, distanced
Yugoslavia's former allies of France and the United Kingdom, and moved closer
to Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany in the period of 1935‚Äì1941. A national
Banovina of Croatia was created in 1939 out of the two Banates, as well as
parts of the Zeta, Vrbas, Drina and Danube Banates. It had a reconstructed
Croatian Parliament which would choose a Croatian Ban and Viceban. This Croatia
included a part of Bosnia (region), most of Herzegovina and the city of
Dubrovnik and the surroundings. World War II (1941‚Äì1945). The Axis occupation
of Yugoslavia in 1941 allowed the Croatian radical right Usta≈°e to come into
power, forming the "Independent State of Croatia", led by Ante Paveliƒá, who
assumed the role of "Poglavnik" ("Head-man") "Nezavisne Drzave Hrvatske"
("Leader of the Independent State of Croatia"). Following the pattern of other
fascist regimes in Europe, the Ustashi enacted racial laws, formed eight
concentration camps targeting minority Serbs, Romas and Jewish populations, as
well as Croatian partisans. The biggest concentration camp was Jasenovac in
Croatia. The NDH had a program, formulated by Mile Budak, to purge Croatia of
Serbs, by "killing one third, expelling the other third and assimilating the
remaining third". The main targets for persecution, however, were the Serbs,
approximately 330,000 of Serbs were killed. The anti-fascist communist-led
Partisan movement, based on pan-Yugoslav ideology, emerged in early 1941, under
the command of Croatian-born Josip Broz Tito, spreading quickly into many parts
of Yugoslavia. The 1st Sisak Partisan Detachment, often hailed as the first
armed anti-fascist resistance unit in occupied Europe, was formed in Croatia,
in the Brezovica forest near the town of Sisak. As the movement began to gain
popularity, the Partisans gained strength from Croats, Bosniaks, Serbs,
Slovenes, and Macedonians who believed in a unified, but federal, Yugoslav
state. By 1943, the Partisan resistance movement had gained the upper hand,
against the odds, and in 1945, with help from the Soviet Red Army (passing only
through small parts such as Vojvodina), expelled the Axis forces and local
supporters. The "ZAVNOH", state anti-fascist council of people's liberation of
Croatia, functioned since 1944 and formed an interim civil government. NDH's
ministers of War and Internal Security Mladen Lorkoviƒá and Ante Vokiƒá tried
to switch to Allied side. Paveliƒá was in the beginning supporting them but
when he found that he would need to leave his position he imprisoned them in
Lepoglava prison where they were executed. Following the defeat of the
Independent State of Croatia at the end of the war, a large number of Usta≈°e,
and civilians supporting them (ranging from sympathisers, young conscripts,
anti-communists, and ordinary serfs who were allegedly motivated by Partisan
crimes) attempted to flee in the direction of Austria hoping to surrender to
British forces and to be given refuge. They were instead interned by British
forces and then returned to the Partisans. A large number of these persons were
killed in what has come to be called the Bleiburg tragedy. Communist Yugoslavia
(1945‚Äì1991). Tito's leadership of the LCY (1945‚Äì1980). Croatia was a
Socialist Republic part of a six-part Socialist Federative Republic of
Yugoslavia. Under the new communist system, privately owned factories and
estates were nationalized, and the economy was based on a type of planned
market socialism. The country underwent a rebuilding process, recovered from
World War II, went through industrialization and started developing tourism.
The country's socialist system also provided free apartments from big
companies, which with the workers' self-management investments paid for the
living spaces. From 1963, the citizens of Yugoslavia were allowed to travel to
almost any country because of the neutral politics. No visas were required to
travel to eastern or western countries, capitalist or communist nations. Such
free travel was unheard of at the time in the Eastern Bloc countries, and in
some western countries as well (e.g. Spain or Portugal, both dictatorships at
the time). This proved to be very helpful for Croatia's inhabitants who found
working in foreign countries more financially rewarding. Upon retirement, a
popular plan was to return to live in Croatia (then Yugoslavia) to buy a more
expensive property. In Yugoslavia, the people of Croatia were guaranteed free
healthcare, free dental care, and secure pensions. The older generation found
this very comforting as pensions would sometimes exceed their former paychecks.
Free trade and travel within the country also helped Croatian industries that
imported and exported throughout all the former republics. Students and
military personnel were encouraged to visit other republics to learn more about
the country, and all levels of education, especially secondary education and
higher education, were gratis. In reality the housing was inferior with poor
heat and plumbing, the medical care often lacking even in availability of
antibiotics, schools were propaganda machines and travel was a necessity to
provide the country with hard currency. The propagandists who want people to
believe "neutral policies" equalized Serbs and Croats severely restricted free
speech and did not protect citizens from ethnic attacks. Membership in the
party was as much a prerequisite for admission to colleges and for government
jobs as in the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin or Nikita Krushchev. Private
sector businesses did not grow as the taxes on private enterprise were often
prohibitive. Inexperienced management sometimes ruled policy and controlled
decisions by brute force. Strikes were forbidden, Owner/Managers were not
permitted to make changes in decisions which would impact their productivity or
profit. The economy developed into a type of socialism called "samoupravljanje"
(self-management), in which workers controlled socially-owned enterprises. This
kind of market socialism created significantly better economic conditions than
in the Eastern Bloc countries. Croatia went through intensive industrialization
in the 1960s and 1970s with industrial output increasing several-fold and with
Zagreb surpassing Belgrade for the amount of industry. Factories and other
organizations were often named after Partisans who were declared national
heroes. This practice also spread to street names, names of parks and buildings
and some more trivial features. Before World War II, Croatia's industry was not
significant, with the vast majority of the people employed in agriculture. By
1991 the country was completely transformed into a modern industrialized state.
By the same time, the Croatian Adriatic coast had taken shape as an
internationally popular tourist destination, all coastal republics (but mostly
SR Croatia) profited greatly from this, as tourist numbers reached levels still
unsurpassed in modern Croatia. The government brought unprecedented economic
and industrial growth, high levels of social security and a very low crime
rate. The country completely recovered from WW2 and achieved a very high GDP
and economic growth rate, significantly higher than the present-day Republic.
The constitution of 1963 balanced the power in the country between the Croats
and the Serbs, and alleviated the fact that the Croats were again in a
minority. Trends after 1965 (like the fall of OZNA and UDBA chief Aleksandar
Rankoviƒá from power in 1966), however, led to the Croatian Spring of
1970‚Äì71, when students in Zagreb organized demonstrations for greater civil
liberties and greater Croatian autonomy. The regime stifled the public protest
and incarcerated the leaders, but this led to the ratification of a new
Constitution in 1974, giving more rights to the individual republics. At that
time, radical Usta≈°e cells of Croatian √©migr√©s in Western Europe planned and
guerilla acts inside Yugoslavia, but they were largely countered. Until the
break up of Yugoslavia (1980‚Äì1991). In 1980, after Tito's death, economic,
political, and religious difficulties started to mount and the federal
government began to crumble. The crisis in Kosovo and, in 1986, the emergence
of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá in Serbia provoked a very negative reaction in Croatia
and Slovenia; politicians from both republics feared that his motives would
threaten their republics' autonomy. With the climate of change throughout
Eastern Europe during the 1980s, the communist hegemony was challenged (at the
same time, the Milo≈°eviƒá government began to gradually concentrate Yugoslav
power in Serbia and calls for free multi-party elections were becoming louder.
In June 1989 the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) was founded by Croatian
nationalist dissidents led by Franjo Tuƒëman a former fighter in Tito's
Partisan movement and JNA General. At this time Yugoslavia was still a one-
party state and open manifestations of Croatian nationalism were dangerous so
new party was founded in an almost conspiratorial manner. It was only on 13
December 1989 that the governing League of Communists of Croatia agreed to
legalize opposition political parties and hold free elections in the spring of
1990. On 23 January 1990 at its 14th Congress the Communist League of
Yugoslavia voted to remove its monopoly on political power, but the same day
effectively ceased to exist as a national party when the League of Communists
of Slovenia walked out after Serbia's Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá blocked all their
reformist proposals ‚Äì the League of Communists of Croatia walked out soon
after. Independence. Political changes. On 22 April and 7 May 1990, the first
free multi-party elections were held in Croatia. Franjo Tuƒëman's Croatian
Democratic Union (HDZ) won by a relatively slim margin against Ivica Raƒçan's
reformed communist Party of Democratic Change (SDP). However, Croatia's first-
past-the-post election system enabled Tuƒëman to form the government relatively
independently. The HDZ's intentions were to secure independence for Croatia,
contrary to the wishes of a part of the ethnic Serbs in the republic, and
federal and national politicians in Belgrade. The excessively polarized climate
soon escalated into complete estrangement between the two nations and spiralled
into sectarian violence. On 25 July 1990, a Serbian Assembly was established in
Srb, north of Knin, as the political representation of the Serbian people in
Croatia. The Serbian Assembly declared "sovereignty and autonomy of the Serb
people in Croatia". Their position was that if Croatia could secede from
Yugoslavia, then the Serbs could secede from Croatia. Milan Babiƒá, a dentist
from the southern town of Knin, was elected president. The rebel Croatian Serbs
established a number of paramilitary militias under the leadership of Milan
Martiƒá, the police chief in Knin. On 17 August 1990, the Serbs began what
became known as the Log Revolution, where barricades of logs were placed across
roads throughout the South as an expression of their secession from Croatia.
This effectively cut Croatia in two, separating the coastal region of Dalmatia
from the rest of the country. The Croatian government responded to the blockade
of roads by sending special police teams in helicopters to the scene, but they
were intercepted by SFR Yugoslav Air Force fighter jets and forced to turn back
to Zagreb. The Croatian constitution was passed in December 1990 categorizing
Serbs as a minority group along with other ethnic groups. Babiƒá's
administration announced the creation of a Serbian Autonomous Oblast of Krajina
(or "SAO Krajina") on 21 December 1990. Other Serb-dominated communities in
eastern Croatia announced that they would also join SAO Krajina and ceased
paying taxes to the Zagreb government. On Easter Sunday, 31 March 1991, the
first fatal clashes occurred when Croatian police from the Croatian Ministry of
the Interior (MUP) entered the Plitvice Lakes national park to expel rebel Serb
forces. Serb paramilitaries ambushed a bus carrying Croatian police into the
national park on the road north of Korenica, sparking a day-long gun battle
between the two sides. During the fighting, two people, one Croat and one Serb
policeman, were killed. Twenty other people were injured and twenty-nine
Krajina Serb paramilitaries and policemen were taken prisoner by Croatian
forces. Among the prisoners was Goran Had≈æiƒá, later to become the President
of the Republic of Serbian Krajina. On 2 May 1991 the Croatian parliament voted
to hold a referendum on independence. On 19 May 1991, on an almost 80% turnout,
93.24% voted for independence. Krajina boycotted the referendum. They held
their own referendum a week earlier on 12 May 1991 in the territories they
controlled and voted to remain in Yugoslavia which the Croatian government did
not recognize as valid. On 25 June 1991 the Parliament of Croatia declared
independence from Yugoslavia. Slovenia declared independence from Yugoslavia on
the same day. War of Independence (1991‚Äì1995). The civilian population fled
the areas of armed conflict "en masse": generally speaking, hundreds of
thousands of Croats moved away from the Bosnian and Serbian border areas, while
thousands of Serbs moved towards it. In many places, masses of civilians were
forced out by the Yugoslav National Army (JNA), who consisted mostly of
conscripts from Serbia and Montenegro, and irregulars from Serbia, in what
became known as ethnic cleansing. The border city of Vukovar underwent a three
month siege ‚Äì the Battle of Vukovar ‚Äî during which most of the city was
destroyed and a majority of the population was forced to flee. The city fell to
the Serbian forces on 18 November 1991 and the Vukovar massacre occurred.
Subsequent UN-sponsored cease-fires followed, and the warring parties mostly
entrenched. The Yugoslav People's Army retreated from Croatia into Bosnia and
Herzegovina where a new cycle of tensions were escalating: the Bosnian War was
to start. During 1992 and 1993, Croatia also handled an estimated 700,000
refugees from Bosnia, mainly Bosnian Muslims. Armed conflict in Croatia
remained intermittent and mostly on a small scale until 1995. In early August,
Croatia embarked on Operation Storm. The Croatian attack quickly reconquered
most of the territories from the Republic of Serbian Krajina authorities,
leading to a mass exodus of the Serbian population. An estimated
90,000‚Äì350,000 Serbs fled shortly before, during and after the operation. As
a result of this operation, a few months later the Bosnian war ended with the
negotiation of the Dayton Agreement. A peaceful integration of the remaining
Serbian-controlled territories in eastern Slavonia was completed in 1998 under
UN supervision. The majority of the Serbs who fled from the former Krajina have
not returned due to fears of ethnic violence, discrimination and property
repossession problems, and the Croatian government has yet to achieve the
conditions for full reintegration. According to United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees, around 125,000 ethnic Serbs who fled the 1991‚Äì1995
conflict are registered as having returned to Croatia, of whom around 55,000
remain permanently. Since the end of the war. Croatia became a member of the
Council of Europe in 1996. 1996 and 1997 were a period of post-war recovery and
improving economic conditions. However, in 1998 and 1999 Croatia experienced an
economic depression, causing the unemployment of thousands of citizens. The
remaining part of former "Krajina", areas adjacent to FR Yugoslavia, negotiated
a peaceful reintegration process with the Croatian Government. The so-called
Erdut Agreement made the area a temporary protectorate of the UN Transitional
Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium. The area was
formally re-integrated into Croatia by 1998. Franjo Tuƒëman's government
started to lose popularity as it was criticized (among other things) for its
involvement in suspicious privatization deals of the early 1990s as well as a
partial international isolation. The country experienced a mild recession in
1998 and 1999. Tuƒëman died in 1999 and in the early 2000 parliamentary
elections, the nationalist Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) government was
replaced by a center-left coalition under the Social Democratic Party of
Croatia, with Ivica Raƒçan as prime minister. At the same time, presidential
elections were held which were won by a moderate, Stjepan Mesiƒá. The new
Raƒçan government amended the Constitution, changing the political system from
a presidential system to a parliamentary system, transferring most executive
presidential powers from the president onto the institutions of the Parliament
and the Prime Minister. The new government also started several large building
projects, including state-sponsored housing, more rebuilding efforts to enable
refugee return, and the building of the A1 highway. The country achieved
notable economic growth during these years, while the unemployment rate would
continue to rise until 2001 when it finally started falling. Croatia became a
World Trade Organization (WTO) member in 2000 and started the Accession of
Croatia to the European Union in 2003. In late 2003, new parliamentary
elections were held and a reformed HDZ party won under leadership of Ivo
Sanader, who became prime minister. European accession was delayed by
controversies over the extradition of army generals to the ICTY, including the
runaway Ante Gotovina. Sanader was reelected in the closely contested 2007
parliamentary election. Other complications continued to stall the EU
negotiating process, most notably Slovenia's blockade of Croatia's EU accession
in 2008‚Äì2009. In June 2009, Sanader abruptly resigned his post, and named
Jadranka Kosor in his place. Kosor introduced austerity measures to counter the
economic crisis and launched an anti-corruption campaign aimed at public
officials. In late 2009, Kosor signed an agreement with Borut Pahor, the
premier of Slovenia, that allowed the EU accession to proceed. In the Croatian
presidential election, 2009-2010, Ivo Josipoviƒá, the candidate of the SDP won
a landslide victory. Sanader tried to come back into HDZ in 2010, but was then
ejected, and USKOK soon had him arrested on several corruption charges. , his
trial is ongoing. In 2011, the accession agreement was concluded, giving
Croatia the all-clear to join, with a projected accession date of 1 July 2013.
The Croatian parliamentary election, 2011 was held on 4 December 2011, and the
Kukuriku coalition won.
