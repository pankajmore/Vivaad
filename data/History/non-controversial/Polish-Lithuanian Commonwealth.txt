Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth The Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth (or
Union, after 1791 the Commonwealth of Poland) was a dualistic state of Poland
and Lithuania ruled by a common monarch. It was the largest and one of the most
populous countries of 16th- and 17th-century Europe, with some and a multi-
ethnic population of 11 million at its peak in the early 17th century. It was
established at the Union of Lublin in July 1569 and disappeared as an
independent state after the Third Partition of Poland in 1795. The Union
possessed features unique among contemporary states. Its political system was
characterized by strict checks upon monarchical power. These checks were
enacted by a legislature (Sejm) controlled by the nobility (szlachta). This
idiosyncratic system was a precursor to modern concepts of democracy,
constitutional monarchy, and federation. The two component states of the
Commonwealth were formally equal, yet Poland was the dominant partner in the
union. The Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth was marked by high levels of ethnic
diversity and by relative religious tolerance, guaranteed by the Warsaw
Confederation Act 1573; however, the degree of religious freedom varied over
time. After several decades of prosperity, it entered a period of protracted
political, military and economic decline. Its growing weakness led to its
partitioning among its more powerful neighbors, Austria, Prussia and the
Russian Empire, during the late 18th century. Shortly before its demise, the
Commonwealth adopted a massive reform effort and enacted the Constitution of
May 3, 1791 - the first written constitution in modern European history and the
second in modern world history. Name. The official name of the Commonwealth was
The Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (, , , ). Prior to the
17th century, international treaties and diplomatic texts referred to it by its
Latin name . In the 17th century and later it was usually known as the Most
Serene Republic of Poland (Polish , Latin ). Its inhabitants referred to it in
everyday speech as the "Rzeczpospolita" (, ). Western Europeans often simply
called it Poland, applying the "pars pro toto" synecdoche. The widespread term
'Commonwealth of Both Nations' () was coined in the 20th century. History.
Poland and Lithuania underwent an alternating series of wars and alliances
during the 14th century and early 15th century. Several relatively weak
agreements between the two (the Union of Krak√≥w and Vilna, the Union of Krewo,
the Union of Vilnius and Radom, the Union of Grodno, and the Union of Horod≈Ço)
were struck before the permanent 1569 Union of Lublin. This agreement was one
of the signal achievements of Sigismund II Augustus, last monarch of the
Jagiellon dynasty. Sigismund believed he could preserve his dynasty by adopting
elective monarchy. His death in 1572 was followed by a three-year interregnum
during which adjustments were made to the constitutional system; these
adjustments significantly increased the power of the Polish nobility and
established a truly elective monarchy. The Commonwealth reached its Golden Age
in the early 17th century. Its powerful parliament was dominated by nobles
("Pic. 2") who were reluctant to get involved in the Thirty Years' War; this
neutrality spared the country from the ravages of a political-religious
conflict which devastated most of contemporary Europe. The Commonwealth was
able to hold its own against Sweden, Tsardom of Russia, and vassals of the
Ottoman Empire, and even launched successful expansionist offensives against
its neighbors. In several invasions during the Time of Troubles Commonwealth
troops entered Russia and managed to take Moscow and hold it from September 27,
1610 to November 4, 1612, until driven out after a siege. Commonwealth power
began waning after a series of blows during the following decades. A major
rebellion of Cossacks in the southeastern portion of the Commonwealth (the
Khmelnytskyi Uprising in modern-day Ukraine) began in 1648. It resulted in a
Ukrainian request, under the terms of the Treaty of Pereyaslav, for protection
by the Muscovian Tsar. Muscovian annexation of part of Ukraine gradually
supplanted Polish influence. The other blow to the Commonwealth was a Swedish
invasion in 1655. Supported by troops of Transylvanian duke George II R√°k√≥czi
and Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg, The Deluge was the Swedish royal
response to years of Commonwealth belligerence. In the late 17th century, the
weakened Commonwealth's King John III Sobieski allied himself with Leopold I to
deal crushing defeats to the Ottoman Empire. In 1683, the Battle of Vienna
marked the final turning point in a 250-year struggle between the forces of
Christian Europe and the Islamic Ottoman Empire. For its centuries-long stance
against the Muslim advances, the Commonwealth would gain the name of
"Antemurale Christianitatis" (bulwark of Christianity). During the next 16
years the Great Turkish War would drive the Turks permanently south of the
Danube River, never to threaten central Europe again. By the 18th century,
destabilization of its political system brought Poland to the brink of anarchy.
The Commonwealth was facing many internal problems and was vulnerable to
foreign influences. An outright war between the King and the nobility broke out
in 1715 and Tsar Peter the Great's mediation put him in a position to further
weaken the state. The Russian army was present at the Silent Sejm of 1717,
which limited the armed forces to 24,000 and specified its funding, reaffirmed
the liberum veto, and banished the King's Saxon army; the Tsar was to serve as
guarantor of the agreement. Western Europe's increasing exploitation of
resources in the Americas rendered the Commonwealth's supplies less crucial. In
1768 the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth became a protectorate of the Russian
Empire. Control of Poland was central to Catherine the Great's diplomatic and
military strategies. Attempts at reform, such as the Four-Year Sejm's May
Constitution came too late. The country was partitioned in three stages by the
neighboring Russian Empire, Kingdom of Prussia, and the Habsburg Monarchy. By
1795, the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth had been completely erased from the
map of Europe. Poland and Lithuania would not be re-established as independent
countries until 1918. State organization and politics. Golden Liberty. The
political doctrine of the Commonwealth was: "our state is a republic under the
presidency of the King". Chancellor Jan Zamoyski summed up this doctrine when
he said that "Rex regnat et non gubernat" ("The King reigns but ["lit." 'and']
does not govern"). The Commonwealth had a parliament, the Sejm, as well as a
"Senat" and an elected king ("Pic. 1"). The king was obliged to respect
citizens' rights specified in King Henry's Articles as well as in "Pacta
conventa", negotiated at the time of his election. The monarch's power was
limited, in favor of a sizable noble class. Each new king had to pledge to
uphold the Henrician Articles, which were the basis of Poland's political
system (and included near-unprecedented guarantees of religious tolerance).
Over time, the Henrician Articles were merged with the Pacta Conventa, specific
pledges agreed to by the king-elect. From that point onwards, the king was
effectively a partner with the noble class and was constantly supervised by a
group of senators. The Sejm could veto the king on important matters, including
legislation (the adoption of new laws), foreign affairs, declaration of war,
and taxation (changes of existing taxes or the levying of new ones). The three
regions (see below) of the Commonwealth enjoyed a degree of autonomy. Each
voivodship had its own parliament (sejmik), which exercised serious political
power, including choice of pose≈Ç (deputy) to the national Sejm and charging of
the deputy with specific voting instructions. The Grand Duchy of Lithuania had
its own separate army, treasury and most other official institutions. Golden
Liberty created a state that was unusual for its time, although somewhat
similar political systems existed in the contemporary city-states like the
Republic of Venice. Interestingly, both states were styled "Serenissima
Respublica" or the "Most Serene Republic". At a time when most European
countries were headed toward centralization, absolute monarchy and religious
and dynastic warfare, the Commonwealth experimented with decentralization,
confederation and federation, democracy, religious tolerance, and even
pacifism. The Sejm's usual veto of wars has been described as an example of
democratic peace theory. Shortcomings. The end of the Jagiellon dynasty in
1572after nearly two centuriesdisrupted the fragile equilibrium of the
Commonwealth's government. Power increasingly slipped away from the central
government to the nobility. When presented with periodic opportunities to fill
the throne, the "szlachta" exhibited a preference for foreign candidates who
would not found another strong dynasty. This policy often produced monarchs who
were either totally ineffective or in constant debilitating conflict with the
nobility. Furthermore, aside from notable exceptions such as the able
Transylvanian Stefan Batory (1576‚Äì86), the kings of foreign origin were
inclined to subordinate the interests of the Commonwealth to those of their own
country and ruling house. This was especially visible in the policies and
actions of the first two elected kings from the Swedish House of Vasa, whose
politics brought the Commonwealth into conflict with Sweden, culminating in the
war known as The Deluge (1655), one of the events that mark the end of the
Commonwealth's Golden Age and the beginning of the Commonwealth's decline.
Zebrzydowski's rokosz (1606‚Äì07) marked a substantial increase in the power of
the magnates, and the transformation of "szlachta democracy" into "magnate
oligarchy". The Commonwealth's political system was vulnerable to outside
interference, as Sejm deputies bribed by foreign powers might use their liberum
veto to block attempted reforms. This sapped the Commonwealth and plunged it
into political paralysis and anarchy for over a century, from the mid-17th
century to the end of the 18th, while its neighbors stabilized their internal
affairs and increased their military might. Late reforms. These reforms came
too late, however, as the Commonwealth was immediately invaded from all sides
by its neighbors which were content to leave the Commonwealth alone as a weak
buffer state, but reacted strongly to king Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski's and
other reformers' attempts to strengthen the country. Russia feared the
revolutionary implications of the May 3rd Constitution's political reforms and
the prospect of the Commonwealth regaining its position as a European empire.
Catherine the Great regarded the May constitution as fatal to her influence and
declared the Polish constitution Jacobinical. Grigori Aleksandrovich Potemkin
drafted the act for the Targowica Confederation, referring to the constitution
as the "contagion of democratic ideas". Meanwhile, Prussia and Austria, also
afraid of a strengthened Poland, used it as a pretext for further territorial
expansion. Prussian minister Ewald Friedrich von Hertzberg called the
constitution "a blow to the Prussian monarchy", fearing that strengthened
Poland would once again dominate Prussia. In the end, the May 3rd Constitution
was never fully implemented, and the Commonwealth entirely ceased to exist only
four years after the Constitution's adoption. Economy. The economy of the
Commonwealth was dominated by feudal agriculture based on the plantation system
(serfs). Slavery in Poland was forbidden in the 15th century; in Lithuania,
slavery was formally abolished in 1588. They were replaced by the second
enserfment. Typically a nobleman's landholding comprised a "folwark", a large
farm worked by serfs to produce surpluses for internal and external trade. This
economic arrangement worked well for the ruling classes in the early era of the
Commonwealth, which was one of the most prosperous eras of the grain trade. The
economic strength of Commonwealth grain trade waned from the late 17th century
on. Trade relationships were disrupted by the wars and the Commonwealth proved
unable to improve its transport infrastructure or its agricultural practices.
Serfs in the region were increasingly tempted to flee. The Commonwealth's major
attempts at countering this problem and improving productivity consisted of
increasing serfs' workload and further restricting their freedoms in a process
known as export-led serfdom. Though the urban population of the Commonwealth
was about 20% of the total in the 17th century, which was much lower than in
some West European countries (approximately 50% in the Netherlands and Italy)
the urbanization of the country was of a specific character ("Pic. 7"). The
Commonwealth's preoccupation with agriculture, coupled with the szlachta's
privileged position when compared to the bourgeoisie, resulted in a fairly slow
process of urbanization and thus a rather slow development of industries. While
similar conflicts among social classes may be found all over Europe, nowhere
were the nobility as dominant at the time as in the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian
Commonwealth. There is, however, much debate among historians as to which
processes most affected those developments, since until the wars and crises of
the mid-17th century the cities of the Commonwealth had not markedly lagged in
size and wealth behind their western counterparts. The Commonwealth did have
numerous towns and cities, commonly founded on Magdeburg rights. Some of the
largest trade fairs in the Commonwealth were held at Lublin. See the geography
section, below, for a list of major cities in the Commonwealth (commonly
capitals of voivodships). Poland-Lithuania played a significant role in the
supply of 16th century Western Europe by the export of three sorts of goods,
notably grain (rye), cattle (oxen) and fur. These three articles amounted to
nearly 90% of the country's exports to western markets by overland- and
maritime trade. Although the Commonwealth was Europe's largest grain producer,
the bulk of her grain was consumed domestically. Estimated grain consumption in
the Polish Crown (Poland proper) and Prussia in 1560‚Äì70 was some 113,000 tons
of wheat (or 226,000 "≈Çaszt" ‚Äì a "≈Çaszt", or "last", being a large bulk
measure; in the case of grain, about half a ton). Average yearly production of
grain in the Commonwealth in the 16th Century was 120,000 tons, 6% of which was
exported, while cities consumed some 19% and the remainder was consumed by the
villages. Commonwealth grain achieved far more importance in poor crop years,
as in the early 1590s and the 1620s, when governments throughout southern
Europe arranged for large grain imports to cover shortfalls in their
jurisdictions. Still, grain was the largest export commodity of the
Commonwealth. The owner of a folwark usually signed a contract with merchants
of Gda≈Ñsk, who controlled 80% of this inland trade, to ship the grain north to
that seaport on the Baltic Sea. Many rivers in the Commonwealth were used for
shipping purposes: the Vistula, Pilica, Bug, San, Nida, Wieprz, Neman. The
rivers had relatively developed infrastructure, with river ports and granaries.
Most of the river shipping moved north, southward transport being less
profitable, and barges and rafts were often sold off in Gda≈Ñsk for lumber.
Hrodna become an important site after formation of a customs post at August√≥w
in 1569, which became a checkpoint for merchants travelling to the Crown lands
from the Grand Duchy. From Gda≈Ñsk, ships, mostly from the Netherlands and
Flanders, carried the grain to ports such as Antwerp and Amsterdam. Besides
grain, other seaborne exports included carminic acid from Polish cochineal,
lumber and wood-related products such as ash, and tar. The land routes, mostly
to the German lands of the Holy Roman Empire such as the cities of Leipzig and
Nuremberg, were used for export of live cattle (herds of around 50,000 head)
hides, furs, salt, tobacco, hemp, cotton (mostly from Greater Poland) and
linen. The Commonwealth imported wine, fruit, spices, luxury goods (e.g.
tapestries, "Pic. 5"), clothing, fish, beer and industrial products like steel
and tools. A few riverboats carried south imports from Gda≈Ñsk like wine,
fruit, spices and herring. Somewhere between the 16th and 17th centuries, the
Commonwealth's trade balance shifted from positive to negative. With the advent
of the Age of Discovery, many old trading routes such as the Amber Road ("Pic.
4") lost importance as new ones were created. Poland's importance as a caravan
route between Asia and Europe diminished, while new local trading routes were
created between the Commonwealth and Russia. Many goods and cultural artifacts
continued to pass from one region to another via the Commonwealth. For example,
Isfahan rugs imported from Persia to the Commonwealth were actually known in
the West as "Polish rugs" (). Commonwealth currency included the z≈Çoty and the
grosz. The City of Gda≈Ñsk had the privilege of minting its own coinage.
Culture. Science and literature. The Commonwealth was an important European
center for the development of modern social and political ideas. It was famous
for its rare quasi-democratic political system, praised by philosophers such as
Erasmus; and, during the Counter-Reformation, was known for near-unparalleled
religious tolerance, with peacefully coexisting Catholic, Jewish, Eastern
Orthodox, Protestant and Muslim communities. In the 18th century, the French
Catholic Rulhiere wrote of 16th century Poland: "This country, which in our day
we have seen divided on the pretext of religion, is the first state in Europe
that exemplified tolerance. In this state, mosques arose between churches and
synagogues.‚Äù The Commonwealth gave rise to the famous Christian sect of the
Polish Brethren, antecedents of British and American Unitarianism. With its
political system, the Commonwealth gave birth to political philosophers such as
Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski (1503‚Äì1572) ("Pic. 9"), Wawrzyniec Grzyma≈Ça
Go≈õlicki (1530‚Äì1607) and Piotr Skarga (1536‚Äì1612). Later, works by
Stanis≈Çaw Staszic (1755‚Äì1826) and Hugo Ko≈Ç≈ÇƒÖtaj (1750‚Äì1812) helped pave
the way for the Constitution of May 3, 1791, which Norman Davies calls the
first of its kind in Europe. Krak√≥w's Jagiellonian University is one of the
oldest universities in the world (established in 1364), together with the
Vilnius University (established in 1579) they were the major scholarly and
scientific centers in the Commonwealth. The Komisja Edukacji Narodowej, Polish
for "Commission for National Education", formed in 1773, was the world's first
national Ministry of Education. Commonwealth scientists included: Martin Kromer
(1512‚Äì1589), historian and cartographer; Micha≈Ç Sƒôdziw√≥j (1566‚Äì1636),
alchemist and chemist; Jan Bro≈ºek ("Ioannes Broscius" in Latin) (1585‚Äì1652),
polymath: a mathematician, physician and astronomer; Krzysztof Arciszewski
("Crestofle d'Artischau Arciszewski" in Portuguese) (1592‚Äì1656), engineer,
ethnographer, general and admiral of the Dutch West Indies Company army in the
war with the Spanish Empire for control of Brazil; Kazimierz Siemienowicz
(1600‚Äì1651), military engineer, artillery specialist and a founder of
rocketry; Johannes Hevelius (1611‚Äì1687), astronomer, founder of lunar
topography; Micha≈Ç Boym (1612‚Äì1659), orientalist, cartographer, naturalist
and diplomat in Ming Dynasty's service ("Pic. 11"); Adam Adamandy Kocha≈Ñski
(1631‚Äì1700), mathematician and engineer; Baal Shem Tov (◊î◊ë◊¢◊ú ◊©◊ù ◊ò◊ï◊ë
in Hebrew) (1698‚Äì1760), considered to be the founder of Hasidic Judaism;
Marcin Odlanicki Poczobutt (1728‚Äì1810), astronomer and mathematician ("Pic.
12"); Jan Krzysztof Kluk (1739‚Äì1796), naturalist, agronomist and
entomologist, John Jonston (1603‚Äì1675) scholar and physician, descended from
Scottish nobility. In 1628 the Czech teacher, scientist, educator, and writer
John Amos Comenius took refuge in the Commonwealth, when the Protestants were
persecuted under the Counter Reformation. The works of many Commonwealth
authors are considered classics, including those of Jan Kochanowski ("Pic.
10"), Wac≈Çaw Potocki, Ignacy Krasicki, and Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz. Many
"szlachta" members wrote memoirs and diaries. Perhaps the most famous are the
"Memoirs of Polish History" by Albrycht Stanis≈Çaw Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç (1595‚Äì1656)
and the "Memoirs" of Jan Chryzostom Pasek ("ca." 1636‚Äì"ca." 1701). Jakub
Sobieski (1590‚Äì1646) (father of John III Sobieski) wrote notable diaries.
During the Khotyn expedition in 1621 he wrote a diary called "Commentariorum
chotinensis belli libri tres" (Diary of the Chocim War), which was published in
1646 in Gda≈Ñsk. It was used by Wac≈Çaw Potocki as a basis for his epic poem,
"Transakcja wojny chocimskiej" ("The Progress of the War of Chocim"). He also
authored instructions for the journey of his sons to Krak√≥w (1640) and France
(1645), a good example of liberal education of the era. Art and music. The two
great religious cultures of the Commonwealth, Latin and Eastern Orthodox,
coexisted and penetrated each other, which is reflected in the great popularity
of icons ("Pic. 13") and the icons resembling effigies of Mary, as well as the
metal dresses typical of the Orthodox Church in the predominantly Latin
territories of today's Poland (Black Madonna) and Lithuania (Our Lady of the
Gate of Dawn). The implementation of post-Renaissance naturalism and the
sentimentality of the Polish baroque in Orthodox painting as well as the
creation of the Cossack Baroque style in architecture, also inspired by Polish
patterns, were the major factors of Latin infiltration into Eastern Orthodox
art ("Pic. 3"). A common art form of the Sarmatian period were coffin
portraits, particular to the culture of the Commonwealth, used in funerals and
other important ceremonies. As a rule, such portraits were nailed to sheet
metal, six ‚Äì or eight ‚Äì sided in shape, fixed to the front of a coffin
placed on a high, ornate catafalque. Another characteristic is common usage of
black marble. Altars, fonts, portals, balustrades, columns, monuments,
tombstones, headstones and whole rooms (e.g. Marble Room at the Royal Castle in
Warsaw, St. Casimir Chapel of the Vilnius Cathedral and Vasa Chapel of the
Wawel Cathedral) were decorated with black marble. Music was a common feature
of religious and secular events. To that end many noblemen founded church and
school choirs, and employed their own ensembles of musicians. Some, like
Stanis≈Çaw Lubomirski build their own opera houses (in Nowy Wi≈õnicz). Yet
others, like Janusz Skumin Tyszkiewicz and Krzysztof Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç were known for
their sponsorship of arts which manifested itself in their permanently retained
orchestras, at their courts in Vilnius. Musical life further flourished during
the reign of the Vasas. Both foreign and domestic composers were active in the
Commonwealth. King Sigismund III brought in Italian composers and conductors,
such as Luca Marenzio, Annibale Stabile, Asprilio Pacelli, Marco Scacchi and
Diomedes Cato for the royal orchestra. Notable home grown musicians, who also
composed and played for the King's court, included Bart≈Çomiej Pƒôkiel, Jacek
R√≥≈ºycki, Adam Jarzƒôbski, Marcin Mielczewski, Stanis≈Çaw Sylwester
Szarzy≈Ñski, Damian Stachowicz, Miko≈Çaj Ziele≈Ñski and Grzegorz Gorczycki.
Magnates often undertook construction projects as monuments to themselves:
churches, cathedrals, monasteries ("Pic. 14"), and palaces like the present-day
Presidential Palace in Warsaw and Pidhirtsi Castle built by Grand Hetman
Stanis≈Çaw Koniecpolski "herbu" Pob√≥g. The largest projects involved entire
towns, although in time many of them would lapse into obscurity or be totally
abandoned. Usually they were named after the sponsoring magnate. Among the most
famous is the town of Zamo≈õƒá, founded by Jan Zamoyski and designed by the
Italian architect Bernardo Morando. The magnates throughout Poland competed
with the kings. The monumental castle Krzy≈ºtop√≥r, built in the style "palazzo
in fortezza" between 1627 and 1644, had several courtyards surrounded by
fortifications. Due to efforts of powerful Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç family, the town of
Nesvizh in today's Belarus came to exercise significant influence in many
domains ‚Äì the Nesvizh manufactures of firearm, carpets, kontusz sashes and
tapestries as well as school of painting produced renowned and luxury items.
Late baroque fascination with the culture and art of the "central nation" is
reflected in Queen Masysie≈Ñka's Chinese Palace in Zolochiv. 18th century
magnate palaces represents the characteristic type of baroque suburban
residence built "entre cour et jardin" (between the entrance court and the
garden). Its architecture - a merger of European art with old Commonwealth
building traditions are visible in Wilan√≥w Palace in Warsaw ("Pic. 15"),
Branicki Palace in Bia≈Çystok and in Warsaw, Potocki Palace in Radzy≈Ñ Podlaski
and in Krystynopol, Raczy≈Ñski Palace in Rogalin and Sapieha Palace in Ruzhany.
Szlachta and Sarmatism. The prevalent ideology of the szlachta became
"Sarmatism", named after the Sarmatians, alleged ancestors of the Poles. This
belief system was an important part of the szlachta's culture, penetrating all
aspects of its life. Sarmatism enshrined equality among szlachta, horseback
riding, tradition, provincial rural life, peace and pacifism; championed
oriental-inspired attire (≈ºupan, kontusz, sukmana, pas kontuszowy, delia,
szabla); and served to integrate the multi-ethnic nobility by creating an
almost nationalistic sense of unity and of pride in the szlachta's Golden
Freedoms. In its early, idealistic form, Sarmatism represented a positive
cultural movement: it supported religious belief, honesty, national pride,
courage, equality and freedom. In time, however, it became distorted. Late
extreme Sarmatism turned belief into bigotry, honesty into political na√Øvet√©,
pride into arrogance, courage into stubbornness and freedom into anarchy. The
faults of Sarmatism were blamed for the demise of the country from the late
18th century onwards. Criticism, often one-sided and exaggerated, was used by
the Polish reformists to push for radical changes. This self-deprecation was
accompanied by works of Prussian, Russian and Austrian historians, who tried to
prove that it was Poland itself that was to blame for its fall. Demographics
and religion. The population of the Commonwealth was never overwhelmingly
either Roman Catholic or Polish. This circumstance resulted from Poland's
possession of Ukraine and confederation with Lithuania, in both of which
countries ethnic Poles were a distinct minority. The Commonwealth comprised
primarily four nations: Lithuanians, Poles, Belarusians and Ukrainians; the
latter two usually referred to as the Ruthenians. Sometimes inhabitants of the
Grand Duchy of Lithuania were called Litvins, a Slavic term for people from
Lithuania, regardless their ethnicity (with the exception of Jews, which were
called Litvaks). Shortly after the Union of Lublin ( 1569 ), the Commonwealth
population was around 7 million, with a rough breakdown of 4.5 m Poles, 0.75 m
Lithuanians, 0.7 m/10% Jews and 2 m Ruthenians. In 1618, after the Truce of
Deulino, the Commonwealth population increased together with its territory,
reaching 11.5 million people, which was composed roughly of 4.5 m Poles, 3.5 m
Ukrainians, 1.5 m Belarusians, 0.75 m Lithuanians, 0.75 m Old Prussians, 0.5 m
Jews, and 0.5 m Livonians. At that time nobility was 10% of the population, and
burghers were 15%. The average population density per square kilometer was: 24
in Mazovia, 23 in Little Poland, 19 in Great Poland, 12 in Lublin palatinate,
10 in the Lvov area, 7 in Podolia and Volhynia, 3 in the Ukraine. There was a
tendency for the people from the more densely inhabited western territories to
migrate eastwards. In the period from 1648‚Äì57, populations losses are
estimated at 4 m. Coupled with further population and territorial losses, in
1717 the Commonwealth population had fallen to 9 m, with roughly 4.5 m/50%
Poles, 1.5 m/17% Ukrainians, 1.2 m Belarusians, 0.8 m Lithuanians, 0.5 m Jews,
and 0.5 m others. ‚ÄúCertainly, the wording and substance of the declaration of
the Confederation of Warsaw of 28 January 1573 were extraordinary with regards
to prevailing conditions elsewhere in Europe; and they governed the principles
of religious life in the Republic for over two hundred years.‚Äù - Norman
Davies Poland has a long tradition of religious freedom. The right to worship
freely was a basic right given to all inhabitants of the Commonwealth
throughout the 15th and early 16th century, however, complete freedom of
religion was officially recognized in Poland in 1573 during the Warsaw
Confederation. Poland kept religious freedom laws during an era when religious
persecution was an everyday occurrence in the rest of Europe. Commonwealth was
a place were the most radical religious sects, trying to escape persecution in
other countries of the Christian world, sought refuge. In 1561 Bonifacio
d‚ÄôOria, a religious exile living in Poland, wrote of his adopted country‚Äôs
virtues to a colleague back in Italy: ‚ÄúYou could live here in accordance with
your ideas and preferences, in great, even the greatest freedoms, including
writing and publishing. No one is a censor here." "This country became a place
of shelter for heretics‚Äù - Cardinal Hozjusz papal legate to Poland. To be
"Polish", in the non-Polish lands of the Commonwealth, was then much less an
index of ethnicity than of religion and rank; it was a designation largely
reserved for the landed noble class (szlachta), which included Poles but also
many members of non-Polish origin who converted to Catholicism in increasing
numbers with each following generation. For the non-Polish noble such
conversion meant a final step of Polonization that followed the adoption of the
Polish language and culture. Poland, as the culturally most advanced part of
the Commonwealth, with the royal court, the capital, the largest cities, the
second-oldest university in Central Europe (after Prague), and the more liberal
and democratic social institutions had proven an irresistible magnet for the
non-Polish nobility in the Commonwealth. Many referred to themselves as "gente
Ruthenus, natione Polonus" (Ruthenian by blood, Polish by nationality) since
16th century onwards. As a result, in the eastern territories a Polish (or
Polonized) aristocracy dominated a peasantry whose great majority was neither
Polish nor Roman Catholic. Moreover, the decades of peace brought huge
colonization efforts to Ukraine, heightening the tensions among nobles, Jews,
Cossacks (traditionally Orthodox), Polish and Ruthenian peasants. The latter,
deprived of their native protectors among the Ruthenian nobility, turned for
protection to cossacks that facilitated violence that in the end broke the
Commonwealth. The tensions were aggravated by conflicts between Eastern
Orthodoxy and the Greek Catholic Church following the Union of Brest, overall
discrimination of Orthodox religions by dominant Catholicism, and several
Cossack uprisings. In the west and north, many cities had sizable German
minorities, often belonging to Reformed churches. The Commonwealth had also one
of the largest Jewish diasporas in the world ‚Äì by the mid-16th century 80% of
the world's Jews lived in Poland ("Pic. 16"). Until the Reformation, the
szlachta were mostly Catholic or Eastern Orthodox ("Pic. 3, 13"). However, many
families quickly adopted the Reformed religion. After the Counter-Reformation,
when the Roman Catholic Church regained power in Poland, the szlachta became
almost exclusively Roman Catholic, despite the fact that Roman Catholicism was
not a majority religion (the Roman Catholic and Orthodox churches counted
approximately 40% of the population each, while the remaining 20% were Jews and
members of various Protestant churches). The Crown had about double the
population of Lithuania and five times the income of the latter's treasury. As
with other countries, the borders, area and population of the Commonwealth
varied over time. After the Peace of Jam Zapolski (1582), the Commonwealth had
approximately 815,000¬ km¬≤ area and a population of 7.5 million. After the
Truce of Deulino (1618), the Commonwealth had an area of some 990,000¬ km¬≤ and
a population of 10‚Äì11 million (including some 4 million Poles and close to a
million Lithuanians). Legacy. The Duchy of Warsaw, established in 1807, traced
its origins to the Commonwealth. Other revival movements appeared during the
November Uprising (1830‚Äì31), the January Uprising (1863‚Äì64) and in the
1920s, with J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski's failed attempt to create a Polish-led
"Miƒôdzymorze" ("Between-Seas") federation that would have included Lithuania
and Ukraine. Today's Republic of Poland considers itself a successor to the
Commonwealth, whereas the Republic of Lithuania, re-established at the end of
World War I, saw the participation of the Lithuanian state in the old
Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth mostly in a negative light at the early stages
of regaining its independence, although this attitude has been changing
recently. Administrative division. The Commonwealth was further divided into
smaller administrative units known as voivodships ("wojew√≥dztwa"). Each
voivodship was governed by a voivod ("wojewoda", governor). Voivodships were
further divided into "starostwa", each "starostwo" being governed by a
"starosta". Cities were governed by castellans. There were frequent exceptions
to these rules, often involving the "ziemia" subunit of administration. The
lands that once belonged to the Commonwealth are now largely distributed among
several Central and East European countries: Poland, Ukraine, Moldova
(Transnistria), Belarus, Russia, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. Also some
small towns in Slovakia, then within the Kingdom of Hungary, became a part of
Poland in the Treaty of Lubowla. Commonwealth borders shifted with wars and
treaties, sometimes several times in a decade, especially in the eastern and
southern parts. After the Peace of Jam Zapolski (1582), the Commonwealth had
approximately 815,000¬ km¬≤ area and a population of 7.5 million. After the
Truce of Deulino (1618), the Commonwealth had an area of some 1 million km¬≤
(990,000¬ km¬≤) and a population of about 11 million. Geography. In the 16th
century, the Polish bishop and cartographer Martin Kromer published a Latin
atlas, entitled "Poland: about Its Location, People, Culture, Offices and the
Polish Commonwealth", which was regarded as the most comprehensive guide to the
country. Kromer's works and other contemporary maps, such as those of Gerardus
Mercator, show the Commonwealth as mostly plains. The Commonwealth's
southeastern part, the Kresy, was famous for its steppes. The Carpathian
Mountains formed part of the southern border, with the Tatra Mountain chain the
highest, and the Baltic Sea formed the Commonwealth's northern border. As with
most European countries at the time, the Commonwealth had extensive forest
cover, especially in the east. Today, what remains of the Bia≈Çowie≈ºa Forest
constitutes the last largely intact primeval forest in Europe. Notes. b.
Historians date the change of the Polish capital from Krak√≥w to Warsaw between
1595 and 1611, although Warsaw was not officially designated capital until
1793. The Commonwealth Sejm began meeting in Warsaw soon after the Union of
Lublin and its rulers generally maintained their courts there, although
coronations continued to take place in Krakow. The modern concept of a single
capital city was to some extent inapplicable in the feudal and decentralized
Commonwealth. Warsaw is described by some historians as the capital of the
entire Commonwealth. Vilnius, the capital of the Grand Duchy, is sometimes
called the second capital of the entity.
