History of colonialism The historical phenomenon of colonisation is one that
stretches around the globe and across time, including such disparate peoples as
the Hittites, the Incas and the British. European colonialism, or imperialism,
began in the 15th century with the "Age of Discovery", led by Portuguese and
Spanish exploration of the Americas, and the coasts of Africa, the Middle East,
India, and East Asia. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, England,
France and Holland established their own overseas empires, in direct
competition with each other. The end of the eighteenth and early 19th century
saw the first era of decolonization when most of the European colonies in the
Americas gained their independence from their respective metropoles. Spain and
Portugal were irreversibly weakened after the loss of their New World colonies,
but the Kingdom of Great Britain (after the union of England, Wales, and
Scotland), France and Holland turned their attention to the Old World,
particularly South Africa, India and South East Asia, where coastal enclaves
had already been established. The industrialization of the nineteenth century
led to what has been termed the era of New Imperialism, when the pace of
colonization rapidly accelerated, the height of which was the Scramble for
Africa, in which Belgium was a major and Germany a lesser participant. During
the twentieth century, the overseas colonies of the losers of World War I were
distributed amongst the victors as mandates, but it was not until the end of
World War II that the second phase of decolonization began in earnest. In 1999
Portugal returned the last of Europe's colonies in Asia, Macau, to China,
ending an era that had lasted six hundred years. Portuguese and Spanish
exploration and colonization. European colonisation of both Eastern and Western
Hemispheres has its roots in Portuguese exploration. There were financial and
religious motives behind this exploration. By finding the source of the
lucrative spice trade, the Portuguese could reap its profits for themselves.
They would also be able to probe the existence of the fabled Christian kingdom
of Prester John, with a view to encircling the Islamic Ottoman Empire. The
first foothold outside of Europe was gained with the conquest of Ceuta in 1415.
During the 15th century Portuguese sailors discovered the Atlantic islands of
Madeira, Azores, and Cape Verde, which were duly populated, and pressed
progressively further along the west African coast until Bartolomeu Dias
demonstrated it was possible to sail around Africa by rounding the Cape of Good
Hope in 1488, paving the way for Vasco da Gama to reach India in 1498.
Portuguese successes led to Spanish financing of a mission by Christopher
Columbus in 1492 to explore an alternative route to Asia, by sailing west. When
Columbus eventually made landfall in what are now called the Bahamas he
believed he had reached the coast of Japan, but had in fact "discovered" the
peripheral islands of a new continent, the Americas. After Columbus' return to
Europe, competing Spanish and Portuguese claims to undiscovered lands were
settled in 1494 with the Treaty of Tordesillas, which divided the world outside
of Europe in an exclusive duopoly between the Iberian kingdoms along a north-
south meridian 370 leagues west of Cape Verde. Technically this meant that all
of the Americas were open to Spanish colonization, but when Pedro √Ålvares
Cabral's voyage to India was blown off course and landfall made on the
Brazilian coast, this accident of navigation and an inability at the time to
accurately measure longitude meant that Brazil ended up within the Portuguese
half. The boundaries specified by the Treaty of Tordesillas were put to the
test a second time when Ferdinand Magellan, a Portuguese explorer sailing under
the Spanish flag reached the Philippines in 1521. The two by now global
empires, which had set out from opposing directions, had finally met on the
other side of the world. During the 16th century the Portuguese continued to
press both eastwards and westwards into the Oceans. Towards Asia they made the
first direct contact between Europeans and the peoples inhabiting present day
countries such as Mozambique, Madagascar, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Indonesia, East
Timor (1512), China, and finally Japan). In the opposite direction, the
Portuguese colonized the huge territory that eventually became Brasil, and the
Spanish conquistadores established the vast Viceroyalties of New Spain and
Peru, and later of R√≠o de la Plata (Argentina) and New Granada (Colombia). In
Asia, the Portuguese encountered ancient and well populated societies, and
established a seaborne empire consisting of armed coastal trading posts along
their trade routes (such as Goa, Malacca and Macau), so they had relatively
little cultural impact on the societies they forced their way into trading
with. In the Western Hemisphere, the European colonization involved the
emigration of large numbers of settlers, soldiers and administrators intent on
owning land and exploiting the apparently primitive (as perceived by Old World
standards) indigenous peoples of the Americas. The result was that the
colonization of the New World was catastrophic: native peoples were no match
for European technology, ruthlessness, or their diseases which decimated the
indigenous population. Spanish treatment of the indigenous populations provoked
a fierce debate, the Valladolid Controversy, over whether Indians possessed
souls and if so, whether they were entitled to the basic rights of mankind.
Bartolom√© de Las Casas, author of "A Short Account of the Destruction of the
Indies", championed the cause of the native peoples, and was opposed by
Sep√∫lveda, who claimed Amerindians were "natural slaves". The Roman Catholic
Church played a large role in Spanish and Portuguese overseas activities. The
Dominicans, Jesuits, and Franciscans, notably Francis Xavier in Asia and
Jun√≠pero Serra in North America, were particularly active in this endeavour.
Many buildings erected by the Jesuits still stand, such as the Cathedral of
Saint Paul in Macau and the Santisima Trinidad de Paran√° in Paraguay, the
latter an example of the Jesuit Reductions. The Dominican and Franciscan
buildings of California's missions and New Mexico's missions stand restored,
such as Mission Santa Barbara in Santa Barbara, California and San Francisco de
Asis Mission Church in Ranchos de Taos, New Mexico. As characteristically
happens in any colonialism, European or not, previous or subsequent, both Spain
and Portugal profited handsomely from their new found overseas colonies: the
Spanish from gold and silver from mines such as Potos√≠ and Zacateca in New
Spain, the Portuguese from the huge markups they enjoyed as trade
intermediaries, particarlarly during the Namban Japan trade period. The influx
of precious metals to the Spanish monarchy's coffers allowed it to finance
costly religious wars in Europe which ultimately proved its undoing: the supply
of metals was not infinite and the large inflow caused inflation and debt.
Northern European challenges to the Iberian hegemony. It was not long before
the exclusivity of Iberian claims to the Americas was challenged by other up
and coming European powers, primarily the Netherlands, France and England: the
view taken by the rulers of these nations is epitomized by the quotation
attributed to Francis I of France demanding to be shown the clause in Adam's
will excluding his authority from the New World. This challenge initially took
the form of piratical attacks (such as those by Francis Drake) on Spanish
treasure fleets or coastal settlements, but later the Northern European
countries began establishing settlements of their own, primarily in areas that
were outside of Spanish interests, such as what is now the eastern seaboard of
the U.S. and Canada, or islands in the Caribbean, such as Aruba, Martinique and
Barbados, that had been abandoned by the Spanish in favour of the mainland and
larger islands. Whereas Spanish colonialism was based on the religious
conversion and exploitation of local populations via encomiendas (many
Spaniards emigrated to the Americas to elevate their social status, and were
not interested in manual labour), Northern European colonialism was bolstered
by those emigrating for religious reasons (for example, the Mayflower voyage).
The motive for emigration was not to become an aristocrat or to spread one's
faith but to start a new society afresh, structured according to the colonists
wishes. The most populous emigration of the seventeenth century was that of the
English, who after a series of wars with the Dutch and French came to dominate
the eastern coast of the present day U.S. and Canada. However, the English,
French and Dutch were no more averse to making a profit than the Spanish and
Portuguese, and whilst their areas of settlement in the Americas proved to be
devoid of the precious metals found by the Spanish, trade in other commodities
and products that could be sold at massive profit in Europe provided another
reason for crossing the Atlantic, in particular furs from Canada, tobacco and
cotton grown in Virginia and sugar in the islands of the Caribbean and Brazil.
Due to the massive depletion of indigenous labour, plantation owners had to
look elsewhere for manpower for these labour-intensive crops. They turned to
the centuries old slave trade of west Africa and began transporting Africans
across the Atlantic on a massive scale ‚Äì historians estimate that the
Atlantic slave trade brought between 10 and 12 million African (mostly black
skinned) slaves to the New World. The islands of the Caribbean soon came to be
populated by slaves of African descent, ruled over by a white minority of
plantation owners interested in making a fortune and then returning to their
home country to spend it. Role of companies in early colonialism. From its very
outset, Western colonialism was operated as a joint public-private venture.
Columbus' voyages to the Americas were partially funded by Italian investors,
but whereas the Spanish state maintained a tight reign on trade with its
colonies (by law, the colonies could only trade with one designated port in the
mother country and treasure was brought back in special convoys), the English,
French and Dutch granted what were effectively trade monopolies to joint-stock
companies such as the East India Companies and the Hudson's Bay Company.
Imperial Russia had no State sponsored expeditions or colonization in the
Americas, but did charter the first Russian joint-stock commercial enterprise,
the Russian America Company, which did sponsor those activities in its
territories. European colonies in India. In May 1498, the Portuguese set foot
in Kozhikode in Kerala. Rivalry among reigning European powers saw the entry of
the Dutch, English, French, Danish and others. The kingdoms of India were
gradually taken over by the Europeans and indirectly controlled by puppet
rulers. In 1600, Queen Elizabeth I accorded a charter, forming the East India
Company to trade with India and eastern Asia. The English landed in India in
Surat in 1612. By the nineteenth century, they had assumed direct and indirect
control over most of India. Independence in the Americas (1770‚Äì1820). During
the five decades following 1770, Britain, France, Spain and Portugal lost many
of their possessions in the Americas. Britain and the Thirteen Colonies. After
the conclusion of the Seven Years' War in 1763, Britain had emerged as the
world's dominant power, but found itself mired in debt and struggling to
finance the Navy and Army necessary to maintain a global empire. The British
Parliament's attempt to raise taxes from North American colonists raised fears
among the Americans that their rights as "Englishmen", and particularly their
rights of self-government, were in danger. A series of disputes with Parliament
over taxation led first to informal committees of correspondence among the
colonies, then to coordinated protest and resistance. A standing army was
formed by the United Colonies, and independence was declared by the Second
Continental Congress on 4 July 1776. The American War of Independence continued
until 1783, when the Treaty of Paris was signed. Britain recognised the
sovereignty of the United States over the territory bounded by the British
possessions to the North, Florida to the South, and the Mississippi River to
the west. France and the Haitian Revolution (1791‚Äì1804). The Ha√Øtian
Revolution, a slave revolt led by Toussaint L'Ouverture in the French colony of
Saint-Domingue, established Ha√Øti as a free, black republic, the first of its
kind. Haiti became the second independent nation that was a former European
colony in the Western Hemisphere after the United States. Africans and people
of African ancestry freed themselves from slavery and colonization by taking
advantage of the conflict among whites over how to implement the reforms of the
French Revolution in this slave society. Although independence was declared in
1804, it was not until 1825 that it was formally recognized by King Charles X
of France. Spain and the Wars of Independence in Latin America. The gradual
decline of Spain as an imperial power throughout the 17th century was hastened
by the War of the Spanish Succession (1701‚Äì14), as a result of which it lost
its European imperial possessions. The death knell for the Spanish Empire in
the Americas was Napoleon's invasion of the Iberian peninsula in 1808. With the
installation of his brother Joseph on the Spanish throne, the main tie between
the metropole and its American colonies, the Spanish monarchy, had been cut,
leading the colonists to question their continued subordination to a declining
and distant country. With an eye on the events of the American Revolution forty
years earlier, revolutionary leaders began bloody wars of independence against
Spain, whose armies were ultimately unable to maintain control. By 1831, Spain
had been ejected from the mainland of the American continent, leaving a
collection of independent republics that stretched from Chile and Argentina in
the south to Mexico in the north. Spain's colonial possessions were reduced to
Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Philippines and a number of small islands in the
Pacific, all of which she was to lose to the United States in the 1889 Spanish-
American War or sell to Germany shortly thereafter. Portugal and Brazil. Brazil
was the only country in Latin America to gain its independence without
bloodshed. The invasion of Portugal by Napoleon in 1808 had forced King Jo√£o
VI to escape to Brazil and establish his court in Rio de Janeiro. For thirteen
years, Portugal was ruled from Brazil (the only instance of such a reversal of
roles between colony and metropole) until his return to Portugal in 1821. His
son, Dom Pedro, was left in charge of Brazil and in 1822 he declared
independence from Portugal and himself the Emperor of Brazil. Unlike Spain's
former colonies which had abandoned the monarchy in favour of republicanism,
Brazil therefore retained its links with its monarchy, the House of Braganza.
India. Vasco da Gama's maritime success to discover for Europeans a new sea
route to India in 1498 paved the way for direct Indo-European commerce. The
Portuguese soon set up trading-posts in Goa, Daman, Diu and Bombay. The next to
arrive were the Dutch, the British‚Äîwho set up a trading-post in the west-
coast port of Surat in 1619‚Äîand the French. The internal conflicts among
Indian Kingdoms gave opportunities to the European traders to gradually
establish political influence and appropriate lands. Although these continental
European powers were to control various regions of southern and eastern India
during the ensuing century, they would eventually lose all their territories in
India to the British islanders, with the exception of the French outposts of
Pondicherry and Chandernagore, the Dutch port in Travancore, and the Portuguese
colonies of Goa, Daman, and Diu. The British raj. The English East India
Company had been given permission by the Mughal emperor Jahangir in 1617 to
trade in India. Gradually the Company's increasing influence led the "de jure"
Mughal emperor Farrukh Siyar to grant them "dastaks" or permits for duty free
trade in Bengal in 1717. The Nawab of Bengal Siraj Ud Daulah, the "de facto"
ruler of the Bengal province, opposed British attempts to use these permits.
This led to the Battle of Plassey in 1757, in which the armies of the East
India Company, led by Robert Clive, defeated the Nawab's forces. This was the
first political foothold with territorial implications that the British had
acquired in India. Clive was appointed by the Company as its first Governor of
Bengal in 1757. This was combined with British victories over the French at
Madras, Wandiwash and Pondicherry that, along with wider British successes
during the Seven Years War, reduced French influence in India. After the Battle
of Buxar in 1764, the Company acquired the civil rights of administration in
Bengal from the Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II; it marked the beginning of its
formal rule, which was to engulf eventually most of India and extinguish the
Moghul rule and dynasty itself in less than a century. The East India Company
monopolized the trade of Bengal. They introduced a land taxation system called
the Permanent Settlement which introduced a feudal-like structurea (See
"Zamindar") in Bengal. By the 1850s, the East India Company controlled most of
the Indian sub-continent, which included present-day Pakistan and Bangladesh.
Their policy was sometimes summed up as Divide and Rule, taking advantage of
the enmity festering between various princely states and social and religious
groups. The first major movement against the British Company's high handed rule
resulted in the Indian Rebellion of 1857, also known as the "Indian Mutiny" or
"Sepoy Mutiny" or the "First War of Independence". After a year of turmoil, and
reinforcement of the East India Company's troops with British soldiers, the
Company overcame the rebellion. The nominal leader of the uprising, the last
Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar, was exiled to Burma, his children were
beheaded and the Moghul line abolished. In the aftermath all power was
transferred from the East India Company to the British Crown, which began to
administer most of India as a colony; the Company's lands were controlled
directly and the rest through the rulers of what it called the Princely states.
There were 565 princely states when the Indian subcontinent gained independence
from Britain in August 1947. During the British Raj, famines in India, often
attributed to failed government policies, were some of the worst ever recorded,
including the Great Famine of 1876‚Äì78, in which 6.1 million to 10.3 million
people died and the Indian famine of 1899‚Äì1900, in which 1.25 to 10 million
people died. The Third Plague Pandemic started in China in the middle of the
19th century, spreading plague to all inhabited continents and killing 10
million people in India alone. Despite persistent diseases and famines,
however, the population of the Indian subcontinent, which stood at about 125
million in 1750, had reached 389 million by 1941. New Imperialism
(1870‚Äì1914). The policy and ideology of European colonial expansion between
the 1870s and the outbreak of World War I in 1914 are often characterised as
the "New Imperialism". The period is distinguished by an unprecedented pursuit
of what has been termed "empire for empire's sake", aggressive competition for
overseas territorial acquisitions and the emergence in colonising countries of
doctrines of racial superiority which denied the fitness of subjugated peoples
for self-government. During this period, Europe's powers added nearly 8,880,000
square miles (23,000,000¬ km¬≤) to their overseas colonial possessions. As it
was mostly unoccupied by the Western powers as late as the 1880s, Africa became
the primary target of the "new" imperialist expansion (known as The Scramble
for Africa), although conquest took place also in other areas ‚Äî notably
south-east Asia and the East Asian seaboard, where Japan joined the European
powers' scramble for territory. The Berlin Conference (1884‚Äì1885) mediated
the imperial competition among Britain, France and Germany, defining "effective
occupation" as the criterion for international recognition of colonial claims
and codifying the imposition of direct rule, accomplished usually through armed
force. A decade later, rival imperialisms would collide in the 1898 Fashoda
Incident, during which war between France and Britain was barely avoided. This
fear led to new alliances, and in 1904 the "Entente Cordiale" was signed
between both powers. Imperialistic rivalry between the European powers was a
main cause of the triggering of World War I in 1914. In Germany, rising pan-
germanism was coupled to imperialism in the "Alldeutsche Verband" ("Pangermanic
League"), which argued that Britain's world power position gave the British
unfair advantages on international markets, thus limiting Germany's economic
growth and threatening its security. The scramble for Africa. Many European
statesmen and industrialists wanted to accelerate the Scramble for Africa,
securing colonies before they strictly needed them. The champion of
Realpolitik, Bismarck thus pushed a Weltpolitik vision ("World Politic"), which
considered the colonization as a necessity for the emerging German power.
German colonies in Togoland, Samoa, South-West Africa and New Guinea had
corporate commercial roots, while the equivalent German-dominated areas in East
Africa and China owed more to political motives. The British also took an
interest in Africa, using the East Africa company to take over Kenya and
Uganda. The British crown formally took over in 1895 and renamed the area the
East Africa Protectorate. Leopold II of Belgium personally owned the Congo Free
State from 1885 to 1908, while the Dutch had the Dutch East Indies. In the same
manner, Italy tried to conquer its "place in the sun", acquiring Somaliland in
1899-90, Eritrea and 1899, and, taking advantage of the "Sick man of Europe",
the Ottoman Empire, also conquered Tripolitania and Cyrenaica (modern Libya)
with the 1911 Treaty of Lausanne. The conquest of Ethiopia, which had remained
the last African independent territory, had to wait till the Second Italo-
Abyssinian War in 1935‚Äì36 (the First Italo‚ÄìEthiopian War in 1895‚Äì96 had
ended in defeat for Italy). The Portuguese and Spanish colonial empire were
smaller, mostly legacies of past colonization. Most of their colonies had
acquired independence during the Latin American revolutions at the beginning of
the nineteenth century. Imperialism in Asia. In Asia, the Great Game, which
lasted from 1813 to 1907, opposed the British Empire against Imperial Russia
for supremacy in central Asia. China was opened to Western influence starting
with the First and Second Opium Wars (1839‚Äì1842; 1856‚Äì1860). After the
visits of Commodore Matthew Perry in 1852‚Äì1854, Japan opened itself to the
Western world during the Meiji Era (1868‚Äì1912). The above basically concerns
India and China. But other or the same forms of Imperialism, that should not be
overlooked, were in action in Burma, Indonesia (Netherlands East Indies),
Malaya and the Philippines. Inter-War Period (1918‚Äì1939). The colonial map
was redrawn following the defeat of Germany and the Ottoman Empire after the
first World War (1914‚Äì18). Colonies from the defeated empires were
transferred to the newly founded League of Nations, which itself redistributed
it to the victorious powers as "mandates". The secret 1916 Sykes-Picot
Agreement partitioned the Middle East between Britain and France, and the 1917
Balfour Declaration promised to the international Zionist movement their
support in creating a Jewish homeland in Palestine, later to become the state
of Israel. French mandates included Syria and Lebanon, whilst the British were
handed Iraq and Palestine. The bulk of the Arabian peninsula became the
independent Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1922. The discovery of the world's
largest easily accessible crude oil deposits led to an influx of Western oil
companies that dominated the region's economies until the 1970s, and making the
emirs of the oil states immensely rich, enabling them to consolidate their hold
on power and giving them a stake in preserving Western hegemony over the
region. During the 1920 and 1930s Iraq, Syria and Egypt moved towards
independence, although the British and French did not formally depart the
region until they were forced to do so after World War II. Japanese
imperialism. After being closed for centuries to Western influence, Japan
opened itself to the West during the Meiji Era (1868‚Äì1912), characterized by
swift modernization and borrowings from European culture (in law, science,
etc.) This, in turn, helped make Japan the modern power that it is now, which
was symbolized as soon as the 1904‚Äì1905 Russo-Japanese War: this war marked
the first victory of an Asian people against a European imperial power, and led
to widespread fears among European populations (first appearance of the "Yellow
Peril"). During the first part of the twentieth century, while China was still
victim of various European imperialisms, Japan became an imperialist power,
conquering what it called a "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere". Japan's
encroachment on Korea began with the Japan‚ÄìKorea Treaty of 1876 with the
Joseon Dynasty of Korea, increased with the 1895 assassination of Empress
Myeongseong and the 1905 Japan‚ÄìKorea Treaty of 1905, and was completed with
the illicit 1910 Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty. In 1910, Korea was formally
annexed to the Japanese Empire. The Japanese colonization of Korea was
particularly brutal, even by twentieth century standards. This brutal
colonization included the use of Korean "comfort women" who were forced to
serve as sex slaves in Japanese Army brothels. In 1931 Japanese army units
based in Manchuria seized control of the region; full-scale war with China
followed in 1937, drawing Japan toward an overambitious bid for Asian hegemony
(Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere), which ultimately led to defeat and
the loss of all its overseas territories after World War II (see Japanese
expansionism and Japanese nationalism). As in Korea, the Japanese treatment of
the Chinese people was particularly brutal as exemplified by the Nanjing
Massacre. Decolonization (1945‚Äì97). Anticolonialist movements had begun to
gain momentum after the close of World War I, which had seen colonial troops
fight alongside those of the metropole, and U.S. President Woodrow Wilson's
speech on the Fourteen Points. However, it was not until the end of World War
II that they fully mobilised. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and U.S.
President Franklin D. Roosevelt's 1941 Atlantic Charter declared that the
signatories would "respect the right of all peoples to choose the form of
government under which they will live". Though Churchill subsequently claimed
this applied only to those countries under Nazi occupation, rather than the
British Empire, the words were not so easily retracted: for example, the
legislative assembly of Britain's most important colony, India, passed a
resolution stating that the Charter should apply to it too. To nationalist
movements, it was hypocritical and morally indefensible for colonial
governments to expect their colonies to fight side by side with them in a
struggle against the racist ideologies of Nazism and fascism, yet at the same
time expect to return to the white supremacy of the status ante bellum, once
hostilities had ceased. Moreover, Roosevelt and the American public were firmly
of the mind that they were not, as "Life magazine" put it in 1942, "fighting
... to hold the British Empire together". In 1945, the United Nations (UN) was
founded when 50 nations signed the UN Charter, which included a statement of
its basis in the respect for the principle of equal rights and self-
determination of peoples. In 1952, demographer Alfred Sauvy coined the term
"Third World" in reference to the French Third Estate. The expression
distinguished nations that aligned themselves with neither the West nor with
the Soviet Bloc during the Cold War. In the following decades, decolonization
would strengthen this group which began to be represented at the United
Nations. The Third World's first international move was the 1955 Bandung
Conference, led by Jawaharlal Nehru for India, Gamal Abdel Nasser for Egypt and
Josip Broz Tito for Yugoslavia. The Conference, which gathered 29 countries
representing over half the world's population, led to the creation of the Non-
Aligned Movement in 1961. Although the U.S. had first opposed itself to
colonial powers, in particular during the 1956 Suez crisis between Egypt,
France, the UK and Israel, the Cold War concerns about Soviet influence in the
Third World caused it to downplay its advocacy of popular sovereignty and
decolonization. France thus had a free hand in the First Indochina War
(1946‚Äì54) and in the Algerian war of independence (1954‚Äì62), where torture
techniques were heavily employed (the Algerian war would become a military
model of counter-insurgency tactics, and has been studied ever since in
military schools throughout the world). Furthermore, attempts such as
Mossadegh's nationalisation of the petroil in Iran were blocked by the U.S.,
who supported a coup in 1953 order to impose Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi (the
covert operation was named Operation Ajax). The next year, when Guatemala's
president Arbenz tried to nationalise the United Fruit, the Central
Intelligence Agency overthrew him and replaced him by a military "junta" in
Operation PBSuccess. In spite of these interferences in other states,
decolonization itself was a seemingly unstoppable process. In 1960, after
several wars of national liberation, the UN had reached 99 members states: the
decolonization of Africa was almost complete. In 1980, the UN had 154 member
states, and in 1990, after Namibia's independence, 159 states But what could be
seen retrospectively as a gigantic and quiet wave representing the "Zeitgeist"
("Spirit of Times") overthrowing the domination of European colonialist powers
was in fact the product of the struggle of the colonized people, whom many paid
it with their lives. In effect, although the anticolonialist struggle didn't
lead in all cases to wars such as the Algerian War (1954‚Äì62), it was
nevertheless bloody. Many anticolonialist leaders were assassinated in more or
less obscure circumstances in the 1960s, whether by foreign powers or internal
enemies, sometimes supported by foreign powers who more or less openly
supported dictatorships (for example, France and its ties with the
"Fran√ßafrique"). The most famous names shouldn't dissimulate others less-known
leaders, but a quick enumeration of slain anti-imperialist leaders would
include Patrice Lumumba, the first Prime minister of the Democratic Republic of
the Congo assassinated in 1961; Sylvanus Olympio, the first president of Togo,
assassinated in 1963 (quickly replaced by Gnassingb√© Eyad√©ma, who would rule
Togo until his death in 2005); Mehdi Ben Barka, leader of the Moroccan
opposition, who was preparing the Tricontinental Conference which was supposed
to gather in La Habana in 1966 national liberation movements (not states) from
all continents in order to organize the anti-imperialist struggle (kidnapped in
Paris); Eduardo Mondlane, the leader of the Mozambiquan FRELIMO, allegedly
assassinated by "Aginter Press", the Portuguese branch of Gladio ‚Äî NATO's
anti-communist paramilitary organization during the Cold War ‚Äî Amilcar
Cabral, Oscar Romero, the prelate archbishop of San Salvador and a proponent of
Liberation Theology, or Dulcie September, African National Congress (ANC)
activist murdered in Paris in 1988. Role of the USSR and China. The Soviet
Union was a main supporter of decolonization movements. While the Non-Aligned
Movement, created in 1961 following the Bandung 1955 Conference, was supposedly
neutral, the "Third World" being opposed to both the "First" and the "Second"
Worlds, geopolitical concerns, as well as the refusal of the U.S. to support
decolonization movements against its NATO European allies, led the national
liberation movements to look increasingly toward the East. However, China's
appearance on the world scene, under the leadership of Mao Zedong, created a
rupture between the Soviet Union and independentists movements. Globally, the
non-aligned movement, led by Jawaharlal Nehru (India), Josip Broz Tito
(Yugoslavia) and Gamal Abdel Nasser (Egypt) tried to create a block of nations
powerful enough to be dependent on neither the U.S. nor the Soviet Union, but
finally tilted towards the U.S.S.R, while smaller liberation movements, both by
strategic necessity and ideological choice, were supported either by Moscow or
by Peking. The Cuban government, led by Fidel Castro after the Cuban revolution
of 1959, was at first neutral before turning itself towards Moscow. Cuba also
sponsored liberation movements in Angola and Mozambique. Few liberation
movements were totally independent from foreign aid.
