Bourbon Restoration The Bourbon Restoration is the name given to the period
following the successive events of the French Revolution (1789‚Äì1799), the end
of the First Republic (1792‚Äì1804), and then the forcible end of the First
French Empire under Napoleon (1804‚Äì1814/1815)¬ ‚Äì when a coalition of
European powers restored by arms the monarchy to the heirs of the House of
Bourbon, who once again became possessors of the Kingdom of France. The Bourbon
Restoration existed from (about) 6 April 1814 until the popular uprisings of
the July Revolution of 1830, excepting the interval of the "Hundred Days", less
than a full year into the Restoration, when the Bourbon monarchy had again made
themselves so unpopular with the general population of France that the family
was again forced to flee Paris and France for Ghent, ahead of exploding civil
disorders and collapsing civil authority. At the beginning of the Hundred Days,
deposed Emperor Napoleon I returned triumphantly to Paris from Elba. He was
greeted with great acclaim and joy by French crowds lining the roads. Coming
from far away with advance news spreading of his approach all along the way,
crowds swelled his army overnight at his back, growing at every step, even by
aggregating the very troops sent to arrest him by the monarchy on several
occasions. With the flight of the king, after reaching Paris, he re-announced
and reclaimed his dignities as Emperor. The European Great Powers were nowhere
near as welcoming, and they quickly mobilized armies once more. This resulted
in Napoleon's decisive defeat in 1815 at the Battle of Waterloo. There is
little evidence that the Bourbon regime took away any lesson in the aftermath,
and became increasingly annoying to the Parisian populace, and around France in
general. The pre-revolution problems soon returned with court behavior driving
home new hatreds between the upper and lower classes. The new Bourbon regime
was, however, a constitutional monarchy, unlike the "Ancien R√©gime", which was
absolute, so it had some limits on its abilities to govern. The period was
characterized by a sharp conservative reaction, and consequent minor but
consistent occurrences of civil unrest and disturbances. It also saw the re-
establishment of the Roman Catholic Church as a power in French politics.
Historical overview. The Armies of the Sixth Coalition restored Louis XVIII,
called the "Bourbon pretender" by historiographers, especially by those
unfavorable to the restoration of the monarchy, to the throne of France in
April 1814. A constitution, the Charter of 1814, was drafted, presenting all
Frenchmen equal before the law, but retaining substantial prerogative for the
king and nobility. Louis XVIII was the supreme head of the state. He commanded
the land and sea forces, declared war, made treaties of peace, alliance and
commerce, appointed to all places of public administration, and made the
necessary regulations and ordinances for the execution of the laws and the
security of the state. Louis was more liberal than his successor Charles X,
choosing many centrist cabinets. Louis XVIII died in September 1824. He was
succeeded by his brother, Charles. Charles X pursued a more conservative form
of governance than Louis. His ultra-reactionary laws included the Anti-
Sacrilege Act (1825‚Äì1830), which saw his popularity plummet. The king and his
ministers attempted to manipulate the outcome of a general election in 1830,
through their July Ordinances. The ordinances sparked a revolution against
Charles's "coup" attempt; by 2 August 1830, Charles had fled Paris and
abdicated in favour of his grandson Henri, duc de Bordeaux. Henri's theoretical
reign was ended on 9 August when the Chamber of Deputies declared Louis
Philippe d'Orl√©ans, who was currently ruling France as regent, King of the
French, thus ushering in the July Monarchy. Louis XVIII, 1814‚Äì1824. First
Restoration (1814). Louis XVIII's restoration to the throne in 1814 was
effected largely through the support of Napoleon's former foreign minister,
Talleyrand, who convinced the victorious Allied Powers of the desirability of a
Bourbon Restoration. The Allies had initially split on the best candidate for
the throne: Britain favoured the Bourbons, the Austrians considered a regency
for Napoleon's son, Fran√ßois Bonaparte, and the Russians were open to either
the duc d'Orl√©ans, Louis Philippe, or Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, Napoleon's
former Marshal, who was in line for the Swedish throne. Napoleon was offered to
keep the throne in February 1814, on the condition that France returned to its
1792 frontiers, but he refused. The feasibility of the Restoration was in
doubt, but the allure of peace to a war-weary French public, and demonstrations
of support for the Bourbons in Paris, Bordeaux, Marseille, and Lyons, helped
assure the Allies. Louis, in accordance with the Declaration of Saint-Ouen,
granted a written constitution, the Charter of 1814, which guaranteed a
bicameral legislature with a hereditary/appointive Chamber of Peers and an
elected Chamber of Deputies ‚Äì their role was consultative (except on
taxation), as only the King had the power to propose or sanction laws, and
appoint or recall ministers. The franchise was limited to men with considerable
property holdings, and around 1% of people could vote. Many of the legal,
administrative, and economic reforms of the revolutionary period were left
intact; the Napoleonic Code, which guaranteed legal equality and civil
liberties, the peasants' "biens nationaux", and the new system of dividing the
country into "d√©partments" were not undone by the new king. Relations between
church and state remained regulated by the Concordat of 1801. However, in spite
of the fact that the Charter was a condition of the Restoration, the preamble
declared it to be a 'concession and grant', given 'by the free exercise of our
royal authority'. After a first sentimental flush of popularity, Louis'
gestures towards reversing the results of the French Revolution quickly lost
him support among the disenfranchised majority. Symbolic acts, such as the
replacement of the tricolore with the white flag, the titling of Louis as the
'XVIII' (as successor to Louis XVII, who never ruled) and as 'King of France'
rather than 'King of the French', and the monarchy's recognition of the
anniversaries of the deaths of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette were significant.
A more tangible source of antagonism was the pressure applied to possessors of
"biens nationaux" by the Catholic Church and returning "√©migr√©s" to give back
their lands. Other groups bearing ill sentiment towards Louis included the
army, non-Catholics, and workers hit by a post-war slump and British imports.
Second Restoration (1815). Napoleon's emissaries informed him of this brewing
discontent, and, on 20 March 1815, he returned to Paris from Elba. On his Route
Napol√©on, most troops sent to stop his march, including some that were
nominally royalist, felt more inclined to join the former Emperor than to stop
him. Louis was forced to flee Paris to Ghent on 19 March, but returned after
the Battle of Waterloo ended Napoleon's rule of the Hundred Days. In Louis'
absence, a small revolt in the traditionally pro-royalist Vend√©e was put down,
but there were otherwise few subversive acts favouring the Restoration, even
though Napoleon's popularity began to flag. Talleyrand was again influential in
seeing that the Bourbons reigned, as was Fouch√©, Napoleon's minister of police
during the Hundred Days. This Second Restoration saw the beginning of the
Second White Terror, largely in the south, when supporters of the monarchy
sought revenge against those who had supported Napoleon's return, killing
200‚Äì300 and forcing thousands to flee. The perpetrators were often known as
the "Verdets" because of their green cockets, which was the colour of the comte
d'Artois ‚Äì this being the title of Charles X at the time, who was associated
with the hardline ultra-royalists, or Ultras. After a period in which local
authorities were powerless to stop the violence, the King and his ministers
sent out their own officials to restore order. A Second Treaty of Paris was
signed on 20 November 1815, which had more punitive terms than the First.
France was ordered to pay 700 million francs in indemnities, and the country's
borders were reduced to their 1790 level. After the Battle of Waterloo, France
was occupied by 1.2¬ million foreign soldiers; occupation continued until 1818,
by around 200,000 Allies, and France was made to pay the costs of their
accommodation and rations, on top of the reparations. The promise of tax cuts,
prominent in 1814, failed to actualize because of these payments. The legacy of
this, and the White Terror, left Louis with a formidable opposition. Louis'
chief ministers were at first moderate, including Talleyrand, the Duc de
Richelieu, and √âlie, duc Decazes; Louis himself followed a cautious policy.
The "chambre introuvable", elected in 1815 and given the nickname
"unobtainable" by Louis, due to the overwhelming ultra-royalist majority, threw
out the Talleyrand-Fouch√© government and sought to legitimize the White
Terror, passing trial against enemies of the state, sacking 50,000‚Äì80,000
civil service members, and dismissing 15,000 army officers. Richelieu, an
"√©migr√©" who had left in October 1789, who "had had nothing at all to do with
the new France", was appointed Prime Minister. The "chambre introuvable",
meanwhile, continued to aggressively uphold the place of the monarchy and the
church, and called for more commemorations for historical royal figures. Over
the course of the parliamentary term, the ultra-royalists increasingly began to
fuse their brand of politics with state ceremony, much to Louis' chagrin.
Decazes, perhaps the most moderate minister, moved to stop the politicization
of the National Guard (many "Verdets" had been drafted in) by banning political
demonstrations by the militia in July 1816. Owing to contrasting standpoints of
the chamber and the King, the ultra-royalists began to assert the Chamber of
Deputies' rights. This resulted in a concession from the government that the
chamber had the right to approve state expenditure, granted after the ultra-
royalists attempted to obstruct the 1816 budget. However, they were unable to
gain a guarantee from the King that his cabinets would represent the majority
in parliament. In September 1816, the chamber was dissolved by Louis for its
reactionary measures, and electoral manipulation resulted in a more liberal
chamber in 1816. Richelieu served until 29 December 1818, followed by Jean-
Joseph, Marquis Dessolles until 19 November 1819, and then Decazes (in reality
the dominant minister from 1818 to 1820) until 20 February 1820. This was the
era in which the "Doctrinaires" dominated policy. The following year, the
government changed the electoral laws, resorting to gerrymandering, and
altering the franchise to allow some rich men of trade and industry to vote, in
an attempt to prevent the ultras of winning a majority in future elections.
Press censorship was clarified and relaxed, some positions in the military
hierarchy were made open to competition, and mutual schools were set up that
encroached on the Catholic monopoly of public primary education. Decazes purged
a number of ultra-royalist prefects and sub-prefects, and in by-elections, an
unusually high proportion of Bonapartists and republicans were elected, some of
whom were backed by ultras resorting to tactical voting. The ultras were
strongly critical of the practice of giving civil service employment or
promotions to deputies, as the government continued to consolidate its
position. By 1820, the opposition liberals, who with the ultras made up half
the chamber, proved unmanageable, and Decazes and the king were looking for
ways to revise the electoral laws again, to ensure a more tractable
conservative majority. The assassination of the Duc de Berry, the
ultrareactionary son of Louis' ultrareactionary brother and heir-presumptive,
the future Charles X, by a Bonapartist in February 1820, triggered Decazes'
fall from power and the triumph of the Ultras. Richelieu returned to power for
a short interval, from 1820 to 1821. The press was more strongly censored,
detention without trial was reintroduced, and "Doctrinaire" leaders, such as
Fran√ßois Guizot, were banned from teaching at the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure.
Under Richelieu, the franchise was changed to give the wealthiest electors a
double vote, in time for the November 1820 election. After a resounding
victory, a new Ultra ministry was formed, headed by Jean-Baptiste de Vill√®le,
a leading Ultra who served for six years. The ultras found themselves back in
power in favourable circumstances: Berry's wife, the duchesse de Berry, gave
birth to "miracle child", Henri, seven months after the duc's death; Napoleon
died on Saint Helena in 1821, and his son, the duc de Reichstadt, remained
interned in Austrian hands. Literary figures, most notably Chateaubriand, but
also Hugo, Lamartine, Vigny, and Nodier, rallied to the ultras' cause. Both
Hugo and Lamartine later became republicans, whilst Nodier was formerly. Soon,
however, Vill√®le proved himself to be nearly as cautious as his master, and,
so long as Louis lived, overtly reactionary policies were kept to a minimum.
The ultras broadened their support, and put a stop to growing military dissent
in 1823, when intervention in Spain, in favour of Spanish Bourbon King
Ferdinand VII, and against the Liberal Spanish Government, fomented popular
patriotic fervour. Despite British backing for the military action, the
intervention was widely seen as an attempt to win back influence in Spain,
which had been lost to the British under Napoleon. The French army, called the
Hundred Thousand Sons of Saint Louis, was led by the duc d'Angoul√™me, the
comte d'Artois's son. The French troops marched to Madrid and then to Cadiz,
ousting the Liberals with little fighting (April to September 1823), and would
remain in Spain for five years. Support for the ultras was further strengthened
by doling out favours in a similar fashion to the 1816 chamber, and fears over
the "charbonnerie", the French equivalent of the "carbonari". In the 1824
election, another large majority was secured. Louis XVIII died on 16 September
1824, and was succeeded by his brother, the comte d'Artois, who took the title
of Charles X. Charles X, 1824‚Äì1830. The ascension to the throne of Charles X,
the leader of the ultra-royalist faction, coincided with the ultras' control of
power in the Chamber of Deputies; thus, the ministry of the comte de Vill√®le
was able to continue, and the last "restraint" (i.e., Louis) on the ultra-
royalists was removed. As the country underwent a Christian revival in the
post-Revolutionary years, the ultras saw fit to upraise the status of the Roman
Catholic Church once more. The Concordat of 11 June 1817 was set to replace the
Concordat of 1801, but, despite being signed, it was never validated. The
Vill√®le government, under pressure from the "Chevaliers de la Foi", which many
deputies were members of, voted on the Anti-Sacrilege Act in January 1825,
which punished by death the theft of consecrated hosts as parricide. The law
was unenforceable and only enacted for symbolic purposes, though the act's
passing caused a considerable uproar, particularly among the "Doctrinaires". On
29 May 1825, Charles received his coronation in Reims, in an opulent and
spectacular ceremony that was reminiscent of the royal pomp of the coronations
of the "Ancien R√©gime". Some innovations were included, upon request by
Vill√®le: though Charles was hostile towards the 1814 Charter, commitment to
the 'constitutional charter' was affirmed, and four of Napoleon's generals were
in attendance. The Reims Cathedral was decorated to portray the union of Altar
and Throne, and Charles Percier, the architect, adorned the building with Neo-
Gothic d√©cor, in a style that evoked the Middle Ages, rather than the Roman-
influenced "Empire style" that he was renowned for. Charles was anointed with
the sacred oil brought from heaven by a dove in 496; he prostrated himself
before the altar; and received the ring, sceptre, hand of justice and then the
crown. Charles even touched some people ill with scrofula, and some were
reported to have recovered. Hugo, Lamartine, and Rossini lauded over the
ceremony, while critics saw cause for alarm, and B√©ranger notoriously mocked
the King in a song, titled "The Coronation of King Charles the Simple". Others
went as far as to accuse Charles of being a crypto-Jesuit. In the months
preceding the ceremony, the chambers approved legislation that paid an
indemnity to "√©migr√©s", who had suffered by the confiscation of their lands
during the Revolution, and the requirement that all children would inherit an
equal share of land; thus, ending the law of primogeniture. Although this law
had been engineered by Louis, Charles was influential in seeing that it was
passed. A bill to finance this compensation, by converting government debt (the
"rente") from 5% to 3% bonds, which would save the state 30 million francs a
year in interest payments, was also put before the chambers. Vill√®le's
government argued that "rentiers" had seen their returns grow
disproportionately, compared to their original investment, and that the
redistribution was just and would reconcile "√©migr√©s" to post-Revolutionary
France; whereas, the opposition accused the ultras of taking money from small
investors for disloyal nobles. The bill was eventually defeated in the Peers,
where there was still a liberal contingent sitting, mainly appointees of
Decazes. When the bill to reimburse "√©migr√©s" went through in April, at a
cost to the state of approximately 988 million francs ("le milliard des
√©migr√©s"), it was financed by government bonds at a value of 600¬ million
francs, at an interest rate of 3%. Around 18¬ million francs were paid to the
"√©migr√©s" per year. The state's payments were slower than expected, as the
market value of the bonds fell; a quarter of those reimbursed received only 250
francs a year. Ironically, the main beneficiaries were perhaps the owners of
"biens nationaux", numbering around one million, as their property had been
guaranteed as one of the conditions for the act's passing, which subsequently
led to a rise in the value of their land. In 1826, Vill√®le introduced a bill
reestablishing the law of primogeniture; at least, it would be automatic for
owners of large estates, unless they chose otherwise. The liberal Peers and
press rebelled, as did some dissident ultras, such as Chateaubriand. The
forcefulness of this criticism prompted the government to introduce a bill to
restrict the press in December, having largely withdrawn censorship in 1824;
this, however, only aggravated the ultras' opponents more, and the bill was
withdrawn. The Vill√®le cabinet faced increasing pressure in 1827 from the
liberal press, including the "Journal des d√©bats", which hosted
Chateaubriand's articles. Chateaubriand, the most prominent of the anti-
Vill√®le ultras, had combined with others opposed to press censorship laws (a
new law had reimposed it on 24 July 1827) to form the "Soci√©t√© des amis de la
libert√© de la presse"; Choiseul-Stainville, Salvandy and Villemain were among
the contributors. Another influential society was the "Soci√©t√©, Aide-toi, le
ciel t'aidera", which worked within the confines of legislation, banning the
unauthorized assemblage of more than 20 members. The group, emboldened by the
rising tide of opposition, was of a more liberal composition (it was associated
with "Le Globe") and included members such as Guizot, R√©musat, and Barrot.
Pamphlets were sent out which evaded the censorship laws, and the group
provided organizational assistance to liberal candidates against pro-government
state officials in the November 1827 election. In April 1827, the King and
Vill√®le were confronted by an unruly National Guard. The garrison which
Charles reviewed, under orders to express deference to the king but disapproval
of his government, instead shouted derogatory anti-Jesuit remarks at his
devoutly Catholic niece, Marie Th√©r√®se, Madame la Dauphine. Vill√®le suffered
worse treatment, as liberal officers led troops to protest at his office. In
response, the Guard was disbanded. Pamphlets continued to be proliferated,
which included accusations in September that Charles, on a trip to the northern
"d√©partments", was holed up in Saint-Omer, was colluding with the Pope and
planned to reinstate the tithe, and had suspended the Charter under the
protection of a loyal garrison army. By the time of the election, the moderate
royalists (constitutionalists) were also beginning to turn against Charles, as
was the business community, in part due to a financial crisis in 1825, that was
blamed on the government's passing of the law of indemnification. Hugo and a
number of other writers, dissatisfied with the reality of life under Charles X,
also began to criticize the regime. In preparation for the 30 September
registration cut-off for the election, opposition committees worked furiously
to get as many voters as possible signed up, countering the actions of
"pr√©fects", who began removing certain voters who had failed to provide up-to-
date documents since the 1824 election. 18,000 voters were added to the 60,000
on the first list; despite pr√©fect attempts to register those who met the
franchise and were supporters of the government, this can mainly be attributed
to opposition activity. Organization was mainly divided behind Chateaubriand's
Friends and the "Aide-toi"; the "Aide-toi" backed liberals, "constitutionnels",
and the "contre-opposition" (constitutional monarchists). The new chamber did
not result in a clear majority for any side. Vill√®le's successor, the vicomte
de Martignac, who began his term in January 1828, tried to steer a middle
course, appeasing liberals by loosening press controls, expelling Jesuits,
modifying electoral registration, and restricting the formation of Catholic
schools. Charles, unhappy with the new government, surrounded himself with men
from the "Chevaliers de la Foi" and other ultras, such as the Prince de
Polignac and La Bourdonnaye. Martignac was deposed when his government lost a
bill on local government. Charles and his advisers believed a new government
could be formed with the support of the Vill√®le, Chateaubriand, and Decazes
monarchist factions, but chose a chief minister, Polignac, in November 1829 who
was repellant to the liberals and, worse, Chateaubriand. Though Charles
remained nonchalant, the deadlock led some royalists to call for a "coup", and
prominent liberals for a tax strike. At the opening of the session in March
1830, the King delivered a speech that contained veiled threats to the
opposition; in response, 221 deputies (an absolute majority) condemned the
government, and Charles subsequently prorogued and then dissolved parliament.
Charles retained a belief that he was popular amongst the unenfranchised mass
of the people, and he and Polignac chose to pursue an ambitious foreign policy
of colonialism and expansionism, with the assistance of Russia. France had
intervened in the Mediterranean a number of times after Vill√®le's resignation,
and expeditions were now sent to Greece and Madagascar. Polignac also initiated
French colonization in Algeria; victory was announced over the Dey of Algiers
in early June. Plans were drawn up to invade Belgium, which was shortly to
undergo its own revolution. However, foreign policy did not prove sufficient to
divert attention from domestic problems. Charles's dissolution of the chamber
of deputies, his "July Ordinances", which set up rigid control of the press,
and his restriction of suffrage resulted in the July Revolution of 1830. The
major cause of the regime's downfall, however, was that, while it managed to
keep the support of the aristocracy, the Catholic Church and even much of the
peasantry, the ultras' cause was deeply unpopular outside of parliament and
with those who did not hold the franchise, especially the industrial workers
and the bourgeoisie. Charles abdicated in favor of his grandson, the Comte de
Chambord, and left for England. However, the liberal, bourgeois-controlled
Chamber of Deputies refused to confirm the Comte de Chambord as Henri V. In a
vote largely boycotted by conservative deputies, the body declared the French
throne vacant, and elevated Louis-Philippe, Duke of Orl√©ans, to power. The
Fall of the "Restoration", 1827‚Äì1830. There is still considerable debate
among historians as to the actual cause of the downfall of Charles X. What is
generally conceded, though, is that between 1820 and 1830, a series of economic
downturns, combined with the rise of a liberal opposition within the Chamber of
Deputies, ultimately felled the conservative Bourbons. Between 1827 and 1830,
France faced an economic downturn, industrial and agricultural, that was
possibly worse than the one that sparked the Revolution of 1789. A series of
progressively worsening grain harvests in the late 1820s pushed up the prices
on various staple foods and cash crops. In response, the rural peasantry
throughout France lobbied for the relaxation of protective tariffs on grain, in
order to lower prices and ease their economic situation. However, Charles X,
bowing to pressure from wealthier landowners, kept the tariffs in place. He did
so based upon the Bourbon response to the "Year Without a Summer" in 1816,
during which Louis XVIII relaxed tariffs during a series of famines, caused a
downturn in prices, and incurred the ire of wealthy landowners, who were the
traditional source of Bourbon legitimacy. Thus, peasants throughout France,
between 1827 and 1830, faced a period of relative economic hardship and rising
prices. At the same time, international pressures, combined with weakened
purchasing power from the provinces, led to decreased economic activity in
urban centers. This industrial downturn contributed to the rising poverty
levels among Parisian artisans. Thus, by 1830, multiple demographics had
suffered from the economic policies of Charles X. While the French economy
faltered, a series of elections brought a relatively powerful liberal bloc into
the Chamber of Deputies. The 17-strong liberal bloc of 1824 grew to 180 in
1827, and 274 in 1830. This liberal majority grew increasingly dissatisfied
with the policies of the centrist Martignac and the ultra-royalist Polignac,
seeking to protect the limited protections of the Charter of 1814. They sought
both the expansion of the franchise, and more liberal economic policies. They
also demanded the right, as the majority bloc, to appoint the Prime Minister
and the Cabinet. Also, the growth of the liberal bloc within the Chamber of
Deputies corresponded roughly with the rise of a liberal press within France.
Generally centered around Paris, this press provided a counterpoint to the
government's journalistic services, and to the newspapers of the right. It grew
increasingly important in conveying political opinions and the political
situation to the Parisian public, and can thus be seen as a crucial link
between the rise of the liberals and the increasingly agitated and economically
suffering French masses. By 1830, the Restoration government of Charles X faced
difficulties on all sides. The new liberal majority clearly had no intention of
budging in the face of Polignac's aggressive policies. The rise of a liberal
press within Paris, that outsold the official government newspaper, indicated a
general shift in Parisian politics towards the left. And yet, Charles' base of
power was certainly toward the right of the political spectrum, as were his own
views. He simply could not yield to the growing demands from within the Chamber
of Deputies. The situation would soon come to a head. The Four Ordinances.
Technically, the Charter of 1814 had made France a constitutional monarchy.
While the King retained extensive power over policy-making, as well as the sole
power of the Executive, he was, nonetheless, reliant upon the Parliament to
accept and pass his legal decrees. The Charter also fixed the method of
election of the Deputies, their rights within the Chamber of Deputies, and the
rights of the majority bloc. Thus, in 1830, Charles X faced a significant
problem. He could not overstep his constitutional bounds, and yet, he could not
preserve his policies with a liberal majority within the Chamber of Deputies.
Stark action was required. Word spread quickly of the king's intent. On 10 July
1830, before the king had even made his declarations, a group of wealthy,
liberal journalists and newspaper proprietors, led by Adolphe Thiers, met in
Paris to decide upon a strategy to counter Charles X. It was decided then,
nearly three weeks before the Revolution, that in the event of Charles'
expected proclamations, the journalistic establishment of Paris would publish
vitriolic criticisms of the king's policies in an attempt to mobilize the
masses. Thus, when Charles X made his declarations on the 25 July 1830, the
liberal journalism machine mobilized, publishing articles and complaints
decrying the despotism of the king's actions. The urban mobs of Paris also
mobilized, driven by patriotic fervor and economic hardship, assembling
barricades and attacking the infrastructure of Charles X. Within days, the
situation escalated beyond the ability of the monarchy to control it. As the
Crown moved to shut down liberal periodicals, the radical Parisian masses
defended those publications. They also launched attacks against pro-Bourbon
presses, and paralyzed the coercive apparatus of the monarchy. Seizing the
opportunity, the liberals in Parliament began drafting resolutions, complaints,
and censures against the king. The king finally abdicated on 30 July 1830.
Twenty minutes later, his son, Louis Antoine, Duke of Angoul√™me, who had
nominally succeeded as Louis XIX, also abdicated, having lasted what is
believed to be the shortest reign on record. The Crown nominally then fell upon
the son of Louis Antoine's younger brother, Charles X's grandson, who became
Henri V, with Louis-Phillippe, Duc d'Orl√©ans, as Lieutenant-General of the
realm. However, the newly-empowered Chamber of Deputies declared the throne
vacant, and on 9 August, elevated Louis-Philippe, to the throne. Thus, the July
Monarchy began. Louis-Philippe and the House of Orl√©ans. Louis-Philippe
ascended the throne on the strength of the July Revolution of 1830, and ruled,
not as "King of France" but as "King of the French", marking the shift to
national sovereignty. The Orl√©anists remained in power until 1848. Following
the ousting of the last king to rule France during the February 1848
Revolution, the Second Republic was formed with the election of Louis-Napol√©on
Bonaparte as President (1848‚Äì1852). In the French coup of 1851, Napoleon
declared himself Emperor Napoleon III of the Second Empire, which lasted from
1852 to 1870. Political parties under Restoration. Political parties saw
substantial changes of alignment and membership under the Restoration. The
Chamber of Deputies oscillated between repressive "ultra-royalist" phases and
progressive "liberal" phases. Opponents of the monarchy were absent from the
political scene, because of the repression of the "White Terror". Individuals
of influence who had different visions of the French constitutional monarchy
clashed. All parties remained fearful of the common people, whom Adolphe Thiers
later referred to by the term "cheap multitude". Their political sights were
set on a favoritism of class. Political changes in the Chamber were due to
abuse by the majority tendency, involving a dissolution and then an inversion
of the majority, or critical events; for example, the assassination of the Duc
de Berry in 1820. Disputes were a power struggle between the powerful (royalty
against deputies) rather than a fight between royalty and populism. Although
the deputies claimed to defend the interests of the people, most had an
important fear of common people, of innovations, of socialism and even of
simple measures, such as the extension of voting rights. Constitutionnels.
Constitutionnels were mostly rich and educated middle-class men: lawyers,
senior officials of the Empire, and academics. They feared the triumph of the
aristocracy, as much as that of the democrats. They accepted the charter,
because it guaranteed freedom and civil equality and created a barrier to the
popular masses who were considered unable, because of their ignorance, to be
involved in the management of public affairs. Important personalities were
Pierre Paul Royer-Collard, Fran√ßois Guizot, and the count of Serre. Their
newspapers were "Le Courrier Fran√ßais" and "Le Censeur". Doctrinaires.
Doctrinaires promoted a return to a moderate monarchy and were opposed to the
extremists in the early period of the Restoration. The most prominent
"Doctrinaire" newspaper was "Le Courrier fran√ßais". Independents. Independents
were mostly lower middle class: doctors and lawyers, bourgeoisie, men of law,
and, in rural constituencies, traders of national goods. They rejected the
charter, considering it too conservative. They rejected the treaties of 1815,
the white flag and the pre-eminence of clergy and of nobility. Important
personalities were parliamentary monarchist Benjamin Constant, officer of the
Empire Maximilien Sebastien Foy, republican lawyer Jacques-Antoine Manuel and
Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette. Their newspapers were "La Minerve",
"Le Constitutionnel" and "Le Globe". Liberal royalists. Liberals appeared as a
party in the last years of the Restoration. Liberal royalists preached movement
towards more liberty and openness. They wished to lower the taxable quota to
support the middle-class as a whole, to the detriment of the aristocracy.
Liberals had profited from the emergence of a new middle-class elite, due to
the Industrial Revolution, which upset the aristocratic order. Republicans.
Facing the representatives of the middle class, the Republicans, then situated
on the extreme left, addressed the miserable world of the worker. Workers were
not represented, nor listened to. Their demonstrations were repressed or
diverted, causing, at most, a reinforcement of parliamentarism, which did not
mean democratic evolution, only wider taxation. For some, such as Blanqui,
revolution seemed the only solution. Garnier-Pag√®s, and Louis-Eug√®ne and
√âl√©onore-Louis Godefroi Cavaignac considered themselves to be Republicans,
while Cabet and Raspail were active as socialists. Saint-Simon was also active
during this period, and made direct appeals to Louis XVIII before his death in
1825. Ultra-royalists. Ultra-royalists wished for a return to the "Ancien
R√©gime", such as before 1789, with a view toward absolutism: domination by the
nobility and "other devoted Christians". They were anti-Republican, anti-
Democratic, and preached "Government on High", by a marked noble elite. They
tolerated "vote censitaire": a form of democracy limited to taxpayers. Ultra-
royalists were interested in preserving aristocracy and promoting absolutism.
They found the Charter of 1814 to be too revolutionary. The ultra-royalists
wanted a return to absolute monarchy, the re-establishment of privileges, and a
king: Charles X. Prominent ultra-royalists theorists were Louis de Bonald and
Joseph de Maistre. Their parliamentary leaders were Fran√ßois R√©gis de La
Bourdonnaye, comte de La Bret√®che and, in 1829, Jules de Polignac. Their main
newspapers were "La Quotidienne" and "La Gazette"; other royalist papers
included the "Drapeau Blanc", named after the Bourbon white flag, and the
"Oriflamme", named after the battle standard of France. Popular culture. The
French Historical film Jacquou le Croquant directed by Laurent Boutonnat,
starring Gaspard Ulliel and Marie-Jos√©e Croze is based on the background of
Bourbon Restoration.
