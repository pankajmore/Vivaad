History of the Republic of the Congo The history of the Republic of the Congo
has been marked by French colonization, a transition to independence, Marxist-
Leninism, and the transition to a market-oriented economy. Bantus and Pygmies.
The earliest inhabitants of the region comprising present-day Congo were the
Bambuti people. The Bambuti were linked to Pygmy tribes whose Stone Age culture
was slowly replaced by Bantu tribes coming from regions north of present-day
Democratic Republic of the Congo about 2,000 years ago, introducing Iron Age
culture to the region. The main Bantu tribe living in the region were the
Kongo, also known as Bakongo, who established mostly weak and unstable kingdoms
along the mouth, north and south of the Congo River. The capital of this
Kongolese kingdom, Mbanza Kongo, later baptized as S√£o Salvador by the
Portuguese, is a town in northern Angola near the border with the DRC. From the
capital they ruled over an empire encompassing large parts of present-day
Angola, the Republic of Congo and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Ruling over
nearby tributary states often by appointing sons of the Kongo kings to head
these states. It had six so-called provinces called Mbemba, Soyo, Mbamba,
Mbata, Nsundi and Mpangu. With the Kingdom of Loango in the north and the
Kingdom of Mbundu in the south being tributary states. In the East it bordered
on the Kwango river, a tributary of the Congo River. In total the kingdom is
said to have had 3 to 4 million inhabitants and a surface of about
300,000¬ km¬≤. According to oral traditions it was established in around 1400
when King Lukena Lua Nimi conquered the kingdom of Kabunga and established
Mbanza Kongo as its capital. Portuguese exploration. This African Iron Age
culture came under great pressure with the arrival of the first Europeans,
being in this case the Portuguese explorers. In Portugal, King John II said in
order to break Venetian and Ottoman control over trade with the East, they
needed to organise a series of expeditions southwards along the African coast
with the idea of establishing direct contacts with Asia. In 1482‚Äì1483,
Captain Diogo C√£o, sailing southwards on uncharted Congo River, discovered the
mouth of the river, and became the first European to encounter the Kingdom of
Kongo. In the beginning relations were limited and considered beneficial to
both sides. With Christianity easily being accepted by the local nobility,
leading on 3 May 1491 to the baptizing of king Nzinga a Nkuwu as the first
Christian Kongolese king Jo√£o I. Being replaced after his death in 1506 by his
son Nzinga Mbemba who ruled as king Afonso I until 1543. Under his reign
Christianity gained a strong foothold in the country with many churches being
built in Mbanza of which the Kulumbimbi Cathedral (erected between 1491 and
1534) being the most impressive. In theory both the kings of Portugal and Kongo
were considered equals exchanging letters as such. Kongo at some point even
established diplomatic relations with the Vatican, with the Pope appointing a
local as bishop for the region. Slave trade. Relations between both kingdoms
deteriorated rapidly after 1510. The discovery of Brazil in 1500 and the need
for labor to work on the Portuguese plantations in Brazil, Cape Verde and S√£o
Tom√© led Portugal to look for more slaves. As the Portuguese's demand for
black slaves grew, the pressure on the Kongo kings increased. With the Kongo
king Afonso I complaining in 1526 to his Portuguese counterpart, John III,
bitterly of the damage done to his kingdom by this trade, which was
depopulating whole areas and leading to constant wars with his neighbors. At
some point even members of the royal family were taken and deported as slaves
to work on these plantations. It is estimated that by the end of the 18th
century European traders took about 350,000 slaves from the region of the
present-day Republic of Congo. Revolts. The result was a series of revolts
against Portuguese rule of which the battle of Mbwila and the revolt led by
Kimpa Vita (Tchimpa Vita) were the most important. The Battle of Mbwila (or
Battle of Ambouilla or Battle of Ulanga) was the result of a conflict between
the Portuguese led by governor Andr√© Vidal de Negreiros and the Kongolese king
Ant√≥nio I concerning mining rights. With the Kongolese refusing to give the
Portuguese extra territorial rights and the Portuguese angry because of
Kongolese support for previous Dutch invasions of the region. During the battle
on 25 October 1665 an estimated 20,000 Kongolese fought against the Portuguese
who won the battle thanks to the early death in battle of the Kongolese king
Ant√≥nio I. The revolt of Kimpa Vita was another attempt to regain independence
from the Portuguese. Baptised around 1684 as Dona B√©atrice, Kimpa Vita was
raised Catholic and being very pious she became a nun seeing visions of St.
Anthony of Padua ordering her to restore the kingdom of Kongo to its former
glory. Creating the Anthonian prophetic movement she interfered directly in the
then civil war between the three members of the local nobility claiming the
Kongolese throne, Jo√£o II, Pedro IV and Pedro Kibenga. In it she took sides
against Pedro IV, considered the favorite of the Portuguese. Her revolt, during
which she captured the capital Mbanza Kongo, was short lived. She was captured
by the forces of Pedro IV and under orders of Portuguese Capuchin Friars
condemned for being a witch and a heretic and consequently burned to death. For
many African Niger nationalists she is the African version of Joan of Arc and
an early symbol of African resistance against colonialism. Kongo's
disintegration. As a result of all these wars the kingdom of the Loango in the
north gained independence from Kongo. Also new kingdoms came to existence of
which the T√©k√© was the most important, ruling over a large area encompassing
present-day Brazzaville and Kinshasa. Portugal's position in Europe suffered a
major change in 1580 when the Kingdoms of Spain and Portugal were united by a
personal union under King Philip, creating the Iberian Union which lasted until
1640. This resulted in a diminished role for Portugal in African affairs,
including the area around the mouth of the Congo River. The Kingdom of Kongo
was reduced to a small enclave in the north of Angola with King Pedro V in 1888
finally accepting to become a vassal of the Portuguese. The Portuguese
abolished the kingdom after the revolt of the Kongolese in 1914. French rule.
Scramble for raw materials. The period leading up to the Berlin Conference on
Africa saw a rush by the major European powers to increase their control of the
African continent. The rise in Western Europe of capitalism and the consequent
industrialization led to a fast growing demand for African raw materials like
rubber, palm oil and cotton. Those who had these raw materials could have their
economy grow strong. Others would lose out. This resulted in a new and more
intensified scramble for Africa. The Congo River hereby was a prime target for
this new conquest by the European nations. Here the French, the Belgian King
Leopold II and the Portuguese, in close cooperation with the British, fought
for control of this area. Resulting in the division of the mouth of the Congo
River between Portugal, who obtained Cabinda, an enclave north of the Congo
River situated on the Atlantic Coast, the French who seized the large area
north of the River, and king Leopold II gaining only a small foothold at the
mouth of the Congo River but obtaining the huge hinterland, the present-day
Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire). Hereby Leopold II obtained
control via his International African Society and later the International
Congolese Society, so-called philanthropic organizations who hired the British
explorer Henry Morton Stanley to establish its authority. This resulted in the
creation of the Congo Free State, the private empire of Leopold II. On November
15, 1908 the Belgian parliament annexed the colony, the reign of Leopold II
over Congo being discredited. Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza. On the north bank of
the river arrived the French explorer Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza, born in the
Italian city of Rome in 1852. As a French naval officer he refused to work for
the International African Society and instead helped the French in their
conquest of the area north of the Congo River. Traveling from the Atlantic
Ocean coast in present-day Gabon via the rivers Ogoou√© and Lefini he arrived
in 1880 in the kingdom of the T√©k√© where on 10 September 1880 he signed the
treaty with king Makoko establishing French control over the region and making
his capital soon afterwards at the small village named Mfoa later to be called
Brazzaville. Establishing control. Establishing French control was difficult.
Belgian King Leopold II also tried to gain a foothold on the northern bank of
the Congo River and send Stanley to the area around Brazzaville. Following this
was a series of revolts against the French of which the Bahangala Revolt led by
Mabiala Ma Nganga was the first important one. It started in 1892 with the
murder of the French administrator Laval and ended with the killing by the
French of its leader in 1896. Many of the revolts were the result of French
policy of maltreating the local population as with the introduction of forced
labor. In fact the locals lost their entire rights through the Code de
l'indig√©nat Act. A law, which introduced forced labor, made it illegal for the
local population to publicly air its grievances and excluded them from all the
important jobs. Because the French government did not want to spend too much
money on its colony it allowed for the establishment of the so-called
Concessionary Companies, monopolies given a free hand to exploit the colony's
resources except at a few strategic places, mainly around the Congo River. Most
of these companies failed because of a shortage of funds. In 1911 parts of the
colony (the so-called New Cameroon territories) were ceded to the German Empire
in exchange for German recognition of France's rights to Morocco. The German
rule lasted only five years. New Cameroon returned to France in 1916, after the
fall of German forces in Africa. French rule was brutal and led to many
thousands of deaths. The construction between 1921 and 1934 of the 511¬ km long
railway, the Chemin de Fer Congo-Oc√©an between Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire is
for example said to have cost the lives of around 23,000 locals and a few
hundred Europeans. Any resistance against French colonial rule, however small,
was brutally repressed. French administration. The first name given officially
on 1 August 1886 for the new colony was Colony of Gabon and Congo. On 30 April
1891 this was renamed Colony of French Congo, consisting of Gabon and Middle
Congo, the name the French gave to Congo-Brazzaville at that time. On 15
January 1910 the colony again was renamed to French Equatorial Africa (Afrique
Equatoriale Fran√ßaise or AEF), this time it also included Chad and Oubangui-
Chari, nowadays the Central African Republic. Congo-Brazzaville gained autonomy
on the November 28, 1958 and independence from France on the August 15, 1960.
The French government ruled it through a Governor-General until the elections
of 1957 when a High Commissioner of the R√©publique took over. Ruling as
Colonial Heads of French Equatorial Africa Total population in 1950 for the
whole AEF was 4,143,922, except for around 15,000 al of them indigenous people.
The capital of the AEF was Brazzaville, for Middle Congo the capital was Pointe
Noire. 1940s. World War II. As with the arrival of the Portuguese events in
Europe again had a deep impact on the affairs of Congo-Brazzaville, and Africa
in general. Marshal Philippe P√©tain surrendered to Germany on 22 June 1940,
and this gave birth to the so-called Vichy France republic. P√©tain had earlier
refused to continue the war against Germany from African territory alongside
Great Britain. With the help of a handful of local French administrators and
officers, the British, and the Belgian government in exile Charles de Gaulle's
Free French won over large parts of the French Empire. Politicians such as
Ren√© Pleven, who later became Prime Minister, and officers as General Philippe
Leclerc de Hauteclocque, Lieutenant Ren√© Amiot, Captain Raymond Delange,
Colonel Edgar De Larminat and Adolphe Sic√© helped him to gain control of the
AEF territory. In three days troops loyal to De Gaulle took control of Chad (26
August 1940), Cameroon (27 August) and of Middle Congo (the 28th of August).
Brazzaville hereby became the capital of the so-called Free French in Africa,
ruled in theory by a Conseil de d√©fense de l'Empire set up by De Gaulle on 27
October 1940. Felix Ebou√©. In this revolt the then-governor of Chad F√©lix
Ebou√© played a key role. Because of this and his earlier support for De Gaulle
he became Governor General of the Afrique Equatoriale Fran√ßaise (AEF) in 1940,
the first not white to achieve this position in French colonial history. Born
in 1884 in French Guiana this descendant of African slaves was a key figure
together with Ren√© Pleven in the organization by the De Gaulle government of
the Brazzaville Conference of 1944, which took place between the January 30 and
February 8, 1944 and which did set out the new direction of French colonial
policies after World War II. Policies already put forward by Ebou√© in his 1941
book entitled "La nouvelle politique coloniale de l'A.E.F." This conference led
to the abolition of forced labor and the code de l'indig√©nat, which made the
political and social activities of the indigenous people illegal. This in turn
led to the new French constitution of the Fourth Republic approved on 27
October 1946 and the election of the first African members of Parliament in
Paris. For Ebou√© and the new French government the people in the colonies were
officially part of the French empire and had a new series of rights. A severely
weakened France, under pressure from the US, had hardly any option but to
change its colonial policies. Rise of nationalism. Governor General Felix
Ebou√© had a carrot and stick approach to local Congolese grievances. While
allowing certain freedoms he brutally repressed any activities deemed dangerous
to French colonial control. The case of the Congolese trade unionist Andr√©
Matsoua (Matswa) shows his tough approach to political dissent. Andr√© Matsoua
can be seen as the father of modern Congolese nationalism. His rise shows how,
in spite of the Code de l'Indig√©nat and the brutal repression, Africans in
French colonies were able to set up resistance movements to colonial rule.
Local schools run by French missionaries, as elsewhere in Africa formed the
basis of this rise of African nationalism. Andr√© Matsoua got his education and
contacts with European thinking through the church. Born in 1899 in Mandzakala
he joined the French customs administration in Brazzaville in 1919 and soon
after left for France where he joined the French army to fight in Morocco
during the rebellion of . He returned home as a non-commissioned officer. In
1926 he in Paris formed the Association des Originaires de l'A.E.F. with the
purpose of helping people from his region living in France. For this he got
support from some sections of French society as the French Communist Party and
elements within the Free Masonry movement. When in 1929 his group also became
active in Congo itself and demanded an end to the Code de l'Indig√©nat, things
changed. In 1929 the French dissolved Matsoua's association and he together
with some of his friends were jailed and sent in exile to Chad, leading to
riots and a campaign of disobedience against the French administration lasting
many years. He however escaped to France in 1935 where under a new identity he
continued his political work. Showing his loyalty to France, in spite of the
harsh repression, he joined the French army to fighting the German invasion in
1940. Wounded, he was rearrested, and sent back to Brazzaville where on 8
February 1941 he was sentenced under Felix Ebou√© to work in labor camps for
the rest of his life. He died under unclear circumstances in prison on 13
January 1942. His supporters maintain that he was murdered, and began the
Matsouanist movement, active chiefly among the Lari, even after independence.
Road to independence. The most prominent Congolese politician until 1956 was
Jean-F√©lix Tchicaya, born in Libreville on 9 November 1903 and a member of the
royal family of the Kingdom of Loango. Together with Ivorian leader F√©lix
Houphou√´t-Boigny and others, he formed the Rassemblement D√©mocratique
Africain (RDA) in 1946 and, in 1947, the Parti Progressiste Africain. On 21
November 1945, Tchicaya became one of the first African leaders elected to the
French parliament, giving him great prestige in his native country. Although
Tchicaya was on the left of the French political spectrum, he never strongly
questioned French colonial rule. This resulted in a loss of influence as the
Congo prepared for independence, influenced by nationalist anti-colonial
leaders as Kwame Nkrumah from Ghana and Egyptian President Gamel Abdel Nasser.
Only by aligning himself with his erstwhile enemy, the more radical Jacques
Opangault in the parliamentary elections of March 31, 1957 could he continue to
play a leading role in Congolese political life. Prior to independence, the
French establishment and Catholic Church feared Opangault's radicalism and
favored the rise of Fulbert Youlou, a former priest. The defection of Georges
Yambot from the African Socialist Movement (MSA) to Youlou's Union
D√©mocratique pour la D√©fense d'Int√©r√™ts Africains (UDDIA) helped Youlou
become Prime Minister in 1958. This led to the establishment of the Republic of
Congo on 28 November 1958 (with Brazzaville replacing Point Noire as the
country's capital). On 16 February 1959, a revolt organized by Opangault and
his MSA erupted in clashes along tribal lines between Southerners, supporting
Youlou, and people from the North, loyal to the MSA. The riots were suppressed
by French army and Opangault was arrested. In total about 200 people died.
Prime Minister Youlou then held the elections for which Opangault had
previously asked in vain. After the May 9 arrest of several politicians,
including veteran politician Simon Kikhounga Ngot, because of an alleged
communist plot, parliamentary elections were convincingly won by Youlou. On 12
July 1960 France agreed to Congo becoming fully independent. On 15 August 1960,
the Republic of Congo became an independent country and Fulbert Youlou became
its first President. In November that year, Youlou released Opangault, Ngot and
other adversaries, as part of an amnesty. In return both politicians, as well
as Germain Bicoumat, joined Youlou's government and received ministerial posts,
effectively destroying any organized political opposition. Oil. Shortly before
gaining independence an event occurred that in the years to come would have
deep influence on the country and its relations with the outside world, mainly
France. In 1957 near Pointe Indienne the French Societ√© des P√©troles de
l'Afrique Equatoriale Fran√ßaises (SPAEF) found oil and gas reserves offshore
in sufficient exploitable quantities. Although French geologists already in
1926 established for certain the presence of oil and gas in the country only
then France started exploiting these reserves. The reason was that in Algeria a
war of independence was fought the French were losing. And Algeria until then
was the main source of oil and gas destined for the French market. To remain
independent of the American and British oil majors France had to look elsewhere
for its supply. For some the discovery of oil of the Congolese coast was a
blessing. For the majority of the local population it rather proved to be a
curse as the International Monetary Fund in its yearly reports on the country a
few years ago sadly observed. Les Trois Glorieuses and the 1968 Coup d'√©tat.
As Brazzaville had been the capital of the large federation of French
Equatorial Africa, it had an important workforce and lots of trade unions.
Further radicalization elsewhere in Africa as a result of the decolonization
led to revolt against the dictatorial rule of Youlou. Following Youlou's 6
August 1960 announcement of the formation of a one-party state with only one
legal trade union, trade unions started their revolt on the 13th of August.
Youlou's palace was besieged on the 15th by angry workers and the French
refused to intervene militarily, and he was forced to resign. This uprising is
known as Les Trois Glorieuses (the Three Glorious Days), named after the French
July Revolution against King Charles X in 1830. Fulbert Youlou and his main
supporters were arrested by the military and ceased to play any further role in
Congolese political life. The Congolese military took charge of the country
briefly and installed a civilian provisional government headed by Alphonse
Massamba-D√©bat. Under the 1963 constitution, Massamba-D√©bat was elected
President for a 5-year term and named Pascal Lissouba to serve as Prime
Minister. President Massamba-D√©bat's term ended in August 1968 when Captain
Marien Ngouabi and other army officers toppled the government in a coup. After
a period of consolidation under the newly formed National Revolutionary
Council, Ngouabi assumed the presidency on December 31, 1968. One year later,
President Ngouabi proclaimed the People's Republic of the Congo, Africa's first
People's Republic and announced the decision of the National Revolutionary
Movement to change its name to the Congolese Party of Labour (PCT).
Assassination of Ngouabi and election of Sassou-Nguesso. On March 18, 1977
President Ngouabi was assassinated. A number of people were accused of shooting
Ngouabi tried and some of them executed, including former President Alphonse
Massemba-D√©bat, but there was little evidence to prove their involvement, and
the motive behind the assassination remains unclear. An 11-member Military
Committee of the Party (CMP) was named to head an interim government with Col.
(later Gen.) Joachim Yhombi-Opango to serve as President of the Republic. After
two years in power, Yhombi-Opango was accused of corruption and deviation from
party directives, and removed from office on February 5, 1979, by the Central
Committee of the PCT, which then simultaneously designated Vice President and
Defense Minister Col. Denis Sassou-Nguesso as interim President. The Central
Committee directed Sassou-Nguesso to take charge of preparations for the Third
Extraordinary Congress of the PCT, which proceeded to elect him President of
the Central Committee and President of the Republic. Under a congressional
resolution, Yhombi-Opango was stripped of all powers, rank, and possessions and
placed under arrest to await trial for high treason. He was released from house
arrest in late 1984 and ordered back to his native village of Owando. Democracy
and civil war. After decades of turbulent politics bolstered by Marxist-
Leninist rhetoric, and with the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Congolese
gradually moderated their economic and political views to the point that, in
1992, Congo completed a transition to multi-party democracy. Ending a long
history of one-party Marxist rule, a specific agenda for this transition was
laid out during Congo's national conference of 1991 and culminated in August
1992 with multi-party parliamentary and presidential elections. Sassou Nguesso
conceded defeat and Congo's new president, Professor Pascal Lissouba, was
inaugurated on August 31, 1992. Congolese democracy experienced severe trials
in 1993 and early 1994. The President dissolved the National Assembly in
November 1992, calling for new elections in May 1993. The results of those
elections were disputed, touching off violent civil unrest in June and again in
November. In February 1994 the decisions of an international board of arbiters
were accepted by all parties, and the risk of large-scale insurrection
subsided. Mr. Lissouba lost favour with the French government early in his
presidency by asking the American-owned Occidental Petroleum company to provide
financial support for his Government in exchange for promises of future oil
production. As the French company Elf Aquitaine (which reaped much of its
profits from the Republic of the Congo) had only just recently opened a large
deep-water oil platform off the coast of Pointe-Noire. Mr. Lissouba was
pressured by the French into canceling all contracts with Occidental Petroleum,
but suspicions of Lissouba remained. However, Congo's democratic progress
derailed in 1997. As presidential elections scheduled for July 1997 approached,
tensions between the Lissouba and Sassou Nguesso camps mounted. In May, a visit
by Sassou Nguesso to Owando, Joachim Yhombi-Opango's political stronghold, led
to the outbreak of violence between their supporters. On June 5, 1997,
government forces surrounded Sassou Nguesso's home in the Mpila section of
Brazzaville, attempting to arrest two men, Pierre Aboya and Engobo Bonaventure,
who had been implicated in the earlier violence. Fighting broke out between the
government forces and Sassou Nguesso's fighters, called Cobras, igniting a 4-
month conflict that destroyed or damaged much of Brazzaville. Lissouba traveled
throughout southern and central Africa in September, asking the governments of
Rwanda, Uganda, and Namibia for assistance. Laurent Kabila, the new-President
of the Democratic Republic of Congo, sent hundreds of troops into Brazzaville
to fight on Lissouba's behalf. Angola supported Sassou Nguesso with about 1,000
Angolan tanks, troops. Support by the sympathetic French government further
bolstered Sassou Nguesso's rebels. Together these forces took Brazzaville and
Pointe-Noire in the morning of October 16. Lissouba fled the capital while his
soldiers surrendered and citizens began looting. Yhombi-Opango supported
Lissouba during the war, serving as leader of the Presidential Majority, and
after Sassou Nguesso's victory he fled into exile in C√¥te d'Ivoire and France.
Soon thereafter, Sassou Nguesso declared himself President and named a 33-
member government. In January 1998 the Sassou Nguesso regime held a National
Forum for Reconciliation to determine the nature and duration of the transition
period. The Forum, tightly controlled by the government, decided elections
should be held in about 3 years, elected a transition advisory legislature, and
announced that a constitutional convention will finalize a draft constitution.
However, the eruption in late 1998 of fighting between Sassou Nguesso's
government forces and an armed opposition disrupted the transitional return to
democracy. This new violence also closed the economically vital Congo-Ocean
Railway, caused great destruction and loss of life in southern Brazzaville and
in the Pool, Bouenza, and Niari regions, and displaced hundreds of thousands of
persons. In November and December 1999, the government signed agreements with
representatives of many, though not all, of the rebel groups. The December
accord, mediated by President Omar Bongo of Gabon, called for follow-on,
inclusive political negotiations between the government and the opposition.
2000s. Sassou won elections in 2002 with an implausible 90% or so of the votes.
His two main rivals, Lissouba and Bernard Kolelas, were prevented from
competing and the only remaining credible rival, Andr√© Milongo, boycotted the
elections and withdrew from the race due to, among other reasons, perceived
voter fraud on the part of Sassou. A new constitution was agreed upon in
January 2002, granting the president new powers and extending his term to seven
years as well as introducing a new bicameral assembly. On December 30, twenty
opposition political parties issued a statement through spokesman Chistope
Ngokaka, saying Sassou's government had purchased "weapons and military
craft... under contracts signed between the officials in Brazzaville and the
government in Beijing." Congo's next presidential election is set for July
2009. Five candidates have formally announced their intention to run in the
election and President Sassou is expected to run for another term.
