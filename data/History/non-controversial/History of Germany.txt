History of Germany The concept of Germany as a distinct region in central
Europe can be traced to Roman commander Julius Caesar, who referred to the
unconquered area east of the Rhine as "Germania", thus distinguishing it from
Gaul (France), which he had conquered. The victory of the Germanic tribes in
the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest (AD 9) prevented annexation by the Roman
Empire. Following the fall of the Roman Empire, the Franks conquered the other
West Germanic tribes. When the Frankish Empire was divided among Charlemagne's
heirs in 843, the eastern part became East Francia. In 962, Otto I became the
first emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, the medieval German state. In the High
Middle Ages, the dukes and princes of the empire gained power at the expense of
the emperors. Martin Luther led the Protestant Reformation against the Catholic
Church after 1517, as the northern states became Protestant, while the southern
states remained Catholic. The two parts of the Holy Roman Empire clashed in the
Thirty Years' War (1618â€“1648), which was ruinous to the twenty million
civilians. 1648 marked the effective end of the Holy Roman Empire and the
beginning of the modern nation-state system, with Germany divided into numerous
independent states, such as Prussia, Bavaria and Saxony. After the French
Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars (1803â€“1815), feudalism fell away and
liberalism and nationalism clashed with reaction. The 1848 March Revolution
failed. The Industrial Revolution modernized the German economy, led to the
rapid growth of cities and to the emergence of the Socialist movement in
Germany. Prussia, with its capital Berlin, grew in power. German universities
became world-class centers for science and the humanities, while music and the
arts flourished. Unification was achieved with the formation of the German
Empire in 1871 under the leadership of Prussian Chancellor Otto von Bismarck.
The Reichstag, an elected parliament, had only a limited role in the imperial
government. By 1900, Germany's economy matched Britain's, allowing colonial
expansion and a naval race. Germany led the Central Powers in the First World
War (1914â€“1918) against France, Great Britain, Russia and (by 1917) the
United States. Defeated and partly occupied, Germany was forced to pay war
reparations by the Treaty of Versailles and was stripped of its colonies as
well as Polish areas and Alsace-Lorraine. The German Revolution of 1918â€“19
deposed the emperor and the kings, leading to the establishment of the Weimar
Republic, an unstable parliamentary democracy. In the early 1930s, the
worldwide Great Depression hit Germany hard, as unemployment soared and people
lost confidence in the government. In 1933, the Nazis under Adolf Hitler came
to power and established a totalitarian regime. Political opponents were killed
or imprisoned. Nazi Germany's aggressive foreign policy took control of Austria
and parts of Czechoslovakia, and its invasion of Poland initiated the Second
World War. After forming a pact with the Soviet Union in 1939, Hitler's
blitzkrieg swept nearly all of Western Europe. The systematic genocide program
known as The Holocaust killed six million Jews in Germany and German-occupied
areas, as well as five million Poles, Romanies, Slavs, Soviets, and others. In
1941, however, the German invasion of the Soviet Union failed, and after the
United States entered the war, Britain became the base for massive Anglo-
American bombings of German cities. Germany fought the war on multiple fronts
through 1942â€“1943. Following the Allied invasion of Normandy (June 1944), the
German army was pushed back on all fronts until the final collapse in May 1945.
Under occupation by the Allies, German territories were split off,
denazification took place, and the Cold War resulted in the division of the
country into democratic West Germany and communist East Germany. Millions of
ethnic Germans fled from Communist areas into West Germany, which experienced
rapid economic expansion, and became the dominant economy in Western Europe.
West Germany was rearmed in the 1950s under the auspices of NATO, but without
access to nuclear weapons. The Franco-German friendship became the basis for
the political integration of Western Europe in the European Union. In 1989, the
Eastern Bloc collapsed and East Germany was reunited with West Germany in 1990.
In 1998â€“1999, Germany was one of the founding countries of the Eurozone.
Germany remains one of the economic powerhouses of Europe, contributing about
one quarter of the Eurozone's annual gross domestic product. In 2012 Germany
played a critical role in trying to resolve the escalating Euro crisis,
especially regarding Greece and other Southern nations. "For more events, see
Timeline of German historyâ€Ž Germanic tribes, 750 BC-768 AD. Migration and
conquest. The ethnogenesis of the Germanic tribes is assumed to have occurred
during the Nordic Bronze Age, or at the latest during the Pre-Roman Iron Age.
From southern Scandinavia and northern Germany, the tribes began expanding
south, east and west in the 1st centuryÂ BC, coming into contact with the
Celtic tribes of Gaul, as well as Iranian, Baltic, and Slavic tribes in Central
Europe. Little is known about early Germanic history, except through their
recorded interactions with the Roman Empire, etymological research and
archaeological finds. In the first years of the 1st century, Roman legions
conducted a long campaign in Germania, the area north of the Upper Danube and
east of the Rhine, in an attempt to expand the Empire's frontiers and shorten
its frontier line. They subdued several Germanic tribes, such as the Cherusci.
The tribes became familiar with Roman tactics of warfare while maintaining
their tribal identity. In 9 AD, a Cherusci chieftain named Arminius defeated a
Roman army in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest, a victory credited with
stopping the Roman advance into Germanic territories and forming the birth of
German history. Modern Germany, east of the Rhine, remained outside the Roman
Empire. By ADÂ 100, the time of Tacitus's "Germania", Germanic tribes settled
along the Roman frontier at the Rhine and the Danube (the "Limes Germanicus"),
occupying most of the area of modern Germany; however, Austria, southern
Bavaria, and the western Rhineland were Roman provinces. The 3rd century saw
the emergence of a number of large West Germanic tribes: Alamanni, Franks,
Bavarii, Chatti, Saxons, Frisii, Sicambri, and Thuringii. Around 260, the
Germanic peoples broke through the "Limes" and the Danube frontier into Roman-
controlled lands. Seven large German-speaking tribes â€“ the Visigoths,
Ostrogoths, Vandals, Burgundians, Lombards, Saxons and Franks â€“ moved west
and took part in the Decline of the Roman Empire and transformation of the old
Western Roman Empire. The unoccupied part of present Germany was invaded by the
Huns at the end of the 4th century and led to the beginning of the Migration
Period. Hunnic hegemony of Germany lasted until 469. The Stem Duchies and
Marches. Stem Duchies (tribal duchies) in Germany were mainly the areas of the
old German tribes of the region, especially in the east. In the 5th century,
the "VÃ¶lkerwanderung" (or Germanic migrations) brought a number of Barbarian
tribes into the failing Roman Empire. Tribes that became stem duchies were
originally the Alamanni, the Thuringii, the Saxons, the Franks, the
Burgundians, and the Rugii. In contrast to later duchies, these entities were
not defined by strict administrative boundaries but by the area of settlement
of major Germanic tribes. Over the next few centuries, some tribes warred,
migrated, and merged. All these tribes in Germania were eventually subjugated
by the Franks. However, remnants of several stem duchies survive today as
states or regions in modern Western Europe countries: German states such as
Bavaria and Saxony, German regions like Swabia, and French "rÃ©gion"s such as
of Burgundy, and Lorraine. Germans in the east also founded a series of border
counties or Marches. To the north, these included Lusatia, the North March that
would become Brandenburg and the heart of Prussia, and the Billung March. In
the south, the marches included Carniola, Styria, and the March of Austria that
would become Austria. Frankish Empire. After the fall of the Western Roman
Empire, the Franks created an empire under the Merovingian kings and subjugated
the other Germanic tribes. The Merovingian kings of the Germanic Franks
conquered northern Gaul in 486 AD. Swabia became a duchy under the Frankish
Empire in 496, following the Battle of Tolbiac; in 530 Saxons and Franks
destroyed the Kingdom of Thuringia. In the 5th and 6th centuries the
Merovingian kings conquered several other Germanic tribes and kingdoms. King
Chlothar I (558â€“561) ruled the greater part of what is now Germany and made
expeditions into Saxony, while the Southeast of modern Germany was still under
influence of the Ostrogoths. Saxons inhabited the area down to the Unstrut
River. Regions of the Frankish Empire were placed under the control of
autonomous dukes of mixed Frankish and native blood. Frankish Colonists were
encouraged to move to the newly conquered territories. While the local Germanic
tribes were allowed to preserve their laws, they were pressured into becoming
Christians. The German territories became part of Austrasia (meaning "eastern
land"), the northeastern portion of the Kingdom of the Merovingian Franks. As a
whole, Austrasia comprised parts of present day France, Germany, Belgium,
Luxembourg and the Netherlands. After the death of the Frankish king Clovis I
in 511, his four sons partitioned his kingdom including Austrasia. Authority
over Austrasia passed back and forth from autonomy to kingly subjugation, as
Frankish lands were alternately united and subdivided by the Merovingian kings.
In 718, Charles Martel, the Franconian Mayor of the Palace, made war against
Saxony because of its help for the Neustrians. His son Carloman started a new
war against Saxony in 743, because the Saxons gave aid to Duke Odilo of
Bavaria. In 751 Pippin III, Mayor of the Palace under the Merovingian king,
himself assumed the title of king and was anointed by the Church. Now the
Frankish kings were set up as protectors of the pope, and Charles the Great
launched a decades-long military campaign against their heathen rivals, the
Saxons and the Avars. The campaigns and insurrections of the Saxon Wars lasted
from 772 to 804. The Saxons and Avars were eventually overwhelmed, the people
were forcibly converted to Christianity, and the lands were annexed by the
Carolingian Empire. Middle Ages. Charlemagne. After the 768 death of Frankish
King Pepin the Short, his son Charles consolidated his control over his kingdom
and became known as "Charles the Great" or "Charlemagne." From 771 until his
death in 814, Charlemagne extended the Carolingian empire into northern Italy
and the territories of all west Germanic peoples, including the Saxons and the
Bajuwari (Bavarians). In 800, Charlemagne's authority was confirmed by his
coronation as Holy Roman Emperor by the pope on Christmas Day in Rome. Imperial
strongholds ("Kaiserpfalzen") became economic and cultural centres, of which
Aachen was the most famous. Fighting among Charlemagne's grandchildren caused
the Carolingian empire to be partitioned into several parts by the Treaty of
Verdun (843), the Treaty of Meerssen (870), and the Treaty of Ribemont. The
German region developed out of the East Frankish kingdom, East Francia. From
919 to 936, the Germanic peoples â€“ Franks, Saxons, Swabians, and Bavarians
â€“ were united under Henry the Fowler, Duke of Saxony, who took the title of
king. For the first time, the term "Kingdom (Empire) of the Germans" ("Regnum
Teutonicorum") was applied to a Frankish kingdom, although "Teutonicorum" at
its founding originally meant something closer to "Realm of the Germanic
peoples" or "Germanic Realm" than "realm of the Germans". Otto the Great. In
936, Otto I the Great was crowned as king at Aachen; his coronation as emperor
by the Pope at Rome in 962 inaugurated what became later known as the Holy
Roman Empire, which became to be identified with Germany. Otto strengthened the
royal authority by re-asserting the old Carolingian rights over ecclesiastical
appointments. Otto wrested from the nobles the powers of appointment of the
bishops and abbots, who controlled large land holdings. Additionally, Otto
revived the old Carolingian program of appointing missionaries in the border
lands. Otto continued to support celibacy for the higher clergy, so
ecclesiastical appointments never became hereditary. By granting land to the
abbotts and bishops he appointed, Otto actually made these bishops into
"princes of the Empire" ("ReichsfÃ¼rsten"); in this way, Otto was able to
establish a national church. Outside threats to the kingdom were contained with
the decisive defeat of the Hungarian Magyars at the Battle of Lechfeld in 955.
The Slavs between the Elbe and the Oder rivers were also subjugated. Otto
marched on Rome and drove John XII from the papal throne and for years
controlled the election of the pope, setting a firm precedent for imperial
control of the papacy for years to come. During the reign of Conrad II's son,
Henry III (1039 to 1056), the empire supported the Cluniac reforms of the
Church â€“ the Peace of God, prohibition of simony (the purchase of clerical
offices), and required celibacy of priests. Imperial authority over the Pope
reached its peak. In the Investiture Controversy which began between Henry IV
and Pope Gregory VII over appointments to ecclesiastical offices, the emperor
was compelled to submit to the Pope at Canossa in 1077, after having been
excommunicated. In 1122 a temporary reconciliation was reached between Henry V
and the Pope with the Concordat of Worms. The consequences of the investiture
dispute were a weakening of the Ottonian church ("Reichskirche"), and a
strengthening of the Imperial secular princes. The time between 1096 and 1291
was the age of the crusades. Knightly religious orders were established,
including the Knights Templar, the Knights of St John (Knights Hospitaller),
and the Teutonic Order. The term "sacrum imperium" (Holy Empire) was first used
under Friedrich I, documented first in 1157. Hanseatic League. Long-distance
trade in the Baltic intensified, as the major trading towns became drawn
together in the Hanseatic League, under the leadership of LÃ¼beck. The
Hanseatic League was a business alliance of trading cities and their guilds
that dominated trade along the coast of Northern Europe. Each of the Hanseatic
cities had its own legal system and a degree of political autonomy. The chief
cities were Cologne on the Rhine River, Hamburg and Bremen on the North Sea,
and LÃ¼beck on the Baltic. The League flourished from 1200 to 1500, and
continued with lesser importance after that. Eastward expansion. The German
colonisation and the chartering of new towns and villages began into largely
Slav-inhabited territories east of the Elbe, such as Bohemia, Silesia,
Pomerania, and Livonia. Beginning in 1226, the Teutonic Knights began their
conquest of Prussia. The native Baltic Prussians were conquered and
Christianized by the Knights with much warfare, and numerous German towns were
established along the eastern shore of the Baltic Sea. Church and state. Henry
V (1086â€“1125), great-grandson of Conrad II, became Holy Roman Emperor in 1106
in the midst of a civil war. Hoping to gain complete control over the church
inside the Empire, Henry V appointed Adalbert of SaarbrÃ¼cken as the powerful
archbishop of Mainz in 1111. Adalbert began to assert the powers of the Church
against secular authorities, that is, the Emperor. This precipitated the
"Crisis of 1111", part of the long-term Investiture Controversy. In 1137 the
magnates turned back to the Hohenstaufen family for a candidate, Conrad III.
Conrad III tried to divest Henry the Proud of his two duchies â€“ Bavaria and
Saxony â€“ leading to war in southern Germany as the Empire divided into two
factions. The first faction called themselves the "Welfs" or "Guelphs" after
Henry the Proud's family, which was the ruling dynasty in Bavaria; the other
faction was known as the "Waiblings." In this early period, the Welfs generally
represented ecclesiastical independence under the papacy plus "particularism"
(a strengthening of the local duchies against the central imperial authority).
The Waiblings, on the other hand, stood for control of the Church by a strong
central Imperial government. Between 1152 and 1190, during the reign of
Frederick I (Barbarossa), of the Hohenstaufen dynasty, an accommodation was
reached with the rival Guelph party by the grant of the duchy of Bavaria to
Henry the Lion, duke of Saxony. Austria became a separate duchy by virtue of
the Privilegium Minus in 1156. Barbarossa tried to reassert his control over
Italy. In 1177 a final reconciliation was reached between the emperor and the
Pope in Venice. In 1180, Henry the Lion was outlawed; Saxony was divided, and
Bavaria was given to Otto of Wittelsbach. (Otto founded the Wittelsbach
dynasty, which was to rule Bavaria until 1918.) From 1184 to 1186, the
Hohenstaufen empire under Frederick I Barbarossa reached its peak in the
"Reichsfest" (imperial celebrations) held at Mainz and the marriage of his son
Henry in Milan to the Norman princess Constance of Sicily. The power of the
feudal lords was undermined by the appointment of "ministerials" (unfree
servants of the Emperor) as officials. Chivalry and the court life flowered,
leading to a development of German culture and literature (see Wolfram von
Eschenbach). Between 1212 and 1250 Frederick II established a modern,
professionally administered state from his base in Sicily. He resumed the
conquest of Italy, leading to further conflict with the Papacy. In the Empire,
extensive sovereign powers were granted to ecclesiastical and secular princes,
leading to the rise of independent territorial states. The struggle with the
Pope sapped the Empire's strength, as Frederick II was excommunicated three
times. After his death, the Hohenstaufen dynasty fell, followed by an
interregnum during which there was no Emperor. The failure of negotiations
between Emperor Louis IV and the papacy led in 1338 to the declaration at
Rhense by six electors to the effect that election by all or the majority of
the electors automatically conferred the royal title and rule over the empire,
without papal confirmation. As result, the monarch was no longer subject to
papal approbation and became increasingly dependent on the favour of the
electors. Between 1346 and 1378 Emperor Charles IV of Luxembourg, king of
Bohemia, sought to restore the imperial authority. The Golden Bull of 1356
stipulated that in future the emperor was to be chosen by four secular electors
and three spiritual electors. The secular electors were the King of Bohemia,
the Count Palatine of the Rhine, the Duke of Saxony, and the Margrave of
Brandenburg; the three spiritual electors were the Archbishops of Mainz, Trier,
and Cologne. Around 1350 Germany and almost the whole of Europe were ravaged by
the Black Death. Jews were persecuted on religious and economic grounds; many
fled to Poland. The Black Death is estimated to have killed 30â€“60 percent of
Europe's population in the 14th century. Change and reform. After the disasters
of the 14th century â€“ war, plague, and schism â€“ early-modern European
society gradually came into being as a result of economic, religious, and
political changes. A money economy arose which provoked social discontent among
knights and peasants. Gradually, a proto-capitalistic system evolved out of
feudalism. The Fugger family gained prominence through commercial and financial
activities and became financiers to both ecclesiastical and secular rulers. The
knightly classes found their monopoly on arms and military skill undermined by
the introduction of mercenary armies and foot soldiers. Predatory activity by
"robber knights" became common. From 1438 the Habsburgs, who controlled most of
the southeast of the Empire (more or less modern-day Austria and Slovenia, and
Bohemia and Moravia after the death of King Louis II in 1526), maintained a
constant grip on the position of the Holy Roman Emperor until 1806 (with the
exception of the years between 1742 and 1745). This situation, however, gave
rise to increased disunity among the Holy Roman Empire's territorial rulers and
prevented sections of the country from coming together to form nations in the
manner of France and England. During his reign from 1493 to 1519, Maximilian I
tried to reform the Empire. An Imperial supreme court ("Reichskammergericht")
was established, imperial taxes were levied, and the power of the Imperial Diet
("Reichstag") was increased. The reforms, however, were frustrated by the
continued territorial fragmentation of the Empire. Towns and cities. The German
lands had a population of about 5 or 6 million. The great majority were
farmers, typically in a state of serfdom under the control of nobles and
monasteries. A few towns were starting to emerge. From 1100, new towns were
founded around imperial strongholds, castles, bishops' palaces, and
monasteries. The towns began to establish municipal rights and liberties (see
German town law). Several cities such as Cologne became Imperial Free Cities,
which did not depend on princes or bishops, but were immediately subject to the
Emperor. The towns were ruled by patricians: merchants carrying on long-
distance trade. Craftsmen formed guilds, governed by strict rules, which sought
to obtain control of the towns; a few were open to women. Society was divided
into sharply demarcated classes: the clergy, physicians, merchants, various
guilds of artisans, and peasants; full citizenship was not available to
paupers. Political tensions arose from issues of taxation, public spending,
regulation of business, and market supervision, as well as the limits of
corporate autonomy. Cologne's central location on the Rhine river placed it at
the intersection of the major trade routes between east and west and was the
basis of Cologne's growth. The economic structures of medieval and early modern
Cologne were characterized by the city's status as a major harbor and transport
hub upon the Rhine. It was the seat of the archbishops, who ruled the
surrounding area and (from 1248 to 1880) built the great Cologne Cathedral,
with sacred relics that made it a destination for many worshippers. By 1288 the
city had secured its independence from the archbishop (who relocated to Bonn),
and was ruled by its burghers. Science and culture. In the 12th century, German
Benedictine abbess Hildegard von Bingen (1098â€“1179) wrote several influential
theological, botanical, and medicinal texts, as well as letters, liturgical
songs, poems, and arguably the oldest surviving morality play, while
supervising brilliant miniature Illuminations. Ca. 100 years later, Walther von
der Vogelweide (c. 1170-c. 1230) became the most celebrated of the Middle High
German lyric poets. Around 1439, Johannes Gutenberg, a citizen of Mainz, was
the first European to use movable type printing and became the global inventor
of the printing press, thereby starting the Printing Revolution. Gutenberg's
inventions and works (such as the Gutenberg Bible) would play key roles for the
development of the Reformation and the Scientific Revolution. Around the
transition from the 15th to the 16th century, Albrecht DÃ¼rer from Nuremberg
established his reputation across Europe as painter, printmaker, mathematician,
engraver, and theorist when he was still in his twenties and secured his
reputation as one of the most important figures of the Northern Renaissance.
The addition "Nationis GermanicÃ¦" (of German Nation) to the emperor's title
appeared first in the 15th century: in a 1486 law decreed by Friedrich III and
in 1512 in reference to the "Reichstag" in Cologne by Maximilian I. By then,
the emperors had lost their influence in Italy and Burgundy. In 1525, the
Heilbronn reform plan â€“ the most advanced document of the German Peasants'
War ("Deutscher Bauernkrieg") â€“ referred to the "Reich" as "von Teutscher
Nation" (of German nation). Early modern Germany. Reformation. In the early
16th century there was much discontent occasioned by abuses such as indulgences
in the Catholic Church, and a general desire for reform. In 1517 the
Reformation began with the publication of Martin Luther's 95 Theses; he had
posted them in the town square, and gave copies of them to German nobles, but
it is debated whether he nailed them to the church door in Wittenberg as is
commonly said. The list detailed 95 assertions Luther believed to show
corruption and misguidance within the Catholic Church. One often cited example,
though perhaps not Luther's chief concern, is a condemnation of the selling of
indulgences; another prominent point within the 95 Theses is Luther's
disagreement both with the way in which the higher clergy, especially the pope,
used and abused power, and with the very idea of the pope. In 1521 Luther was
outlawed at the Diet of Worms. But the Reformation spread rapidly, helped by
the Emperor Charles V's wars with France and the Turks. Hiding in the Wartburg
Castle, Luther translated the Bible from Latin to German, establishing the
basis of the German language. A curious fact is that Luther spoke a dialect
which had minor importance in the German language of that time. After the
publication of his Bible, his dialect suppressed the others and evolved into
what is now the modern German. In 1524 the German Peasants' War broke out in
Swabia, Franconia and Thuringia against ruling princes and lords, following the
preachings of Reformist priests. But the revolts, which were assisted by war-
experienced noblemen like GÃ¶tz von Berlichingen and Florian Geyer (in
Franconia), and by the theologian Thomas MÃ¼nzer (in Thuringia), were soon
repressed by the territorial princes. It is estimated that as many as 100,000
German peasants were massacred during the revolt, usually after the battles had
ended. With the protestation of the Lutheran princes at the "Reichstag" of
Speyer (1529) and rejection of the Lutheran "Augsburg Confession" at Augsburg
(1530), a separate Lutheran church emerged. From 1545 the Counter-Reformation
began in Germany. The main force was provided by the Jesuit order, founded by
the Spaniard Ignatius of Loyola. Central and northeastern Germany were by this
time almost wholly Protestant, whereas western and southern Germany remained
predominantly Catholic. In 1547, Holy Roman Emperor Charles V defeated the
Schmalkaldic League, an alliance of Protestant rulers. The Peace of Augsburg in
1555 brought recognition of the Lutheran faith. But the treaty also stipulated
that the religion of a state was to be that of its ruler (Cuius regio, eius
religio). In 1556 Charles V abdicated. The Habsburg Empire was divided, as
Spain was separated from the Imperial possessions. In 1608/1609 the Protestant
Union and the Catholic League were formed. Thirty Years War. From 1618 to 1648
the Thirty Years' War ravaged in the Holy Roman Empire. The causes were the
conflicts between Catholics and Protestants, the efforts by the various states
within the Empire to increase their power and the Catholic Emperor's attempt to
achieve the religious and political unity of the Empire. The immediate occasion
for the war was the uprising of the Protestant nobility of Bohemia against the
emperor, but the conflict was widened into a European War by the intervention
of King Christian IV of Denmark (1625â€“29), Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden
(1630â€“48) and France under Cardinal Richelieu. Germany became the main
theatre of war and the scene of the final conflict between France and the
Habsburgs for predominance in Europe. The fighting often was out of control,
with marauding bands of hundreds or thousands of starving soldiers spreading
plague, plunder, and murder. The armies that were under control moved back and
forth across the countryside year after year, levying heavy taxes on cities,
and seizing the animals and food stocks of the peasants without payment. The
enormous social disruption over three decades caused a dramatic decline in
population because of killings, disease, crop failures, declining birth rates
and random destruction, and the out-migration of terrified people. One estimate
shows a 38% drop from 16 million people in 1618 to 10 million by 1650, while
another shows "only" a 20% drop from 20 million to 16 million. The Altmark and
WÃ¼rttemberg regions especially hard hit. It took generations for Germany to
fully recover. The war ended in 1648 with the Peace of Westphalia. Alsace was
permanently lost to France, Pomerania was temporarily lost to Sweden, and the
Netherlands officially left the Empire. Imperial power declined further as the
states' rights were increased. Culture and literacy. The German population
reached about twenty million people, the great majority of whom were peasant
farmers. The Reformation was a triumph of literacy and the new printing press.
Luther's translation of the Bible into German was a decisive moment in the
spread of literacy, and stimulated as well the printing and distribution of
religious books and pamphlets. From 1517 onward religious pamphlets flooded
Germany and much of Europe. By 1530 over 10,000 publications are known, with a
total of ten million copies. The Reformation was thus a media revolution.
Luther strengthened his attacks on Rome by depicting a "good" against "bad"
church. From there, it became clear that print could be used for propaganda in
the Reformation for particular agendas. Reform writers used pre-Reformation
styles, clichÃ©s, and stereotypes and changed items as needed for their own
purposes. Especially effective were Luther's "Small Catechism", for use of
parents teaching their children, and "Larger Catechism," for pastors. Using the
German vernacular they expressed the Apostles' Creed in simpler, more personal,
Trinitarian language. Illustrations in the newly translated Bible and in many
tracts popularized Luther's ideas. Lucas Cranach the Elder (1472â€“1553), the
great painter patronized by the electors of Wittenberg, was a close friend of
Luther, and illustrated Luther's theology for a popular audience. He dramatized
Luther's views on the relationship between the Old and New Testaments, while
remaining mindful of Luther's careful distinctions about proper and improper
uses of visual imagery. Luther's German translation of the Bible was also
decisive for the German language and its evolution from Early New High German
to Modern Standard. His bible promoted the development of non-local forms of
language and exposed all speakers to forms of German from outside their own
area. Science. Decisive scientific developments took place during the 16th and
17th centuries, especially in the fields of astronomy, mathematics and physics.
In 1543, astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus from ToruÅ„ (Thorn) published his work
"De revolutionibus orbium coelestium" and became the first person to formulate
a comprehensive heliocentric cosmology that displaced the Earth from the center
of the universe. Almost 70 years after Copernicus's death and building on his
theories, astronomer Johannes Kepler from Stuttgart was a leader in the 17th
century scientific revolution. He is best known for his laws of planetary
motion. His works "Astronomia nova" and "Harmonices Mundi" were further
codified by later astronomers. These works also influenced contemporary Italian
scientist Galileo Galilei and provided one of the foundations for Englishman
Isaac Newton's theory of universal gravitation. 1648â€“1815. From 1640,
Brandenburg-Prussia had started to rise under the Great Elector, Frederick
William. The Peace of Westphalia in 1648 strengthened it even further, through
the acquisition of East Pomerania. From 1713 to 1740, King Frederick William I,
also known as the "Soldier King", established a highly centralized, militarized
state with a heavily rural population of about three million (compared to the
nine million in Austria). In terms of the boundaries of 1914, Germany in 1700
had a population of 16 million, increasing slightly to 17 million by 1750, and
growing more rapidly to 24 million by 1800. Wars continued, but they were no
longer so devastating to the civilian population; famines and major epidemics
did not occur, but increased agricultural productivity led to a higher birth
rate, and a lower death rate. Wars. Louis XIV of France conquered parts of
Alsace and Lorraine (1678â€“1681), and had invaded and devastated the
Electorate of the Palatinate (1688â€“1697) in the War of Palatinian Succession.
Louis XIV benefited from the Empire's problems with the Turks, which were
menacing Austria. Louis XIV ultimately had to relinquish the Electorate of the
Palatinate. Afterwards Hungary was reconquered from the Turks; Austria, under
the Habsburgs, developed into a great power. In the War of Austrian Succession
(1740â€“1748) Maria Theresa fought successfully for recognition of her
succession to the throne. But in the Silesian Wars and in the Seven Years' War
she had to cede Silesia to Frederick II, the Great, of Prussia. After the Peace
of Hubertsburg in 1763 between Austria, Prussia and Saxony, Prussia became a
European great power. This gave the start to the rivalry between Prussia and
Austria for the leadership of Germany. From 1763, against resistance from the
nobility and citizenry, an "enlightened absolutism" was established in Prussia
and Austria, according to which the ruler governed according to the best
precepts of the philosophers. The economies developed and legal reforms were
undertaken, including the abolition of torture and the improvement in the
status of Jews. Emancipation of the peasants slowly began. Compulsory education
was instituted. In 1772â€“1795 Prussia took part in the partitions of Poland.
Prussia occupied the western territories of the former Polishâ€“Lithuanian
Commonwealth that surrounded existing Prussian holdings. This occupation led to
centuries of Polish resistance against Germanization. Smaller states.
Completely overshadowed by Prussia and Austria, the smaller German states were
generally characterized by political lethargy and administrative inefficiency,
often compounded by rulers who were more concerned with their mistresses and
their hunting dogs than with the affairs of state. Bavaria was especially
unfortunate in this regard; it was a rural land with very heavy debts and few
growth centers. Saxony was in economically good shape, although its government
was seriously mismanaged, and numerous wars had taken their toll. In
WÃ¼rttemberg the duke lavished funds on palaces, mistresses, great celebration,
and hunting expeditions. Many of the city-states of Germany were run by
bishops, who in reality were from powerful noble families and showed scant
interest in religion. None developed a significant reputation for good
government. In Hesse-Kassel, the Landgrave Frederick II, ruled 1760â€“1785 as
an enlightened despot, and raised money by renting soldiers (called "Hessians")
to Great Britain to help fight the American Revolutionary War. He combined
Enlightenment ideas with Christian values, cameralist plans for central control
of the economy, and a militaristic approach toward diplomacy. Hanover did not
have to support a lavish courtâ€”its rulers were also kings of England and
resided in London. George III, elector (ruler) from 1760 to 1820, never once
visited Hanover. The local nobility who ran the country opened the University
of GÃ¶ttingen in 1737; it soon became a world-class intellectual center. Baden
sported perhaps the best government of the smaller states. Karl Friedrich ruled
well for 73 years (1738â€“1811) and was an enthusiast for The Enlightenment; he
abolished serfdom in 1783. The smaller states failed to form coalitions with
each other, and were eventually overwhelmed by Prussia. Between 1807 and 1871,
Prussia swallowed up many of the smaller states, with minimal protest, then
went on to found the German Empire. In the process, Prussia became too
heterogeneous, lost its identity, and by the 1930s had become an administrative
shell of little importance. Nobility. In a heavily agrarian society, land
ownership played a central role. Germany's nobles, especially those in the East
â€“ called Junkers â€“ dominated not only the localities, but also the Prussian
court, and especially the Prussian army. Increasingly after 1815, a centralized
Prussian government based in Berlin took over the powers of the nobles, which
in terms of control over the peasantry had been almost absolute. To help the
nobility avoid indebtedness, Berlin set up a credit institution to provide
capital loans in 1809, and extended the loan network to peasants in 1849. When
the German Empire was established in 1871, the Junker nobility controlled the
army and the Navy, the bureaucracy, and the royal court; they generally set
governmental policies. Peasants and rural life. Peasants continued to center
their lives in the village, where they were members of a corporate body and
help manage the community resources and monitor the community life. In the
East, they were serfs who were bound permanently to parcels of land. In most of
Germany, farming was handled by tenant farmers who paid rents and obligatory
services to the landlord, who was typically a nobleman. Peasant leaders
supervised the fields and ditches and grazing rights, maintained public order
and morals, and supported a village court which handled minor offenses. Inside
the family the patriarch made all the decisions, and tried to arrange
advantageous marriages for his children. Much of the villages' communal life
centered around church services and holy days. In Prussia, the peasants drew
lots to choose conscripts required by the army. The noblemen handled external
relationships and politics for the villages under their control, and were not
typically involved in daily activities or decisions. The emancipation of the
serfs came in 1770â€“1830, beginning with Schleswig in 1780. The peasants were
now ex-serfs and could own their land, buy and sell it, and move about freely.
The nobles approved for now they could buy land owned by the peasants. The
chief reformer was Baron vom Stein (1757â€“1831), who was influenced by The
Enlightenment, especially the free market ideas of Adam Smith. The end of
serfdom raised the personal legal status of the peasantry. A bank was set up so
that landowner could borrow government money to buy land from peasants (the
peasants were not allowed to use it to borrow money to buy land until 1850).
The result was that the large landowners obtained larger estates, and many
peasant became landless tenants, or moved to the cities or to America. The
other German states imitated Prussia after 1815. In sharp contrast to the
violence that characterized land reform in the French Revolution, Germany
handled it peacefully. In Schleswig the peasants, who had been influenced by
the Enlightenment, played an active role; elsewhere they were largely passive.
Indeed, for most peasants, customs and traditions continued largely unchanged,
including the old habits of deference to the nobles whose legal authority
remains quite strong over the villagers. Although the peasants were no longer
tied to the same land like serfs had been, the old paternalistic relationship
in East Prussia lasted into the 20th century. The agrarian reforms in
northwestern Germany in the era 1770â€“1870 were driven by progressive
governments and local elites. They abolished feudal obligations and divided
collectively owned common land into private parcels and thus created a more
efficient market-oriented rural economy. It produced increased productivity and
population growth. It strengthened the traditional social order because wealthy
peasants obtained most of the former common land, while the rural proletariat
was left without land; many left for the cities or America. Meanwhile the
division of the common land served as a buffer preserving social peace between
nobles and peasants. In the east the serfs were emancipated but the Junker
class maintained its large estates and monopolized political power. Around 1800
the Catholic monasteries, which had large land holdings, were nationalized and
sold off by the government. In Bavaria they had controlled 56% of the land.
Enlightenment. Before 1750 the German upper classes looked to France for
intellectual, cultural and architectural leadership; French was the language of
high society. By the mid-18th century the "AufklÃ¤rung" (The Enlightenment) had
transformed German high culture in music, philosophy, science and literature.
Christian Wolff (1679â€“1754) was the pioneer as a writer who expounded the
Enlightenment to German readers; he legitimized German as a philosophic
language. Johann Gottfried von Herder (1744â€“1803) broke new ground in
philosophy and poetry, as a leader of the Sturm und Drang movement of proto-
Romanticism. Weimar Classicism ("Weimarer Klassik") was a cultural and literary
movement based in Weimar that sought to establish a new humanism by
synthesizing Romantic, classical, and Enlightenment ideas. The movement, from
1772 until 1805, involved Herder as well as polymath Johann Wolfgang von Goethe
(1749â€“1832) and Friedrich Schiller (1759â€“1805), a poet and historian.
Herder argued that every folk had its own particular identity, which was
expressed in its language and culture. This legitimized the promotion of German
language and culture and helped shape the development of German nationalism.
Schiller's plays expressed the restless spirit of his generation, depicting the
hero's struggle against social pressures and the force of destiny. German
music, sponsored by the upper classes, came of age under composers Johann
Sebastian Bach (1685â€“1750), Joseph Haydn (1732â€“1809), and Wolfgang Amadeus
Mozart (1756â€“1791). In remote KÃ¶nigsberg philosopher Immanuel Kant
(1724â€“1804) tried to reconcile rationalism and religious belief, individual
freedom, and political authority. Kant's work contained basic tensions that
would continue to shape German thought â€“ and indeed all of European
philosophy â€“ well into the 20th century. The German Enlightenment won the
support of princes, aristocrats, and the middle classes, and it permanently
reshaped the culture. French Revolution 1789â€“1815. German reaction to the
French Revolution was mixed at first. German intellectuals celebrated the
outbreak, hoping to see the triumph of Reason and The Enlightenment. The royal
courts in Vienna and Berlin denounced the overthrow of the king and the
threatened spread of notions of liberty, equality, and fraternity. By 1793, the
execution of the French king and the onset of the Terror disillusioned the
BildungsbÃ¼rgertum (educated middle classes). Reformers said the solution was
to have faith in the ability of Germans to reform their laws and institutions
in peaceful fashion. Europe was racked by two decades of war revolving around
France's efforts to spread its revolutionary ideals, and the opposition of
reactionary royalty. War broke out in 1792 as Austria and Prussia invaded
France, but were defeated at the Battle of Valmy (1792). The German lands saw
armies marching back and forth, bringing devastation (albeit on a far lower
scale than the Thirty Years' War, almost two centuries before), but also
bringing new ideas of liberty and civil rights for the people. Prussia and
Austria ended their failed wars with France but (with Russia) partitioned
Poland among themselves in 1793 and 1795. The French took control of the
Rhineland, imposed French-style reforms, abolished feudalism, established
constitutions, promoted freedom of religion, emancipated Jews, opened the
bureaucracy to ordinary citizens of talent, and forced the nobility to share
power with the rising middle class. Napoleon created the Kingdom of Westphalia
(1807â€“1813) as a model state. These reforms proved largely permanent and
modernized the western parts of Germany. When the French tried to impose the
French language, German opposition grew in intensity. A Second Coalition of
Britain, Russia, and Austria then attacked France but failed. Napoleon
established direct or indirect control over most of western Europe, including
the German states apart from Prussia and Austria. The old Holy Roman Empire was
little more than a farce; Napoleon simply abolished it in 1806 while forming
new countries under his control. In Germany Napoleon set up the "Confederation
of the Rhine," comprising most of the German states except Prussia and Austria.
Prussia tried to remain neutral while imposing tight controls on dissent, but
with German nationalism sharply on the rise, the small nation blundered by
going to war with Napoleon in 1806. Its economy was weak, its leadership poor,
and the once mighty Prussian army was a hollow shell. Napoleon easily crushed
it at the Battle of Jena (1806). Napoleon occupied Berlin, and Prussia paid
dearly. Prussia lost its recently acquired territories in western Germany, its
army was reduced to 42,000 men, no trade with Britain was allowed, and Berlin
had to pay Paris heavy reparations and fund the French army of occupation.
Saxony changed sides to support Napoleon and join his Confederation of the
Rhine; its elector was rewarded with the title of king and given a slice of
Poland taken from Prussia. After Napoleon's fiasco in Russia in 1812, including
the deaths of many Germans in his invasion army, Prussia joined with Russia.
Major battles followed in quick order, and when Austria switched sides to
oppose Napoleon his situation grew tenuous. He was defeated in a great Battle
of Leipzig in late 1813, and Napoleon's empire started to collapse. One after
another the German states switched to oppose Napoleon, but he rejected peace
terms. Allied armies invaded France in early 1814, Paris fell, and in April
Napoleon surrendered. He returned for 100 days in 1815, but was finally
defeated by the British and German armies at Waterloo. Prussia was the big
winner at the Vienna peace conference, gaining extensive territory. German
Confederation. The German Confederation () was the loose association of 39
states created in 1815 to coordinate the economies of separate German-speaking
countries. It acted as a buffer between the powerful states of Austria and
Prussia. Britain approved of it because London felt that there was need for a
stable, peaceful power in central Europe that could discourage aggressive moves
by France or Russia. According to Lee (1985), most historians have judged the
Confederation to be weak and ineffective, as well as an obstacle to German
nationalist aspirations. It collapsed because the rivalry between Prussia and
Austria (known as German dualism), warfare, the 1848 revolution, and the
inability of the multiple members to compromise. It was replaced by the North
German Confederation in 1866. Society and economy. Population. The population
of the German Confederation (excluding Austria) grew 60% from 1815 to 1865,
from 21,000,000 to 34,000,000. The era saw the Demographic Transition take
place in Germany. It was a transition from high birth rates and high death
rates to low birth and death rates as the country developed from a pre-
industrial to a modernized agriculture and supported a fast-growing
industrialized urban economic system. In previous centuries, the shortage of
land meant that not everyone could marry, and marriages took place after age
25. After 1815, increased agricultural productivity meant a larger food supply,
and a decline in famines, epidemics, and malnutrition. This allowed couples to
marry earlier, and have more children. Arranged marriages became uncommon as
young people were now allowed to choose their own marriage partners, subject to
a veto by the parents. The high birthrate was offset by a very high rate of
infant mortality and emigration, especially after about 1840, mostly to the
German settlements in the United States, plus periodic epidemics and harvest
failures. The upper and middle classes began to practice birth control, and a
little later so too did the peasants. Industrialization. Before 1850 Germany
lagged far behind the leaders in industrial development â€“ Britain, France,
and Belgium. In 1800, Germany's social structure was poorly suited to
entrepreneurship or economic development. Domination by France during the era
of the French Revolution (1790s to 1815), however, produced important
institutional reforms. Reforms included the abolition of feudal restrictions on
the sale of large landed estates, the reduction of the power of the guilds in
the cities, and the introduction of a new, more efficient commercial law.
Nevertheless, traditionalism remained strong in most of Germany. Until
midcentury, the guilds, the landed aristocracy, the churches, and the
government bureaucracies had so many rules and restrictions that
entrepreneurship was held in low esteem, and given little opportunity to
develop. From the 1830s and 1840s, Prussia, Saxony, and other states
reorganized agriculture. The introduction of sugar beets, turnips, and potatoes
yielded a higher level of food production, which enabled a surplus rural
population to move to industrial areas. The beginnings of the industrial
revolution in Germany came in the textile industry, and was facilitated by
eliminating tariff barriers through the Zollverein, starting in 1834. By
midcentury, the German states were catching up. By 1900 Germany was a world
leader in industrialization, along with Britain and the United States.
Urbanization. Industrialization brought rural Germans to the factories, mines
and railways. The population in 1800 was heavily rural, with only 10% of the
people living in communities of 5000 or more people, and only 2% living in
cities of more than 100,000. After 1815, the urban population grew rapidly, due
primarily to the influx of young people from the rural areas. Berlin grew from
172,000 in 1800, to 826,000 in 1870; Hamburg grew from 130,000 to 290,000;
Munich from 40,000 to 269,000; and Dresden from 60,000 to 177,000. Offsetting
this growth, there was extensive emigration, especially to the United States.
Emigration totaled 480,000 in the 1840s, 1,200,000 in the 1850s, and 780,000 in
the 1860s. Railways. Lacking a technological base at first, the Germans
imported their engineering and hardware from Britain, but quickly learned the
skills needed to operate and expand the railways. In many cities, the new
railway shops were the centres of technological awareness and training, so that
by 1850, Germany was self-sufficient in meeting the demands of railroad
construction, and the railways were a major impetus for the growth of the new
steel industry. Observers found that even as late as 1890, their engineering
was inferior to Britainâ€™s. However, German unification in 1870 stimulated
consolidation, nationalisation into state-owned companies, and further rapid
growth. Unlike the situation in France, the goal was support of
industrialisation, and so heavy lines crisscrossed the Ruhr and other
industrial districts, and provided good connections to the major ports of
Hamburg and Bremen. By 1880, Germany had 9,400 locomotives pulling 43,000
passengers and 30,000 tons of freight a day, and forged ahead of France.
Science and culture. German artists and intellectuals, heavily influenced by
the French Revolution and by the great German poet and writer Johann Wolfgang
von Goethe (1749â€“1832), turned to Romanticism after a period of
Enlightenment. Philosophical thought was decisively shaped by Immanuel Kant
(1724â€“1804). Ludwig van Beethoven (1770â€“1827) was the leading composer of
Romantic music. His use of tonal architecture in such a way as to allow
significant expansion of musical forms and structures was immediately
recognized as bringing a new dimension to music. His later piano music and
string quartets, especially, showed the way to a completely unexplored musical
universe, and influenced Franz Schubert (1797â€“1828) and Robert Schumann
(1810â€“1856). In opera, a new Romantic atmosphere combining supernatural
terror and melodramatic plot in a folkloric context was first successfully
achieved by Carl Maria von Weber (1786â€“1826) and perfected by Richard Wagner
(1813â€“1883) in his Ring Cycle. The Brothers Grimm (1785â€“1863 & 1786â€“1859)
not only wrote the popular Grimm's Fairy Tales, but were among the founding
fathers of German philology and German studies. At the universities high-
powered professors developed international reputations, especially in the
humanities led by history and philology, which brought a new historical
perspective to the study of political history, theology, philosophy, language,
and literature. With Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770â€“1831) in philosophy,
Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768â€“1834) in theology and Leopold von Ranke
(1795â€“1886) in history, the University of Berlin, founded in 1810, became the
world's leading university. Von Ranke, for example, professionalized history
and set the world standard for historiography. By the 1830s mathematics,
physics, chemistry, and biology had emerged with world class science, led by
Alexander von Humboldt (1769â€“1859) in natural science and Carl Friedrich
Gauss (1777â€“1855) in mathematics. Young intellectuals often turned to
politics, but their support for the failed Revolution of 1848 forced many into
exile. Politics of restoration and revolution. German Confederation and the
early 1800s. After the fall of Napoleon, Europe's statesmen convened in Vienna
in 1815 for the reorganisation of European affairs, under the leadership of the
Austrian Prince Metternich. The political principles agreed upon at this
Congress of Vienna included the restoration, legitimacy and solidarity of
rulers for the repression of revolutionary and nationalist ideas. The German
Confederation () was founded, a loose union of 39 states (35 ruling princes and
4 free cities) under Austrian leadership, with a Federal Diet () meeting in
Frankfurt am Main. It was a loose coalition that failed to satisfy most
nationalists. The member states largely went their own way, and Austria had its
own interests. In 1819 a student radical assassinated the reactionary
playwright August von Kotzebue, who had scoffed at liberal student
organisations. In one of the few major actions of the German Confederation,
Prince Metternich called a conference that issued the repressive Carlsbad
Decrees, designed to suppress liberal agitation against the conservative
governments of the German states. The Decrees terminated the fast-fading
nationalist fraternities (), removed liberal university professors, and
expanded the censorship of the press. The decrees began the "persecution of the
demagogues", which was directed against individuals who were accused of
spreading revolutionary and nationalist ideas. Among the persecuted were the
poet Ernst Moritz Arndt, the publisher Johann Joseph GÃ¶rres and the "Father of
Gymnastics" Ludwig Jahn. In 1834 the Zollverein was established, a customs
union between Prussia and most other German states, but excluding Austria. As
industrialisation developed, the need for a unified German state with a uniform
currency, legal system, and government became more and more obvious. 1848.
Growing discontent with the political and social order imposed by the Congress
of Vienna led to the outbreak, in 1848, of the March Revolution in the German
states. In May the German National Assembly (the Frankfurt Parliament) met in
Frankfurt to draw up a national German constitution. But the 1848 revolution
turned out to be unsuccessful: King Frederick William IV of Prussia refused the
imperial crown, the Frankfurt parliament was dissolved, the ruling princes
repressed the risings by military force, and the German Confederation was re-
established by 1850. Many leaders went into exile, including a number who went
to the United States and became a political force there. 1850s. The 1850s were
a period of extreme political reaction. Dissent was vigorously suppressed, and
many Germans emigrated to America following the collapse of the 1848 uprisings.
Frederick William IV became extremely depressed and melancholy during this
period, and was surrounded by men who advocated clericalism and absolute divine
monarchy. The Prussian people once again lost interest in politics. Prussia not
only expanded its territory but began to industrialize rapidly, while
maintaining a strong agricultural base. Bismarck takes charge, 1862â€“66. In
1857, the king had a stroke and his brother William became regent, then became
King William I in 1861. Although conservative, William I was far more
pragmatic. His most significant accomplishment was naming Otto von Bismarck as
chancellor in 1862. The combination of Bismarck, Defense Minister Albrecht von
Roon, and Field Marshal Helmut von Moltke set the stage for victories over
Denmark, Austria, and France, and led to the unification of Germany. The
obstacle to German unification was Austria, and Bismarck solved the problem
with a series of wars that united the German states north of Austria. In
1863â€“64, disputes between Prussia and Denmark grew over Schleswig, which was
not part of the German Confederation, and which Danish nationalists wanted to
incorporate into the Danish kingdom. The dispute led to the short Second War of
Schleswig in 1864. Prussia, joined by Austria, easily defeated Denmark and
occupied Jutland. The Danes were forced to cede both the duchy of Schleswig and
the duchy of Holstein to Austria and Prussia. In the aftermath, the management
of the two duchies caused escalating tensions between Austria and Prussia. The
former wanted the duchies to become an independent entity within the German
Confederation, while the latter wanted to annex them. The Seven Weeks War
between Austria and Germany broke out in June 1866. In July, the two armies
clashed at Sadowa-Koniggratz (Bohemia) in an enormous battle involving half a
million men. The Prussian breech-loading needle guns carried the day over the
slow muzzle-loading rifles of the Austrians, who lost a quarter of their army
in the battle. Austria ceded Venice to Italy, but Bismarck was deliberately
lenient with the loser to keep alive a long-term alliance with Austria in a
subordinate role. Now the French faced an increasingly strong Prussia. North
German Federation. In 1866, the German Confederation was dissolved. In its
place the North German Federation (German "Norddeutscher Bund") was
established, under the leadership of Prussia. Austria was excluded, and the
Austrian influence in Germany that had begun in the 15th century finally came
to an end. The North German Federation was a transitional organisation that
existed from 1867 to 1871, between the dissolution of the German Confederation
and the founding of the German Empire. German Empire. Overview. After Germany
was united by Otto von Bismarck into the "Second German Reich", he determined
German politics until 1890. Bismarck tried to foster alliances in Europe, on
one hand to contain France, and on the other hand to consolidate Germany's
influence in Europe. On the domestic front Bismarck tried to stem the rise of
socialism by anti-socialist laws, combined with an introduction of health care
and social security. At the same time Bismarck tried to reduce the political
influence of the emancipated Catholic minority in the Kulturkampf, literally
"culture struggle". The Catholics only grew stronger, forming the Center
(Zentrum) Party. Germany grew rapidly in industrial and economic power,
matching Britain by 1900. Its highly professional army was the best in the
world, but the navy could never catch up with Britain's Royal Navy. In 1888,
the young and ambitious Kaiser Wilhelm II became emperor. He could not abide
advice, least of all from the most experienced politician and diplomat in
Europe, so he fired Bismarck. The Kaiser opposed Bismarck's careful foreign
policy and wanted Germany to pursue colonialist policies, as Britain and France
had been doing for decades, as well as build a navy that could match the
British. The Kaiser promoted active colonization of Africa and Asia for those
areas that were not already colonies of other European powers; his record was
notoriously brutal and set the stage for genocide. The Kaiser took a mostly
unilateral approach in Europe with as main ally the Austro-Hungarian Empire,
and an arms race with Britain, which eventually led to the situation in which
the assassination of the Austrian-Hungarian crown prince could spark off World
War I. Age of Bismarck. The new empire. Disputes between France and Prussia
increased. In 1868, the Spanish queen Isabella II was expelled by a revolution,
leaving that country's throne vacant. When Prussia tried to put a Hohenzollern
candidate, Prince Leopold, on the Spanish throne, the French angrily protested.
In July 1870, France declared war on Prussia (the Franco-Prussian War). The
debacle was swift. A succession of German victories in northeastern France
followed, and one French army was besieged at Metz. After a few weeks, the main
army was finally forced to capitulate in the fortress of Sedan. French Emperor
Napoleon III was taken prisoner and a republic hastily proclaimed in Paris. The
new government, realising that a victorious Germany would demand territorial
acquisitions, resolved to fight on. They began to muster new armies, and the
Germans settled down to a grim siege of Paris. The starving city surrendered in
January 1871, and the Prussian army staged a victory parade in it. France was
forced to pay indemnities of 5Â billion francs and cede Alsace-Lorraine. It was
a bitter peace that would leave the French thirsting for revenge. During the
Siege of Paris, the German princes assembled in the Hall of Mirrors of the
Palace of Versailles and proclaimed the Prussian King Wilhelm I as the "German
Emperor" on 18 January 1871. The German Empire was thus founded, with the
German states unified into a single economic, political, and administrative
unit. The empire comprised 25 states, three of which were Hanseatic free
cities. It was dubbed the "Little German" solution, since it excluded the
Austrian territories and the Habsburgs. Bismarck, again, was appointed to serve
as Chancellor. The new empire was characterised by a great enthusiasm and
vigor. There was a rash of heroic artwork in imitation of Greek and Roman
styles, and the nation possessed a vigorous, growing industrial economy, while
it had always been rather poor in the past. The change from the slower, more
tranquil order of the old Germany was very sudden, and many, especially the
nobility, resented being displaced by the new rich. And yet, the nobles clung
stubbornly to power, and they, not the bourgeois, continued to be the model
that everyone wanted to imitate. In imperial Germany, possessing a collection
of medals or wearing a uniform was valued more than the size of one's bank
account, and Berlin never became a great cultural center as London, Paris, or
Vienna were. The empire was distinctly authoritarian in tone, as the 1871
constitution gave the emperor exclusive power to appoint or dismiss the
chancellor. He also was supreme commander-in-chief of the armed forces and
final arbiter of foreign policy. But freedom of speech, association, and
religion were nonetheless guaranteed by the constitution. Bismarck's domestic
policies as Chancellor of Germany were characterised by his fight against
perceived enemies of the Protestant Prussian state. In the so-called
Kulturkampf (1872â€“1878), he tried to limit the influence of the Roman
Catholic Church and of its political arm, the Catholic Centre Party, through
various measuresâ€”like the introduction of civil marriageâ€”but without much
success. The Kulturkampf antagonised many Protestants as well as Catholics, and
was eventually abandoned. Millions of non-Germans subjects in the German
Empire, like the Polish, Danish and French minorities, were discriminated
against, and a policy of Germanisation was implemented. Classes. Germany's
middle class, based in the cities, grew exponentially, although it never gained
the political power it had in France, Britain or the United States. The
Association of German Women's Organizations (BDF) was established in 1894 to
encompass the proliferating women's organizations that had sprung up since the
1860s. From the beginning the BDF was a bourgeois organization, its members
working toward equality with men in such areas as education, financial
opportunities, and political life. Working-class women were not welcome; they
were organized by the Socialists. The rise of the Socialist Workers' Party
(later known as the Social Democratic Party of Germany, SPD), declared its aim
to establish peacefully a new socialist order through the transformation of
existing political and social conditions. From 1878, Bismarck tried to repress
the social democratic movement by outlawing the party's organisation, its
assemblies and most of its newspapers. When it finally was allowed to run
candidates, the Social Democrats were stronger than ever. Bismarck built on a
tradition of welfare programs in Prussia and Saxony that began as early as the
1840s. In the 1880s he introduced old age pensions, accident insurance, medical
care, and unemployment insurance that formed the basis of the modern European
welfare state. His paternalistic programs won the support of German industry
because its goals were to win the support of the working classes for the Empire
and reduce the outflow of immigrants to America, where wages were higher but
welfare did not exist. Bismarck further won the support of both industry and
skilled workers by his high tariff policies, which protected profits and wages
from American competition, although they alienated the liberal intellectuals
who wanted free trade. Kulturkampf. In 1871â€“1878, Bismarck launched the
"Kulturkampf" in Prussia to reduce the power of the Catholic Church in public
affairs, and keep the Poles under control. Thousands of priests and bishops
were harassed or imprisoned, with large fines and closures of Catholic churches
and schools. While the pope did control the selection of bishops, the Catholics
supported unification and most of Bismarck's policies, and were angry at his
systematic attacks. Bismarck sought to appeal to liberals and Protestants but
he failed because the Catholics were unanimous in their resistance and
organized themselves to fight back politically, using their strength in other
states besides Prussia. (The Kulturkampf did not extend to the other German
states such as heavily Catholic Bavaria.) German nationalists feared the
Polonization of the Prussian East. Bismarck saw the Kulturkampf as a means of
stopping this trend, which was led by the Catholic clergy in West Prussia,
Poznania and Silesia. The Poles were Catholics and subjected to harassment in
the fields of education, occupations, business and public administration.
German was declared to be the only official language, but in practice the Poles
only adhered more closely to their traditions. There was little or no violence,
but the new Catholic Center Party won a fourth of the seats in the Reichstag
(Imperial Parliament), and its middle position on most issues allowed it to
play a decisive role in the formation of majorities. The culture war gave
secularists and socialists an opportunity to attack all religions, an outcome
that distressed the Protestants, including Bismarck, who was a devout pietistic
Protestant. The Catholic anti-liberalism was led by Pope Pius IX; his death in
1878 allowed Bismarck to open negotiations with Pope Leo XIII, and led to the
abandonment of the Kulturkampf in stages in the early 1880s. Foreign policy.
Bismarck's post-1871 foreign policy was conservative and basically aimed at
security and preventing the dreaded scenario of a Franco-Russian alliance,
which would trap Germany between the two in a war. The League of Three Emperors
("Dreikaisersbund") was signed in 1872 by Russia, Austria, and Germany. It
stated that republicanism and socialism were common enemies and that the three
powers would discuss any matters concerning foreign policy. Bismarck needed
good relations with Russia in order to keep France isolated. In 1877â€“1878,
Russia fought a victorious war with the Ottoman Empire and attempted to impose
the Treaty of San Stefano on it. This upset the British in particular, as they
were long concerned with preserving the Ottoman Empire and preventing a Russian
takeover of the Bosphorus Strait. Germany hosted the Congress of Berlin (1878),
whereby a more moderate peace settlement was agreed to. Germany had no direct
interest in the Balkans, however, which was largely an Austrian and Russian
sphere of influence, although King Carol of Romania was a German prince. In
1879, Bismarck formed a Dual Alliance of Germany and Austria-Hungary, with the
aim of mutual military assistance in the case of an attack from Russia, which
was not satisfied with the agreement reached at the Congress of Berlin. The
establishment of the Dual Alliance led Russia to take a more conciliatory
stance, and in 1887, the so-called Reinsurance Treaty was signed between
Germany and Russia: in it, the two powers agreed on mutual military support in
the case that France attacked Germany, or in case of an Austrian attack on
Russia. Russia turned its attention eastward to Asia and remained largely
inactive in European politics for the next 25 years. In 1882, Italy joined the
Dual Alliance to form a Triple Alliance. Italy wanted to defend its interests
in North Africa against France's colonial policy. In return for German and
Austrian support, Italy committed itself to assisting Germany in the case of a
French military attack. For a long time, Bismarck had refused to give in
widespread public demands to give Germany "a place in the sun" through the
acquisition of overseas colonies. In 1880 Bismarck gave way, and a number of
colonies were established overseas. In Africa, these were Togo, the Cameroons,
German South-West Africa, and German East Africa; in Oceania, they were German
New Guinea, the Bismarck Archipelago, and the Marshall Islands. In fact, it was
Bismarck himself who helped initiate the Berlin Conference of 1885. He did it
to "establish international guidelines for the acquisition of African
territory" (see Colonisation of Africa). This conference was an impetus for the
"Scramble for Africa" and "New Imperialism". After annexing the Sudetenland
border country of Czechoslovakia (October 1938), and taking over the rest of
the Czech lands as a protectorate (March 1939), the German Reich and the Soviet
Union invaded Poland on first September 1939 predominantly as part of the
Wehrmacht operation codenamed "Fall Weiss". The invasion of Poland began World
War II. Bismarck dismissed by new Kaiser. In 1888, the old emperor William I
died at the age of 90. His son Frederick III, the hope of German liberals,
succeeded him, but was already stricken with throat cancer and died three
months later. Frederick's son Wilhelm II then became emperor at the age of 29.
He was the antithesis of old, conservative Germans like Bismarck, addicted to
the new imperialism that was taking place in Asia and Africa. Having a left arm
withered by childhood polio, he was painfully insecure and desired above all to
be loved by the people. He sought to make Germany a great world power with a
navy to rival Britain's. Bismarck hoped to marginalise him just as he had
marginalised his grandfather, but William II desired to be his own master.
Bismarck's schemes to dominate the emperor and hold onto his own power failed,
and he was forced to resign in March 1890. Wilhelminian Era. Alliances and
diplomacy. The young Kaiser Wilhelm sought aggressively to increasing Germany's
influence in the world ("Weltpolitik"). After the removal of Bismarck, foreign
policy was in the hands of the erratic Kaiser, who played an increasingly
reckless hand, and the powerful foreign office under the leadership of
Friedrich von Holstein. The foreign office argued that: first, a long-term
coalition between France and Russia had to fall apart; secondly, Russia and
Britain would never get together; and, finally, Britain would eventually seek
an alliance with Germany. Germany refused to renew its treaties with Russia.
But Russia did form a closer relationship with France in the Dual Alliance of
1894, since both were worried about the possibilities of German aggression.
Furthermore, Angloâ€“German relations cooled as Germany aggressively tried to
build a new empire and engaged in a naval race with Britain; London refused to
agree to the formal alliance that Germany sought. Berlin's analysis proved
mistaken on every point, leading to Germany's increasing isolation and its
dependence on the Triple Alliance, which brought together Germany, Austria-
Hungary, and Italy. The Triple Alliance was undermined by differences between
Austria and Italy, and in 1915 Italy switched sides. Meanwhile the German Navy
under Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz had ambitions to rival the great British Navy,
and dramatically expanded its fleet in the early 20th century to protect the
colonies and exert power worldwide. Tirpitz started a programme of warship
construction in 1898. In 1890, Germany had gained the island of Heligoland in
the North Sea from Britain in exchange for the eastern African island of
Zanzibar, and proceeded to construct a great naval base there. This posed a
direct threat to British hegemony on the seas, with the result that
negotiations for an alliance between Germany and Britain broke down. The
British, however, kept well ahead in the naval race by the introduction of the
highly advanced new "Dreadnought" battleship in 1907. In the First Moroccan
Crisis of 1905, Germany nearly came to blows with Britain and France when the
latter attempted to establish a protectorate over Morocco. The Germans were
upset at having not been informed about French intentions, and declared their
support for Moroccan independence. William II made a highly provocative speech
regarding this. The following year, a conference was held in which all of the
European powers except Austria-Hungary (by now little more than a German
satellite) sided with France. A compromise was brokered by the United States
where the French relinquished some, but not all, control over Morocco. The
Second Moroccan Crisis of 1911 saw another dispute over Morocco erupt when
France tried to suppress a revolt there. Germany, still smarting from the
previous quarrel, agreed to a settlement whereby the French ceded some
territory in central Africa in exchange for Germany's renouncing any right to
intervene in Moroccan affairs. This confirmed French control over Morocco,
which became a full protectorate of that country in 1912. Economy. The economy
continued to industrialize and urbanize, with heavy industry â€“ especially
coal and steel â€“ becoming important in the Ruhr, and manufacturing growing in
the cities, the Ruhr, and Silesia. Perkins (1981) argues that more important
than Bismarck's new tariff on imported grain was the introduction of the sugar
beet as a main crop. Farmers quickly abandoned traditional, inefficient
practices in favor of modern methods, including use of new fertilizers and new
tools. The knowledge and tools gained from the intensive farming of sugar and
other root crops made Germany the most efficient agricultural producer in
Europe by 1914. Even so, farms were small in size, and women did much of the
field work. An unintended consequence was the increased dependence on
migratory, especially foreign, labor. Based on its leadership in chemical
research in the universities and industrial laboratories, Germany became
dominant in the world's chemical industry in the late 19th century. At first,
the production of dyes was critical. Germany became Europe's leading steel-
producing nation in the 1890s, thanks in large part to the protection from
American and British competition afforded by tariffs and cartels. The leading
firm was "Friedrich Krupp AG Hoesch-Krupp," run by the Krupp family. The merger
of several major firms into the "Vereinigte Stahlwerke" (United Steel Works) in
1926 was modeled on the U.S. Steel corporation in the United States. The new
company emphasized rationalization of management structures and modernization
of the technology; it employed a multi-divisional structure and used return-on-
investment as its measure of success. By 1913, American and German exports
dominated the world steel market, as Britain slipped to third place. In
machinery, iron and steel, and other industries, German firms avoided cut-
throat competition and instead relied on trade associations. Germany was a
world leader because of its prevailing "corporatist mentality", its strong
bureaucratic tradition, and the encouragement of the government. These
associations regulate competition and allowed small firms to function in the
shadow of much larger companies. Colonies. In the course of ongoing
imperialistic aspirations in all European great powers, a general tendency
towards colonial imperialism also existed in the German states since ca. 1848.
As part of the "Weltpolitik" ("global policy"), the German Empire demanded its
"Platz an der Sonne" ("Place in the sun"). Bismarck began the process, and by
1884 had acquired German New Guinea. By the 1890s, German colonial expansion in
Asia and the Pacific (Kiauchau in China, the Marianas, the Caroline Islands,
Samoa) led to frictions with Britain, Russia, Japan and the United States. The
construction of the Baghdad Railway, financed by German banks, was designed to
eventually connect Germany with the Turkish Empire and the Persian Gulf, but it
also collided with British and Russian geopolitical interests. The largest
colonial enterprises were in Africa, where the harsh treatment of the Nama and
Herero in what is now Namibia in 1906â€“07 led to charges of genocide against
the Germans. World War I. Causes. Ethnic demands for nation states upset the
balance between the empires that dominated Europe, leading to World War I,
which started in August 1914. Germany stood behind its ally Austria in a
confrontation with Serbia, but Serbia was under the protection of Russia, which
was allied to France. Germany was the leader of the Central Powers, which
included Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and later Bulgaria; arrayed
against them were the Allies, comprised chiefly of Russia, France, Britain, and
in 1915 Italy. In explaining why neutral Britain went to war with Germany,
Kennedy (1980) recognized it was critical for war that Germany become
economically more powerful than Britain, but he downplays the disputes over
economic trade imperialism, the Baghdad Railway, confrontations in Central and
Eastern Europe, high-charged political rhetoric and domestic pressure-groups.
Germany's reliance time and again on sheer power, while Britain increasingly
appealed to moral sensibilities, played a role, especially in seeing the
invasion of Belgium as a necessary military tactic or a profound moral crime.
The German invasion of Belgium was not important because the British decision
had already been made and the British were more concerned with the fate of
France (pp.Â 457â€“62). Kennedy argues that by far the main reason was London's
fear that a repeat of 1870 â€” when Prussia and the German states smashed
France â€” would mean that Germany, with a powerful army and navy, would
control the English Channel and northwest France. British policy makers
insisted that would be a catastrophe for British security. Western Front. In
the west, Germany sought a quick victory by encircling Paris using the
Schlieffen Plan. But it failed due to Belgian resistance, Berlin's diversion of
troops, and very stiff French resistance on the Marne, north of Paris. The
Western Front became an extremely bloody battleground of trench warfare. The
stalemate lasted from 1914 until early 1918, with ferocious battles that moved
forces a few hundred yards at best along a line that stretched from the North
Sea to the Swiss border. The British imposed a tight naval blockade in the
North Sea which lasted until 1919, sharply reducing Germany's overseas access
to raw materials and foodstuffs. Food scarcity became a serious problem by
1917. The United States joined with the Allies in April 1917. The entry of the
United States into the war â€“ following Germany's declaration of unrestricted
submarine warfare â€“ marked a decisive turning-point against Germany. Eastern
Front. More wide open was the fighting on the Eastern Front. In the east, there
were decisive victories against the Russian army, the trapping and defeat of
large parts of the Russian contingent at the Battle of Tannenberg, followed by
huge Austrian and German successes. The breakdown of Russian forces â€“
exacerbated by internal turmoil caused by the 1917 Russian Revolution â€“ led
to an imposed peace and the favorable Treaty of Brest-Litovsk on 3 March 1918
as Russia withdrew from the war. 1918. By defeating Russia in 1917 Germany was
able to bring hundreds of thousands of combat troops from the east to the
Western Front, giving it a numerical advantage over the Allies. By retraining
the soldiers in new storm-trooper tactics, the Germans expected to unfreeze the
Battlefield and win a decisive victory before the American army arrived in
strength. However, the spring offensives all failed, as the Allies fell back
and regrouped, and the Germans lacked the reserves necessary to consolidate
their gains. In the summer, with the Americans arriving at 10,000 a day, and
the German reserves exhausted, it was only a matter of time before multiple
Allied offenses destroyed the German army. Meanwhile, conditions deteriorated
rapidly on the home front, with severe food shortages reported in all urban
areas. Causes involved the transfer of many farmers and food workers into the
military, an overburdened railroad system, shortages of coal, and the British
blockade that cut off imports from abroad. The winter of 1916â€“1917 was known
as the "turnip winter," because that vegetable, usually fed to livestock, was
used by people as a substitute for potatoes and meat, which were increasingly
scarce. Thousands of soup kitchens were opened to feed the hungry people, who
grumbled that the farmers were keeping the food for themselves. Even the army
had to cut the rations for soldiers. Morale of both civilians and soldiers
continued to sink. The end of October 1918, in Kiel, in northern Germany, saw
the beginning of the German Revolution of 1918â€“19. Units of the German Navy
refused to set sail for a last, large-scale operation in a war which they saw
as good as lost, initiating the uprising. On 3 November, the revolt spread to
other cities and states of the country, in many of which workers' and soldiers'
councils were established. Meanwhile, Hindenburg and the senior commanders had
lost confidence in the Kaiser and his government. The Kaiser and all German
ruling princes abdicated. On 9 November 1918, the Social Democrat Philipp
Scheidemann proclaimed a Republic. On 11 November, the CompiÃ¨gne armistice was
signed, ending the war. The Treaty of Versailles was signed on 28 June 1919.
Germany was to cede Alsace-Lorraine, Eupen-MalmÃ©dy, North Schleswig, and the
Memel area. All German colonies were to be handed over to the British and
French. Poland was restored and most of the provinces of Posen and West
Prussia, and some areas of Upper Silesia were reincorporated into the reformed
country after plebiscites and independence uprisings. The left and right banks
of the Rhine were to be permanently demilitarised. The industrially important
Saarland was to be governed by the League of Nations for 15 years and its
coalfields administered by France. At the end of that time a plebiscite was to
determine the Saar's future status. To ensure execution of the treaty's terms,
Allied troops would occupy the left (German) bank of the Rhine for a period of
5â€“15 years. The German army was to be limited to 100,000 officers and men;
the general staff was to be dissolved; vast quantities of war material were to
be handed over and the manufacture of munitions rigidly curtailed. The navy was
to be similarly reduced, and no military aircraft were allowed. Germany and its
allies were to accept the sole responsibility of the war, in accordance with
the War Guilt Clause, and were to pay financial reparations for all loss and
damage suffered by the Allies. 1918 was also the year of the deadly 1918
Spanish Flu pandemic which struck hard at a population weakened by years of
malnutrition. Weimar Republic. Overview. The humiliating peace terms in the
Treaty of Versailles provoked bitter indignation throughout Germany, and
seriously weakened the new democratic regime. The greatest enemies of democracy
had already been constituted. In December 1918, the Communist Party of Germany
(KPD) was founded, and in 1919 it tried and failed to overthrow the new
republic. Adolf Hitler in 1919 took control of the new National Socialist
German Workers' Party (NSDAP), which failed in a coup in Munich in 1923. Both
parties, as well as parties supporting the republic, built militant auxiliaries
that engaged in increasingly violent street battles. Electoral support for both
parties increased after 1929 as the Great Depression hit the economy hard,
producing many unemployed men who became available for the paramilitary units.
The Nazis, with a mostly rural and lower middle class base, overthrew the
Weimar regime and ruled Germany in 1933â€“1945; the KPD, with a mostly urban
and working class base, came to power (in the East) in 1945â€“1989. The early
years. On 11 August 1919 the Weimar constitution came into effect, with
Friedrich Ebert as first President. On 30 December 1918, the Communist Party of
Germany was founded by the Spartacus League, who had split from the Social
Democratic Party during the war. It was headed by Rosa Luxemburg and Karl
Liebknecht, and rejected the parliamentary system. In 1920, about 300,000
members from the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany joined the
party, transforming it into a mass organization. The Communist Party had a
following of about 10% of the electorate. In the first months of 1920, the
Reichswehr was to be reduced to 100,000 men, in accordance with the Treaty of
Versailles. This included the dissolution of many Freikorps â€“ units made up
of volunteers. In an attempt at a coup d'Ã©tat in March 1920, the Kapp Putsch,
extreme right-wing politician Wolfgang Kapp let Freikorps soldiers march on
Berlin and proclaimed himself Chancellor of the Reich. After four days the coup
d'Ã©tat collapsed, due to popular opposition and lack of support by the civil
servants and the officers. Other cities were shaken by strikes and rebellions,
which were bloodily suppressed. Faced with animosity from Britain and France
and the retreat of American power from Europe, in 1922 Germany was the first
state to establish diplomatic relations with the new Soviet Union. Under the
Treaty of Rapallo, Germany accorded the Soviet Union "de jure" recognition, and
the two signatories mutually cancelled all pre-war debts and renounced war
claims. When Germany defaulted on its reparation payments, French and Belgian
troops occupied the heavily industrialised Ruhr district (January 1923). The
German government encouraged the population of the Ruhr to passive resistance:
shops would not sell goods to the foreign soldiers, coal-mines would not dig
for the foreign troops, trams in which members of the occupation army had taken
seat would be left abandoned in the middle of the street. The passive
resistance proved effective, insofar as the occupation became a loss-making
deal for the French government. But the Ruhr fight also led to hyperinflation,
and many who lost all their fortune would become bitter enemies of the Weimar
Republic, and voters of the anti-democratic right. See 1920s German inflation.
In September 1923, the deteriorating economic conditions led Chancellor Gustav
Stresemann to call an end to the passive resistance in the Ruhr. In November,
his government introduced a new currency, the Rentenmark (later: Reichsmark),
together with other measures to stop the hyperinflation. In the following six
years the economic situation improved. In 1928, Germany's industrial production
even regained the pre-war levels of 1913. The national elections of 1924 led to
a swing to the right. Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg was elected President
in 1925. In October 1925 the Treaty of Locarno was signed by Germany, France,
Belgium, Britain and Italy; it recognised Germany's borders with France and
Belgium. Moreover, Britain, Italy and Belgium undertook to assist France in the
case that German troops marched into the demilitarised Rheinland. Locarno paved
the way for Germany's admission to the League of Nations in 1926. Economic
collapse and political problems, 1929â€“1933. The stock market crash of 1929 on
Wall Street marked the beginning of the worldwide Great Depression, which hit
Germany as hard as any nation. In July 1931, the "DarmstÃ¤tter und
Nationalbank" â€“ one of the biggest German banks â€“ failed. In early 1932,
the number of unemployed had soared to more than 6,000,000. On top of the
collapsing economy came a political crisis: the political parties represented
in the Reichstag were unable to build a governing majority in the face of
escalating extremism from the far right (the Nazis, NSDAP) and the far left
(the Communists, KPD). In March 1930, President Hindenburg appointed Heinrich
BrÃ¼ning Chancellor. To push through his package of austerity measures against
a majority of Social Democrats, Communists and the NSDAP (Nazis), BrÃ¼ning made
use of emergency decrees and dissolved Parliament. In March and April 1932,
Hindenburg was re-elected in the German presidential election of 1932. The
NSDAP was the largest party in the national elections of 1932. On 31 July 1932
the NSDAP had received 37.3% of the votes, and in the election on 6 November
1932 it received less, but still the largest share, 33.1%, making it the
biggest party in the Reichstag. The Communist KPD came third, with 15%.
Together, the anti-democratic parties of far right and far left were now able
to hold the majority of seats in Parliament, but they were at sword's point
with each other, fighting it out in the streets. The NSDAP was particularly
successful among Protestants, among unemployed young voters, among the "petite
bourgeoisie" (lower middle class) which had lost its assets in the
hyperinflation of 1923, and among the rural population. It was weakest in
Catholic areas and in large cities. On 30 January 1933, pressured by former
Chancellor Franz von Papen and other conservatives, President Hindenburg
appointed Hitler as Chancellor. Science and culture. The Weimar years saw a
flowering of German science and high culture, before the Nazi regime resulted
in a decline in the scientific and cultural life in Germany and forced many
renowned scientists and writers to flee. German recipients dominated the Nobel
prizes in science. Germany dominated the world of physics before 1933, led by
Hermann von Helmholtz, Joseph von Fraunhofer, Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit,
Wilhelm Conrad RÃ¶ntgen, Albert Einstein, Max Planck and Werner Heisenberg.
Chemistry likewise was dominated by German professors and researchers at the
great chemical companies such as BASF and Bayer and persons like Fritz Haber.
Theoretical mathematicians included Carl Friedrich Gauss in the 19th century
and David Hilbert in the 20th century. Carl Benz, the inventor of the
automobile, was one of the pivotal figures of engineering. Among the most
important German writers were Thomas Mann (1875â€“1955), Hermann Hesse
(1877â€“1962) and Bertolt Brecht (1898â€“1956). The pessimistic historian
Oswald Spengler wrote "The Decline of the West" (198â€“23) on the inevitable
decay of Western Civilization, and influenced intellectuals in Germany such as
Martin Heidegger, Max Scheler, and the Frankfurt School, as well as
intellectuals around the world. After 1933, Nazi proponents of "Aryan physics,"
led by the Nobel Prize-winners Johannes Stark and Philipp Lenard, attacked
Einstein's theory of relativity as a degenerate example of Jewish materialism
in the realm of science. Many scientists and humanists emigrated; Einstein
moved permanently to the U.S. but some of the others returned after 1945. Nazi
Germany. The Nazi regime restored economic prosperity and ended mass
unemployment using heavy spending on the military, while suppressing labor
unions and strikes. The return of prosperity gave the Nazi Party enormous
popularity, with only minor, isolated and subsequently unsuccessful cases of
resistance among the German population over the 12 years of rule. The Gestapo
(secret police) under Heinrich Himmler destroyed the political opposition and
persecuted the Jews, trying to force them into exile, while taking their
property. The Party took control of the courts, local government, and all civic
organizations except the Protestant and Catholic churches. All expressions of
public opinion were controlled by Hitler's propaganda minister, Joseph
Goebbels, who made effective use of film, mass rallies, and Hitler's hypnotic
speaking. The Nazi state idolized Hitler as its FÃ¼hrer (leader), putting all
powers in his hands. Nazi propaganda centered on Hitler and was quite effective
in creating what historians called the "Hitler Myth"â€”that Hitler was all-wise
and that any mistakes or failures by others would be corrected when brought to
his attention. In fact Hitler had a narrow range of interests and decision
making was diffused among overlapping, feuding power centers; on some issues he
was passive, simply assenting to pressures from whomever had his ear. All top
officials reported to Hitler and followed his basic policies, but they had
considerable autonomy on a daily basis. Establishment of the Nazi regime. In
order to secure a majority for his NSDAP in the Reichstag, Hitler called for
new elections. On the evening of 27 February 1933, a fire was set in the
Reichstag building. Hitler swiftly blamed an alleged Communist uprising, and
convinced President Hindenburg to sign the Reichstag Fire Decree. This decree,
which would remain in force until 1945, repealed important political and human
rights of the Weimar constitution. Communist agitation was banned, but at this
time not the Communist Party itself. Eleven thousand Communists and Socialists
were arrested and brought into hastily prepared concentration camps such as
Kemna concentration camp, where they were at the mercy of the Gestapo, the
newly established secret police force (9,000 were found guilty and most
executed). Communist Reichstag deputies were taken into protective custody
(despite their constitutional privileges). Despite the terror and unprecedented
propaganda, the last free General Elections of 5 March 1933, while resulting in
43.9% failed to bring the majority for the NSDAP that Hitler had hoped for.
Together with the German National People's Party (DNVP), however, he was able
to form a slim majority government. With accommodations to the Catholic Centre
Party, Hitler succeeded in convincing a required two-thirds of a rigged
Parliament to pass the Enabling act of 1933 which gave his government full
legislative power. Only the Social Democrats voted against the Act. The
Enabling Act formed the basis for the dictatorship, dissolution of the LÃ¤nder;
the trade unions and all political parties other than the Nazi Party were
suppressed. A centralised totalitarian state was established, no longer based
on the liberal Weimar constitution. Germany left the League of Nations. The
coalition parliament was rigged on this fateful 23 March 1933 by defining the
absence of arrested and murdered deputies as voluntary and therefore cause for
their exclusion as wilful absentees. Subsequently in July the Centre Party was
voluntarily dissolved in a "quid pro quo" with the Pope under the "anti-
communist" Pope Pius XI for the Reichskonkordat; and by these manoeuvres Hitler
achieved movement of these Catholic voters into the Nazi party, and a long-
awaited international diplomatic acceptance of his regime. It is interesting to
note, however, that according to Professor Dick Geary the Nazis gained a larger
share of their vote in Protestant areas than in Catholic areas, in the
elections held between 1928 and November 1932. The Communist Party was
proscribed in April 1933. On the weekend of 30 June 1934, he gave order to the
SS to seize RÃ¶hm and his lieutenants, and to execute them without trial (known
as the Night of the Long Knives). Upon Hindenburg's death on 2 August 1934,
Hitler's cabinet passed a law proclaiming the presidency vacant and transferred
the role and powers of the head of state to Hitler as FÃ¼hrer und Reichskanzler
(leader and chancellor). However, many leaders of the Nazi SA were
disappointed. The Chief of Staff of the SA, Ernst RÃ¶hm, was pressing for the
SA to be incorporated into the army. Hitler had long been at odds with RÃ¶hm
and felt increasingly threatened by these plans and in the "Night of the Long
Knives" in 1934 killed RÃ¶hm and the top SA leaders using their notorious
homosexuality as an excuse. The SS became an independent organisation under the
command of the "ReichsfÃ¼hrer SS" Heinrich Himmler. He would become the
supervisor of the "Gestapo" and of the concentration camps, soon also of the
ordinary police. Hitler also established the Waffen-SS as a separate troop.
Jews. The regime showed particular hostility towards the Jews, which were the
target of unending propaganda attacks. In 1933 all Jewish civil servants and
academics were fired. In September 1935, the Reichstag passed the Nuremberg
race laws. Jews lost their German citizenship, and were banned from marrying
non-Jewish Germans. About 500,000 individuals were affected by the new rules.
About half of Germany's 500,000 Jews fled before 1939, after which escape
became almost impossible. Military. Hitler re-established the Luftwaffe (air
force) and reintroduced universal military service. This was in breach of the
Treaty of Versailles; Britain, France or Italy issued notes of protest. Hitler
had the officers swear their personal allegiance to him. In 1936 German troops
marched into the demilitarised Rhineland. Britain and France did not intervene.
The move strengthened Hitler's standing in Germany. His reputation swelled
further with the 1936 Summer Olympics, which were held in the same year in
Berlin, and which proved another great propaganda success for the regime as
orchestrated by master propagandist Joseph Goebbels. Women. Historians have
paid special attention to the efforts by Nazi Germany to reverse the gains
women made before 1933, especially in the relatively liberal Weimar Republic.
It appears the role of women in Nazi Germany changed according to
circumstances. Theoretically the Nazis believed that women must be subservient
to men, avoid careers, devote themselves to childbearing and child-rearing, and
be a helpmate of the traditional dominant father in the traditional family.
However, before 1933, women played important roles in the Nazi organization and
were allowed some autonomy to mobilize other women. After Hitler came to power
in 1933, the activist women were replaced by bureaucratic women who emphasized
feminine virtues, marriage, and childbirth. As Germany prepared for war, large
numbers were incorporated into the public sector and with the need for full
mobilization of factories by 1943, all women were required to register with the
employment office. Hundreds of thousands of women served in the military as
nurses, and support personnel, and another hundred thousand served in the
Luftwaffe helping to operate the antiâ€”aircraft systems. Women's wages
remained unequal and women were denied positions of leadership or control.
Foreign policy. Hitler's diplomatic strategy in the 1930s was to make seemingly
reasonable demands, threatening war if they were not met. When opponents tried
to appease him, he accepted the gains that were offered, then went to the next
target. That aggressive strategy worked as Germany pulled out of the League of
Nations (1933), rejected the Versailles Treaty and began to re-arm (1935), won
back the Saar (1935), remilitarized the Rhineland (1936), formed an alliance
("axis") with Mussolini's Italy (1936), sent massive military aid to Franco in
the Spanish Civil War (1936â€“39), seized Austria (1938), took over
Czechoslovakia after the British and French "appeasement" of the Munich
Agreement of 1938, formed a peace pact with Joseph Stalin's Soviet Union in
August 1939, and finally invaded Poland in September 1939. Britain and France
declared war and World War II began â€“ somewhat sooner than the Nazis expected
or were ready for. After establishing the "Rome-Berlin axis" with Benito
Mussolini, and signing the Anti-Comintern Pact with Japan â€“ which was joined
by Italy a year later in 1937 â€“ Hitler felt able to take the offensive in
foreign policy. On 12 March 1938, German troops marched into Austria, where an
attempted Nazi coup had been unsuccessful in 1934. When Austrian-born Hitler
entered Vienna, he was greeted by loud cheers. Four weeks later, 99% of
Austrians voted in favour of the annexation (Anschluss) of their country
Austria to the German Reich. After Austria, Hitler turned to Czechoslovakia,
where the 3.5Â million-strong Sudeten German minority was demanding equal
rights and self-government. At the Munich Conference of September 1938, Hitler,
the Italian leader Benito Mussolini, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain
and French Prime Minister Ã‰douard Daladier agreed upon the cession of Sudeten
territory to the German Reich by Czechoslovakia. Hitler thereupon declared that
all of German Reich's territorial claims had been fulfilled. However, hardly
six months after the Munich Agreement, in March 1939, Hitler used the
smoldering quarrel between Slovaks and Czechs as a pretext for taking over the
rest of Czechoslovakia as the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. In the same
month, he secured the return of Memel from Lithuania to Germany. Chamberlain
was forced to acknowledge that his policy of appeasement towards Hitler had
failed. In six years, the Nazi regime prepared the country for World War II.
The Nazi leadership attempted to remove or subjugate the Jewish population of
Nazi Germany and later in the occupied countries through forced deportation
and, ultimately, genocide now known as the Holocaust. A similar policy applied
to the various ethnic and national groups considered subhuman such as Poles,
Roma or Russians. These groups were seen as threats to the purity of Germany's
Aryan race. There were also many groups, such as homosexuals, the mentally
handicapped and those who were physically challenged from birth, which were
singled out as being detrimental to Aryan purity. World War II. At first
Germany's military moves were brilliantly successful, as in the "blitzkrieg"
invasions of Poland (1939), Norway (1940), the Low Countries (1940), and above
all the stunningly successful invasion and quick conquest of France in 1940.
Hitler probably wanted peace with Britain in late 1940, but Prime Minister
Winston Churchill, standing alone, was dogged in his defiance. Churchill had
major financial, military, and diplomatic help from President Franklin D.
Roosevelt in the U.S., another implacable foe of Hitler. Hitler's emphasis on
maintaining high living standards postponed the full mobilization of the
national economy until 1942, years after the great rivals Britain, Russia, and
the U.S. had fully mobilized. Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June
1941Â â€“ weeks behind scheduleÂ â€“ but swept forward until it reached the
gates of Moscow. The tide turned in December 1941, when the invasion of Russia
stalled in cold weather and the United States joined the war. After surrender
in North Africa and losing the Battle of Stalingrad in 1942â€“43, the Germans
were on the defensive. By late 1944, the United States, Canada, France, and
Great Britain were closing in on Germany in the West, while the Soviets were
closing from the East. Nazi Germany collapsed as Berlin was taken by the Red
Army in a fight to the death on the city streets. Hitler committed suicide on
30 April 1945. Final German surrender was signed on 8 May 1945. By September
1945, the Third Reich (which lasted only 12 years) and its Axis partners (Italy
and Japan) had been defeated, chiefly by the forces of the Soviet Union, the
United States, and the United Kingdom. Much of Europe lay in ruins, over 60
million people had been killed (most of them civilians), including
approximately 6 million Jews and 5 million non-Jews in what became known as the
Holocaust. World War II resulted in the destruction of Germany's political and
economic infrastructure and led directly to its partition, considerable loss of
territory (especially in the east), and historical legacy of guilt and shame.
Germany during the Cold War. As a consequence of the defeat of Nazi Germany in
1945 and the onset of the Cold War in 1947, the country was split between the
two global blocs in the East and West, a period known as the division of
Germany. Millions of refugees from Central and Eastern Europe moved west, most
of them to West Germany. Two states emerged: West Germany was a parliamentary
democracy, a NATO member, a founding member of what since became the European
Union and one of the world's largest economies, while East Germany was a
totalitarian Communist dictatorship that was a satellite of Moscow. With the
collapse of Communism in 1989, reunion on West Germany's terms followed. No one
doubted Germany's economic and engineering prowess; the question was how long
bitter memories of the war would cause Europeans to distrust Germany, and
whether Germany could demonstrate it had rejected totalitarianism and
militarism and embraced democracy and human rights. Post-war chaos. The total
of German war dead was 8% to 10% out of a prewar population of 69,000,000, or
between 5.5 million and 7 million people. This included 4.5 million in the
military, and between 1 and 2 million civilians. There was chaos as 11 million
foreign workers and POWs left, while 14 million displaced refugees from the
east and soldiers returned home. At the Potsdam Conference, Germany was divided
into four military occupation zones by the Allies and did not regain
independence until 1949. The provinces east of the Oder and Neisse rivers (the
Oder-Neisse line) were transferred to Poland, Lithuania, and Russia
(Kaliningrad oblast); the 6.7 million Germans living in Poland and the 2.5
million in Czechoslovakia were forced to move west, although most had already
left when the war ended. Denazification removed, imprisoned, or executed most
top officials of the old regime, but most middle and lower ranks of civilian
officialdom were not seriously affected. In accordance with the Allied
agreement made at the Yalta conference millions of POWs were used as forced
labor by the Soviet Union and other European countries. In the East, the
Soviets crushed dissent and imposed another police state, often employing ex-
Nazis in the dreaded Stasi. The Soviets extracted about 23% of the East German
GNP for reparations, while in the West reparations were a minor factor. In
1945â€“46 housing and food conditions were bad, as the disruption of transport,
markets, and finances slowed a return to normal. In the West, bombing had
destroyed the fourth of the housing stock, and over 10 million refugees from
the east had crowded in, most living in camps. Food production in 1946â€“48 was
only two-thirds of the prewar level, while grain and meat shipments â€“ which
usually supplied 25% of the food â€“ no longer arrived from the East.
Furthermore, the end of the war brought the end of large shipments of food
seized from occupied nations that had sustained Germany during the war. Coal
production was down 60%, which had cascading negative effects on railroads,
heavy industry, and heating. Industrial production fell more than half and
reached prewar levels only at the end of 1949. Allied economic policy
originally was one of industrial disarmament plus building the agricultural
sector. In the western sectors, most of the industrial plants had minimal bomb
damage and the Allies dismantled 5% of the industrial plants for reparations.
However, deindustrialization became impractical and the U.S. instead called for
a strong industrial base in Germany so it could stimulate European economic
recovery. The U.S. shipped food in 1945â€“47 and made a $600 million loan in
1947 to rebuild German industry. By May 1946 the removal of machinery had
ended, thanks to lobbying by the U.S. Army. The Truman administration finally
realised that economic recovery in Europe could not go forward without the
reconstruction of the German industrial base on which it had previously been
dependent. Washington decided that an "orderly, prosperous Europe requires the
economic contributions of a stable and productive Germany." East Germany (GDR).
In 1949 the Soviet zone became the "Deutsche Demokratische Republik" â€“ "DDR"
("German Democratic Republic" â€“ "GDR", simply often "East Germany"), under
control of the German Communist Party. Neither country had a significant army
until the 1950s, but East Germany built the Stasi into a powerful secret police
that infiltrated every aspect of the society. East Germany was an Eastern bloc
state under political and military control of the Soviet Union through her
occupation forces and the Warsaw Treaty. Political power was solely executed by
leading members ("Politburo") of the communist-controlled Socialist Unity Party
(SED). A Soviet-style command economy was set up; later the GDR became the most
advanced Comecon state. While East German propaganda was based on the benefits
of the GDR's social programs and the alleged constant threat of a West German
invasion, many of her citizens looked to the West for political freedoms and
economic prosperity. Walter Ulbricht (1893â€“1973) was the party boss from 1950
to 1971. In 1933, Ulbricht had fled to Moscow, where he served as a Comintern
agent loyal to Stalin. As World War II was ending, Stalin assigned him the job
of designing the postwar German system that would centralize all power in the
Communist Party. Ulbricht became deputy prime minister in 1949 and secretary
(chief executive) of the Socialist Unity (Communist) party in 1950. Some 2.6
million people had fled East Germany by 1961 when he built the Berlin Wall to
stop them â€” shooting those who attempted it. What the GDR called the "Anti-
Fascist Protective Wall" was a major embarrassment for the program during the
Cold War, but it did stabilize East Germany and postpone its collapse. Ulbricht
lost power in 1971, but was kept on as a nominal head of state. He was replaced
because he failed to solve growing national crises, such as the worsening
economy in 1969â€“70, the fear of another popular uprising as had occurred in
1953, and the disgruntlement between Moscow and Berlin caused by Ulbricht's
dÃ©tente policies toward the West. The transition to Erich Honecker (General
Secretary from 1971 to 1989) led to a change in the direction of national
policy and efforts by the Politburo to pay closer attention to the grievances
of the proletariat. Honecker's plans were not successful, however, with the
dissent growing among East Germany's population. In 1989, the socialist regime
collapsed after 40 years, despite its omnipresent secret police, the Stasi.
Main reasons for the collapse include severe economic problems and growing
emigration towards the West. East Germany's culture was shaped by Communism and
particularly Stalinism. It was characterized by East German psychoanalyst Hans-
Joachim Maaz in 1990 as having produced a "Congested Feeling" among Germans in
the East as a result of Communist policies criminalizing personal expression
that deviates from government approved ideals, and through the enforcement of
Communist principals by physical force and intellectual repression by
government agencies, particularly the Stasi. Critics of the East German state
have claimed that the state's commitment to communism was a hollow and cynical
tool of a ruling elite. This argument has been challenged by some scholars who
claim that the Party was committed to the advance of scientific knowledge,
economic development, and social progress. However, the vast majority regarded
the state's Communist ideals to be a nothing more than a deceptive method for
government control. West Germany. In 1949, the three western occupation zones
(American, British, and French) were combined into the Federal Republic of
Germany (FRG, West Germany). The government was formed under Chancellor Konrad
Adenauer and his conservative CDU/CSU coalition. The CDU/CSU was in power
during most of the period since 1949. The capital was Bonn until it was moved
to Berlin in 1990. In 1990 FRG absorbed East Germany and gained full
sovereignty over Berlin. At all points West Germany was much larger and richer
that East Germany, which became a dictatorship under the control of the
Communist Party and was closely monitored by Moscow. Germany, especially
Berlin, was a cockpit of the Cold War, with NATO and the Warsaw Pact assembling
major military forces in west and east. However there was never any combat.
Economic miracle. West Germany enjoyed prolonged economic growth beginning in
the early 1950s ("Wirtschaftswunder" or "Economic Miracle"). Industrial
production doubled from 1950 to 1957, and gross national product grew at a rate
of 9 or 10% per year, providing the engine for economic growth of all of
Western Europe. Labor union supported the new policies with postponed wage
increases, minimized strikes, support for technological modernization, and a
policy of co-determination ("Mitbestimmung"), which involved a satisfactory
grievance resolution system as well as requiring representation of workers on
the boards of large corporations. The recovery was accelerated by the currency
reform of June 1948, U.S. gifts of $1.4 billion as part of the Marshall Plan,
the breaking down of old trade barriers and traditional practices, and the
opening of the global market. West Germany gained legitimacy and respect, as it
shed the horrible reputation Germany had gained under the Nazis. West Germany
played a central role in the creation of European cooperation; it joined NATO
in 1955 and was a founding member of the European Economic Community in 1958.
1948 currency reform. The most dramatic and successful policy event was the
currency reform of 1948. Since the 1930s, prices and wages had been controlled,
but money had been plentiful. That meant that people had accumulated large
paper assets, and that official prices and wages did not reflect reality, as
the black market dominated the economy and more than half of all transactions
were taking place unofficially. On 21 June 1948, the Western Allies withdrew
the old currency and replaced it with the new Deutsche Mark at the rate of 1
new per 10 old. This wiped out 90% of government and private debt, as well as
private savings. Prices were decontrolled, and labor unions agreed to accept a
15% wage increase, despite the 25% rise in prices. The result was that prices
of German export products held steady, while profits and earnings from exports
soared and were poured back into the economy. The currency reforms were
simultaneous with the $1.4 billion in Marshall Plan money coming in from the
United States, which was used primarily for investment. In addition, the
Marshall Plan forced German companies, as well as those in all of Western
Europe, to modernize their business practices and take account of the
international market. Marshall Plan funding helped overcome bottlenecks in the
surging economy caused by remaining controls (which were removed in 1949), and
Marshall Plan business reforms opened up a greatly expanded market for German
exports. Overnight, consumer goods appeared in the stores, because they could
be sold for realistic prices, emphasizing to Germans that their economy had
turned a corner. The success of the currency reform angered the Soviets, who
cut off all road, rail, and canal links between the western zones and West
Berlin. This was the Berlin Blockade, which lasted from 24 June 1948 to 12 May
1949. In response, the U.S. and Britain launched an airlift of food and coal
and distributed the new currency in West Berlin as well. The city thereby
became economically integrated into West Germany. Adenauer. Konrad Adenauer
(1876â€“1967) was the dominant leader in West Germany. He was the first
chancellor (top official) of the FRG, 1949â€“63, and until his death was the
founder and leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), a coalition of
conservatives, ordoliberals, and adherents of Protestant and Catholic social
teaching that dominated West Germany politics for most of its history. During
his chancellorship, the West Germany economy grew quickly, and West Germany
established friendly relations with France, participated in the emerging
European Union, established the country's armed forces (the "Bundeswehr"), and
became a pillar of NATO as well as firm ally of the United States. Adenauer's
government also commenced the long process of reconciliation with the Jews and
Israel after the Holocaust. Erhard. Ludwig Erhard (1897â€“1977) was in charge
of economic policy as economics director for the British and American
occupation zones and was Adenauer's long-time economics minister. Erhard's
decision to lift many price controls in 1948 (despite opposition from both the
social democratic opposition and Allied authorities), plus his advocacy of free
markets, helped set the Federal Republic on its strong growth from wartime
devastation. Norbert Walter, a former chief economist at Deutsche Bank, argues
that "Germany owes its rapid economic advance after World War II to the system
of the Social Market Economy, established by Ludwig Erhard." Erhard was
politically less successful when he served as the CDU Chancellor from 1963
until 1966. Erhard followed the concept of a social market economy, and was in
close touch with professional economists. Erhard viewed the market itself as
social and supported only a minimum of welfare legislation. However, Erhard
suffered a series of decisive defeats in his effort to create a free,
competitive economy in 1957; he had to compromise on such key issues as the
anti-cartel legislation. Thereafter, the West German economy evolved into a
conventional west European welfare state. Meanwhile in adopting the Godesberg
Program in 1959, the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) largely abandoned
Marxism ideas and embraced the concept of the market economy and the welfare
state. Instead it now sought to move beyond its old working class base to
appeal the full spectrum of potential voters, including the middle class and
professionals. Labor unions cooperated increasingly with industry, achieving
labor representation on corporate boards and increases in wages and benefits.
Grand coalition. In 1966 Erhard lost support and Kurt Kiesinger (1904â€“1988)
was elected as Chancellor by a new CDU/CSU-SPD alliance combining the two
largest parties. Socialist (SPD) leader Willy Brandt was Deputy Federal
Chancellor and Foreign Minister. The Grand Coalition lasted 1966â€“69 and is
best known for reducing tensions with the Soviet bloc nations and establishing
diplomatic relations with Czechoslovakia, Romania and Yugoslavia. Guest
workers. With a booming economy short of unskilled workers, especially after
the Berlin Wall cut off the steady flow of East Germans, the FRG negotiated
migration agreements with Italy (1955), Spain (1960), Greece (1960), and Turkey
(1961) that brought in hundreds of thousands of temporary guest workers, called
"Gastarbeiter". In 1968 the FRG signed a guest worker agreement with Yugoslavia
that employed additional guest workers. "Gastarbeiter" were young men who were
paid full-scale wages and benefits, but were expected to return home in a few
years. The agreement with Turkey ended in 1973 but few workers returned because
there were few good jobs in Turkey. By 2010 there were about 4 million people
of Turkish descent in Germany. The generation born in Germany attended German
schools, but had a poor command of either German or Turkish, and had either
low-skilled jobs or were unemployed. Brandt and Ostpolitik. Willy Brandt
(1913â€“1992) was the leader of the Social Democratic Party in 1964â€“87 and
West German Chancellor in 1969â€“1974. Under his leadership, the German
government sought to reduce tensions with the Soviet Union and improve
relations with the German Democratic Republic, a policy known as the
"Ostpolitik". Relations between the two German states had been icy at best,
with propaganda barrages in each direction. The heavy outflow of talent from
East Germany prompted the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961, which worsened
Cold War tensions and prevented East Germans from travel. Although anxious to
relieve serious hardships for divided families and to reduce friction, Brandt's
"Ostpolitik" was intent on holding to its concept of "two German states in one
German nation." "Ostpolitik" was opposed by the conservative elements in
Germany, but won Brandt an international reputation and the Nobel Peace Prize
in 1971. In September 1973, both West and East Germany were admitted to the
United Nations. The two countries exchanged permanent representatives in 1974,
and, in 1987, East Germany's leader Erich Honecker paid an official state visit
to West Germany. Economic crisis of 1970s. After 1973, Germany was hard hit by
a worldwide economic crisis, soaring oil prices, and stubbornly high
unemployment, which jumped from 300,000 in 1973 to 1.1 million in 1975. The
Ruhr region was hardest hit, as its easy-to-reach coal mines petered out, and
expensive German coal was no longer competitive. Likewise the Ruhr steel
industry went into sharp decline, as its prices were undercut by lower-cost
suppliers such as Japan. The welfare system provided a safety net for the large
number of unemployed workers, and many factories reduce their labor force and
began to concentrate on high-profit specialty items. After 1990 the Ruhr moved
into service industries and high technology. Cleaning up the heavy air and
water pollution became a major industry in its own right. Meanwhile, formerly
rural Bavaria became a high-tech center of industry. A spy scandal forced
Brandt to step down as Chancellor while remaining as party leader. He was
replaced by Helmut Schmidt (b. 1918), of the SPD, who served as Chancellor in
1974â€“1982. Schmidt continued the "Ostpolitik" with less enthusiasm. He had a
PhD in economics and was more interested in domestic issues, such as reducing
inflation. The debt grew rapidly as he borrowed to cover the cost of the ever
more expensive welfare state. After 1979, foreign policy issues grew central as
the Cold War turned hot again. The German peace movement mobilized hundreds of
thousands of demonstrators to protest against American deployment in Europe of
new medium-range ballistic missiles. Schmidt supported the deployment but was
opposed by the left wing of the SPD and by Brandt. The pro-business Free
Democratic Party (FDP) had been in coalition with the SPD, but now it changed
direction. Led by Finance Minister Otto Graf Lambsdorff (1926â€“2009) the FDP
adopted the market-oriented "Kiel Theses" in 1977; it rejected the Keynesian
emphasis on consumer demand, and proposed to reduce social welfare spending,
and try to introduce policies to stimulate production and facilitate jobs.
Lambsdorff argued that the result would be economic growth, which would itself
solve both the social problems and the financial problems. As a consequence,
the FDP switched allegiance to the CDU and Schmidt lost his parliamentary
majority in 1982. For the only time in West Germany's history, the government
fell on a vote of no confidence. Kohl. Helmut Kohl (b. 1930) brought the
conservatives back to power with a CDU/CSU-FDP coalition in 1982, and served as
Chancellor until 1998. After repeated victories in 1983, 1987, 1990 and 1994 he
was finally defeated by a landslide that was the biggest on record, for the
left in the 1998 federal elections, and was succeeded as Chancellor by Gerhard
SchrÃ¶der of the SPD. Kohl is best known for orchestrating reunification with
the approval of all the Four Powers from World War II, who still had a voice in
German affairs. Reunification. During the summer of 1989, rapid changes known
as "peaceful revolution" or "Die Wende" took place in East Germany, which
quickly led to German reunification. Growing numbers of East Germans emigrated
to West Germany, many via Hungary after Hungary's reformist government opened
its borders. Thousands of East Germans also tried to reach the West by staging
sit-ins at West German diplomatic facilities in other East European capitals,
most notably in Prague. The exodus generated demands within East Germany for
political change, and mass demonstrations in several cities continued to grow.
Unable to stop the growing civil unrest, Erich Honecker was forced to resign in
October, and on 9 November, East German authorities unexpectedly allowed East
German citizens to enter West Berlin and West Germany. Hundreds of thousands of
people took advantage of the opportunity; new crossing points were opened in
the Berlin Wall and along the border with West Germany. This led to the
acceleration of the process of reforms in East Germany that ended with the
German reunification that came into force on 3 October 1990. Recent history
(1990 to present). SchrÃ¶der. The SPD in coalition with the Greens won the
elections of 1998. SPD leader Gerhard SchrÃ¶der positioned himself as a
centrist "Third Way" candidate in the mold of Britain's Tony Blair and
America's Bill Clinton. SchrÃ¶der, in March 2003, reversed his position and
proposed a significant downsizing of the welfare state, known as Agenda 2010.
He had enough support to overcome opposition from the trade unions and the
SPD's left wing. Agenda 2010 had five goals: tax cuts; labor market
deregulation, especially relaxing rules protecting workers from dismissal and
setting up Hartz concept job training; modernizing the welfare state by
reducing entitlements; decreasing bureaucratic obstacles for small businesses;
and providing new low-interest loans to local governments. Merkel. From 2005 to
2009, Germany was ruled by a grand coalition led by the CDU's Angela Merkel as
chancellor. Since the 2009 elections, Merkel has headed a centre-right
government of the CDU/CSU and FDP. Together with France and other EU states,
Germany has played the leading role in the European Union. Germany (especially
under Chancellor Helmut Kohl) was one of the main supporters of admitting many
East European countries to the EU. Germany is at the forefront of European
states seeking to exploit the momentum of monetary union to advance the
creation of a more unified and capable European political, defence and security
apparatus. German Chancellor SchrÃ¶der expressed an interest in a permanent
seat for Germany in the UN Security Council, identifying France, Russia, and
Japan as countries that explicitly backed Germany's bid. Germany formally
adopted the Euro on 1 January 1999 after permanently fixing the Deutsche Mark
rate on 21 December 1998. Since 1990, the German Bundeswehr has participated in
a number of peacekeeping and disaster relief operations abroad. Since 2002,
German troops formed part of the International Security Assistance Force in the
war in Afghanistan, resulting in the first German casualties in combat missions
since World War II. In the worldwide economic recession that began in 2008,
Germany did relatively well. However, the economic instability of Greece and
several other EU nations in 2010â€“11 forced Germany to reluctantly sponsor a
massive financial rescue. In the wake of the disaster to the nuclear industry
in Japan following its 2011 earthquake and tsunami, German public opinion
turned sharply against nuclear power in Germany, which produces a fourth of the
electricity supply. In response Merkel has announced plans to close down the
nuclear system over the next decade, and to rely even more heavily on wind and
other alternative energy sources, in addition to coal and natural gas. For
further information, see Germany in 2011. Sonderweg debate. A major
historiographical debate about the German history concerns the "Sonderweg", the
alleged â€œspecial pathâ€ that separated German history from the normal course
of historical development, and whether or not Nazi Germany was the inevitable
result of the "Sonderweg". Proponents of the "Sonderweg" theory such as Fritz
Fischer point to such events of the Revolution of 1848, the authoritarian of
the Second Empire and the continuation of the Imperial elite into the Weimar
and Nazi periods. Opponents such as Gerhard Ritter of the "Sonderweg" theory
argue that proponents of the theory are guilty of seeking selective examples,
and there was much contingency and chance in German history. In addition, there
was much debate within the supporters of the "Sonderweg" concept as for the
reasons for the "Sonderweg", and whether or not the "Sonderweg" ended in 1945.
